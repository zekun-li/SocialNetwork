Sofianitz,1,,,"A short comment:.As to their positions on the crisis in Syria and what to do about it,   Mr Obama is fundamentally, historically and objectively wrong.  Mr. Putin is, conversely, fundamentally correct..The blame for 280,000 dead and 4 miliion displaced in Syria lies with the US.  These are the facts.  No room left to discuss or argue about them.  Plain, discernible facts.","The Russian appeasement of the imperial expansion of the US Empire that began in 1990 has witnessed the steady encroachment (despite all the assurances and other outright lies made by the US and NATO that they would not do this) of US imperialist hegemony into the countries the former Soviet Union and other countries in the soviet Eastern European bloc.  This seems to be coming to an end. Eventually the appeasment has to stop, somewhere west of the Urals.   Vladimir Putin is not Neville Chamberlin.  The appeasement stops here, in Ukraine, it seems.  If you hear the words freedom, democracy, or self determination, Ukranian people in the east, reach for your guns.","A much bigger game for Putin is to drive a wedge between the US and Germany.  And also France, maybe.  A much bigger game.","Bill.I don't mean to quibble about words, like encircle or popular will, but only to point out what has happened.  Despite Western promises, NATO has moved-in on the East.  Nobody can  dispute that.  It is an undeniable fact.  You think Putin hasn't noticed that all the Western promises have been broken?","Whatever Ms. Berry's thoughts are about Russian Stalinist writer Aleksander Prokhanov, his assertion is that America consumes country after country.  In the case of the former Soviet-bloc countries of Easten Europe, and also some former Soviet Union members. this assertion is true. That no one can refute.  The West and NATO have been moving-in-on and encircling Russia since 1989, despite all the pious assertions made to Gorbachev and others that they would not do this.  Peter.Beinart has written a brief article in this month's The Atlantic magazine describing this encirclement..<a hrefhttp:www.theatlantic.cominternationalarchive201403no-american-weakness-didnt-encourage-putin-to-invade-ukraine284168 titlehttp:www.theatlantic.cominternationalarchive201403no-american-weakness-didnt-encourage-putin-to-invade-ukraine284168 targetblank>http:www.theatlantic.cominternationalarchive201403no-american-wea...<a>.Perhaps Vladimir Putin did not decide to make an ideological change, but instead was driven into the arms of the likes of Mr. Prokhanov by Western actions.",,,,,
ron,1,,,Those moronic commentators are a security threat to Russia. Neither the West nor Ukraine can be trusted with a warm weather port for the Russian navy. That's why Putin wants Crimea.,,,,,,,,,
SV1005,,1,,"Continued....6. Not sure which Russian Intellectuals Mr. Cohen was talking about, none that I know would ever say such things. They are forward and Westward looking, and would love nothing more than to be integrated with Europe and the West in general..7. The rise of Russian patriotism is the product of continued isolation and demonization of Russia because of Putin. Too bad that the rest of Russia has to suffer because of what this dictator does....8. Continuing to isolate Russia will bring more of the same, and it might well turn Russia into another North Korea - then what???.9. As for what to do with Ukraine - it should be allowed to split if they so desire. Eastern and Western Ukraine are as different as Poland and Russia, because that's what they are. Czechoslovakia was allowed to split - why not Ukraine? They have never been nor will ever be happy together, eastern and western Ukrainians. Half of my family is from Eastern Ukraine, they've never even traveled to Western Ukraine all their lives - they are afraid of them!.10. And finally, as for Putin - he will only leave when HE wants to, nothing short of an armed uprising will drive him out. That's the sad part. And that's why I personally hate him with vengeance, because he single-handedly undid everything we fought for in the early 90s, when we stood in front of the tanks on the Red Square, and put Eltsin on top of one of them. All is now gone, because of Putin.","Oh, boy, who thought this move would deter Russia?! What I see is the escalation of the Ukraine war in the next 2-4 weeks. Putin will bring his Army in a short order, because Putin will not lose face in face of such aggression. Now US and NATO gave him an excuse to do what he really wanted to do from the get-go: invade Eastern Ukraine, and annex it to Russia..So, when Putin does this, what is USNATO going to do? Go to war with Russia?! Puhleeze. I think they are going to scuttle back, and hope for the best, and the Dictator Putin will have even higher approval rating..Sheesh! Don't they have anyone thinking in the PentagonNATO anymore???!!!","I think Putin already gets this.  .Thinker, I am afraid that people like you, me and so many others who have made wonderful logical arguments as to why this is a bad idea are just being nave by taking this move as a genuine one..I am afraid the reality is a very cynical political move to pacify the domestic warmongers (McCain, Graham etc), and they needy, whiney Eastern European allies who always cry The Russian Wolf is coming!.and folks like you and me are just spectators in this theater. Until somebody makes the wrong move and starts a war, that is. Then you know what happens: body bags, atrocities, genocide, etc..A really scary theater this foreign politicking has become - my question is: WHY? Why does it have to be so? To win votes? To win bonuses? Kudos? Contracts? Really scary.","I am really out of words now to explain how stupid this move is. This escalation will bring more escalation. The war in Ukraine will be even more protracted. Putin will NOT be deterred by this stupid move - for stupid he is not. Neither he is blind. It is obvious this move is done for domestic consumption, to pacify our own war-mongers such as McCain and the new crop of GOP Presidential candidates, because Obama hates to be called weak and soft in foreign policy..The all-out war with Russia is still not going to be enough to deter Putin - just because it must be won first. History shows it's not quite that easy, and every invader of Russia lost some territory of their own when Russia beat them back..Unless we are talking a nuclear war - then the original idea of deterring Putin will look even more stupid than it looks now, as blowing up the entire World is a really heavy price to pay for deterring Putin..And no, I am not a PutinKremlin troll. I am a Russian immigrant living in the US for the past 20 years, I am a child of the USSR and the Cold War, and I hate Putin for what he did to my mother country..But I can see through the stupid politics of American warmongers, and all I can do is to shake my head in despair, as these people do not know that one stupid mistake just MIGHT trigger a World War, like it happened 100 years ago. Or they think it'd still be OK, bc the war will be in Europe, and not the US?!","ISIS seems to be a way more aggressive than Russia, but Obama plans to send only 450 new troops to Iraq in fight against ISIS. 10 times less than to the Baltic countries. ..You know why? Because Obama knows those 5,000 troops he sends to Europe will all come home alive - Putin is not a madman to start an all-out war, in spite of what the Baltics think..Only 450 to fight Iraq - and only as advisers - is because ISIS will NOT hesitate to kill Americans or whoever, and Obama does not want any body bags in his name..Putin is a vile, nasty critter, but he is no dumb. He will not attack Eastern Europe nor the Baltics - and THEY know it, too! But they still cry wolf because they want American military, American bases - in short, American dollars. As you may know, their economies are quite stagnant, and it's hard to make it when you do not produce or have anything worth of selling.","Would Putin have dared grab Crimea if thousands of US soldiers had been on the ground there?.Yes,  he would.",,,,

Jim,,1,,"This article is outlandishly simplistic and one-sided.  Putin never spoke out against an investigation into alleged corruption in FIFA.  He was actually quite cautious not to appear to take this untenable position.  He spoke out against the USAs hegemony-oriented dominance in the matter.  Why, of all nations, was the USA at the point on this matter?  Other more involved nations should have taken the lead.  And, in fact, the timing of the moves against FIFA leadership is a curious matter, which can be reasonably speculated upon.  However, Russias foreign minister, Lavrov, very clearly discounted any speculation that this action against FIFA corruption was targeting Russia in any way.  Smearing Putin the way Cohen does in this article is far beneath the intellectual and professional stature a NYTimes columnist should exhibit and is indicative of just how far the Times has slipped into yellow journalism.  This is the sort of crude, unbalanced warmongering that gets nations oriented towards actual war.  Its utterly irresponsible in even unrespectable periodicals.","These are soviet people. Let them go to Russia, along with their friends in Donetsk, and stick Mr. Putin with the bill to rebuild their economies.  Central and Western Ukraine, and the rest of Eastern Ukraine, can make their turn to democratic Europe. Perhaps in a generation or two, the children and grandchildren of Donetsk will work to reunify the country.","Mr. Putin being shunned by NATO and the G8 or G7, has diminished his stardom in Russia as a world leader.  Mr. Obama should not give Mr. Putin the stage - keep him isolated.",Putin is a racist. He has no respect for Obama just because of skin color. Because of that of course Obama is not going to want to deal with Putin. Obama is going to have to though. He has to stop avoiding him and man up.,"In one simple sentence, it is about frickin time. Putin has been lying to the world for months and th west alas smiled politely back at him. He needs NATO tanks staring him squarely in the face. Many years ago I traded letters with a General in the Czech army about developing an EuTO, an Eastern Europe Treatoy Organization  where the Baltic states and the newly freed states of Eastern Europe sign a mutual defense treaty.,somthwtbifmrussian troops March into one country like they are in the Ukraine today all the Eastern European states can join forces and defend themselves as one. Now I the time to put this into action. Lithuatian and Latvian troops need to,moe into the Ukraine and lush the Russians out. This war I eastern Urkarine is 80 pct Russian and 20 percent Ukrainean.","Everyone, look at how reasonable Putin is..Let's negotiate with him. After all, negotiation is the way of the 21st century. Mankind has evolved. How could anyone even think in 19th century terms?.Mea Culpa! Reset! Kumbayah!","Putin is acting just like a feudal king or czar.  His closest supporters get untold wealth.  If they fall out of favor they are prosecuted on trumped up charges and lucky to escape with their lives.  And like any such king, seizing other territory is a frequent priority.  I do not recommend war over this or Ukraine but the sanctions are well justified.","Putin's face will illustrate dictionary definitions of cynicism for decades to come.  He has no intention of improving the situation in Syria, let alone solving the problem.  It's to Putin's advantage if he has an ally, Assad, in power, and that's the full extent of his concern.  He'll bomb ISIS if and when ISIS threatens Damascus, but until then he's perfectly content to let the extremists thrive, if only to bedevil the US and its allies.","Putin is helping Assad at least partially because he is honoring his 2012 pledge to the leader of the Russian Orthodox church to protect Christians in Syria. <a hrefhttp:www.nytimes.com20120601worldeuroperussian-church-opposes-syrian-intervention.html titlehttp:www.nytimes.com20120601worldeuroperussian-church-opposes-syrian-intervention.html targetblank>http:www.nytimes.com20120601worldeuroperussian-church-opposes-sy...<a>  ..I applaud Putin for his stand. Christians make up 10 of the Syrian population and Assad, as brutal as he is, managed to protect the Christians from the Islamists. Now, with ISIS and Al Qaeda running loose, the Christians there are fair game.  ..I won't be voting Assad, Saddam Hussein, and Khadafy any humanitarian awards, but at least they ran stable countries by Middle Eastern standards where non-Muslims were afforded a degree of protection.",The drunken cab driver was my favorite bit player in Mr. Shteyngart's very entertaining and informative virtual return to Russia.  I wondered if the cab driver worked for Uber or was he an independent contractor?..Rather than attacking Russia at some future date perhaps we could find a way to take out their vodka reservoirs.  Maybe they would sober-up and set things right...Thank you for this excellent snapshot of Mr. Putin's Russia.
pkbormes,,1,,"I have long thought of politics as a circle, where the extreme left and the extreme right meet. Both are essentially autocratic. For example, it wasn't so long ago that extremely right wing American politicians were admiring Putin for his decisiveness and apparent strength, as opposed to what they considered our wishy washy democratically elected President...We must remain watchful lest our own extreme Right devolves into a fascist party such as Ms. Le Pen's...Let's hope President Obama and Ms. Merkel can hold the alliance together against Mr. Putin.",Absurd. Russia is practically bankrupt.  The Russian people's capacity for suffering is the only thing that is propping up Putin's corrupt autocratic government.,"The US is turning Russia into an enemy? No, it's Putin's who's doing this through his efforts to destabilize and control a sovereign country.","My, how all the old anti-Communists just love Putin's phony tough guy image.","What else do you expect us to do? Start a full blown war with Russia in which millions on all sides will be killed? Do you have any solutions that you could present?..There's a reason why NATO countries don't have the stomach for a true war over Ukraine, and it's true that Ukraine is too weak to defend itself.  Putin recognized he had a wonderful opportunity to seize Ukraine and begin to recreate a new Soviet Union. It makes him powerful and popular, for it's what most of the Russian people want...Putin simply found himself in a very good place.","Exactly. If they love Putin for his manly strength, they should love the tough and violent Kaydrov even more...Tom Cotton's already used the Hitler analogy in the first five minutes of his maiden speech. ..GOP: Strength, Violence, Thuggery..Kadyrov and Putin: the same..Birds of a feather flock together.","I think Putin really does hold all the aces. 1) Nobody is going to fight a nuclear super power. 2)The Russians love their super nationalistic leader, and they are quite used, as a people, to doing without. 3)The German elites have too much money invested in Russian energy to put up a fight.","I think it is charitable to believe that Mr. Snowden is a naive, immature and narcissistic individual with a narrow technical intelligence. As such, he probably believed his revelations were doing something positive for the American people. But he has certainly gotten in over his head, and Putin has checkmated him...Of course, the above is the charitable version. The uncharitable version is that he was a Russian shill all along.","Putin has a losing hand and slowly he will come to that realization...That is, if somebody doesn't bump him off before said realization.","Mr. Nice Guy Putin thinks that allowing a humanitarian corridor for exiting Ukrainian soldiers makes him look good. It may work with the Russian nationalists until their supermarket shelves go bare, and with the oligarchs, until they can no longer purchase dollars. After that, Putin had better watch his back. He will have invited plenty of enemies...And shame on Americans who continue to  admire the  smarts of this ex-KGB monster."
AH2,1,,,So exactly what did President Obama achieve attacking Putin in public in front of the UN. Even worse that Putin spoke right after him. Rather than what he did President Obama could have avoided pointedly condemning Putin in this way and been more indirect and general  in his comments  saying for example  too many countries that could use their influence for good rather create conflict. Everyone would have known what Obama meant...As disappointing as it it may be this is the real world and we need Putin and Russia's cooperation to bring any kind of peace and stability to the Middle East. True leaders deal with the reality of power to achieve useful goals and put aside the fantasy they prefer no matter how much better it would be if it cannot be achieved.,"This article simply reflects the same lack of reality that the U.S. and the rest of the West displays toward Putin and Russia that Putin is making bad decisions either motivated by some sinister motive or illogical decision making while our side acts logically in the best interest of humanity. This is nothing but an extension of the Cold War into the 21st century...In reality it is not complicated Putin is doing EXACTLY what what Obama, Merkel, Cameron and the others are promoting his country's interest and seeking advantages. The Good vs, Evil nonsense that the West bases its policy toward Russia on is ridiculous. Both in Ukraine and Syria we should be negotiating with him and seeking cooperation from Russia rather than hurling needless threats that accomplish nothing...Ukraine is a mess and corrupt to the core with no good prospects. and Putin is not the reason. Syria is an even bigger mess and again Putin is not the cause. But when Obama and the others talk and act as though he is all that do is ignore any possibility of solutions chasing a bogey man of their own creation.",Obama's caution aside this is an example of treating others as equals if we are serious about negotiating. You cannot treat the other side as inferior and constantly issues threats and expect Russians or anyone else to accept such treatment...Most of the time U'S. diplomacy is an oxymoron. There is good reason so much of the world sees the U.S. as bullies and worst of all that results in setback after setback for the United States. It is exactly the same problem in the Middle East...If Obama was the president we really need he would have gone out to The Rose Garden this afternoon to publicly applaud this deal with Putin and the Russians and putting even more pressure on them to comply...Instead Obama sits in his office and  sounds a cautious if not skeptical note according to The Times. Too bad. How sad....,"Whether or nor Russian operatives are in Ukraine this evidence is a joke. ..A few fuzzy photos of a guy with a long beard. Better yet the jacket patch supposedly identifying a Russian special forces member. Yes they would be sure to wear patches identifying themselves. Or how about having equipment that looks Russian. Guess what the side that the U.S. favors their Kiev based army has all Russian equipment too...This is a farce. Is this the best the CIA and U.S, military can do with all their expensive sophisticated equipment. Where is all our money going, They could have at least made sharper photos on their computers you would think. The question is why can't manufacture better  evidence ??..But worst of all remains the way the New York Times is uncritically reporting this propaganda. For those who don't get it the war on terrorism is running out of steam and the ever present military-industrial complex needs a new bogie man and Putin fills the bill very well. Guaranteed more to come.",This may be the most convoluted Times editorial ever. ..The Times editorial board states here they have no idea who shot down the Malaysian jetliner but Putin is responsible for it no matter who did it or why...That certainly simplifies the issue.,"This line for this article says it all in reference to U.S. Presidents referring to Putin and as such about Russia itself . ....They saw him through their own lens, believing he viewed Russias interests as they thought he should...Could this entire matter and the longer history be any more transparent. The U.S. and the EU want to dominate Russia and gain more power. SURPRISE. Russia does not want to be dominated by foreign countries. This is nothing more than normal geo politics...It is sad the American people are not mature enough to appreciate this and demand a more intelligent foreign policy from our government. And that the media as always is complicit in supporting this mindless good vs. evil view of international relations.",Yes the situation is very simple to understand but yet other than this Op-Ed with all the coverage there has been virtually no mention of Russia's  REAL interest.

Alan Sabrosky,,,1,"Well, reflecting on the past two decades and more of American bellicosity even since the end of the Cold War - military interventions, contrived wars, savaging air attacks, cross-border drone attacks, and the rest - the real issue is not how to confront andor contain Putin's Russia. It is how the world in general needs to first confront and then to contain the US, no matter who sits in the White House. All else is detail...And while I truly hate to say it, but Russia - with the cooperation of China - is taking the lead in that enterprise first in Syria and now in UkraineCrimea. The real tragedy of it all is that America has not just lost the moral imperative (which is not to say that Russia and China have it) - it has taken the initiative to drive a stake through its heart. Imperial America, indeed - what a come-down.","If what Russia has done under Putin merits what the editorial board recommends, then what the US has done under several presidents over the past 20-plus years merits far worse - our victims already number in seven figures, and we are just getting warmed up.","Sounds like a more articulate version of Bush Jr defending the needless and contrived US attack on Iraq, or Obama posturing on Afghanistan &amp; Syria &amp; Iran - wonder why our victims these days are mostly in the Middle East? I do not care much for Putin's agenda, and I loathed the old USSR, but it is pretty clear that the USSR was a major obstacle to US military intervention abroad and that a resurgent Russia can do the same. Besides, Russia's interests in Ukraine are a LOT more compelling than ours were in places like Grenada.","Sounds like a more articulate version of Bush Jr defending the needless and contrived US attack on Iraq, or Obama posturing on Afghanistan &amp; Syria &amp; Iran - wonder why our victims these days are mostly in the Middle East?

soccermum,,1,,Leave it to Putin to ask a country to remove its own troops from its own territory,Much of Putin's actions are driven by a desire to recreate the good old days under the hammer and sickle.   Recent anti-protest laws and state media control would make Stalin proud.,Putin won't stop until Ukraine is in economic and emotional ruin and Ukraine comes running back to papa.   He's in no rush and is wiling to draw it out as long as he has to in order achieve his goals.,"You are correct.  One thing that the Ukrainian crisis has made perfectly clear is that Putin will stop at nothing to stay in power.  Once he saw the protestors in Maidan and watched his puppet Yanukovytch flee in the dark, he knew he would have to squash any descent in his own borders.","Besides trying to trying to recreate the failed Soviet state, Putin also wanted to send a message to his own people that they better not try to do what the Ukrainians did, that is oust their corrupt president Yanukovytch.  Now Putin has painted himself into a corner with no easy way out.  HE'd rather save face with his own people then do the right thing.","Problem is that Europe relies on Russian oil and gas.  That's why they have been very slow to act.  Also, many European banks and businesses are in deep with Russia, making harsh economic sanctions unlikely without harming Europe's fragile economy.  ..I'm not sure if Putin was just lucky or if he planned it that way - if planned he is an evil mastermind like few others.

Ray Finch,,1,,"I spend a lot of time monitoring the Russian media. I cant count the number of times the days major media story deals with Putin seated at a big table with his subordinates or standing in front of a large audience (like today) where Putin spells out how he wants the country to be run. Over the past year, blaming Russias problems on foreigners (especially Americans) has become increasingly common. Whats wrong with Russia is actually revealed in these well-scripted performances. Todays harangue was another vivid example of using the West as a convenient bogeyman to cover up Kremlin sins. ..Watching his performances, the rapt, silent listeners pay homage to Putin, nodding in agreement, telling the boss just what he wants to hear, hoping to gain favor and avoid punishment. Until Russians begin to act like genuine citizens, willing to tell the Dear Leader where he is wrong, their country will continue to decline. Russians have still not learned the revolutionary concept that the power of the state should stem from the consent of the governed.",,,,,,,,,

Go Putin!..Every country in the ex-bloc made a fatal mistake- we should have gone West politically, but not economically.

Jim David,,1,,Putin has reached the pinnacle of what it means to be....drumroll please....Hugo Chavez!,"I think that as long as Putin thinks something is funny, he does it.  If he gets political points at home, so much the better.  To what extent anyone can think of a way to bring Russia into the 21st century, I don't know who or what that means may be.  I can only suggest that the way to start doing so is to somehow wipe the smile off his face.","Putin is writing his own sour epitaph by eliminating any western morally compromising alternatives.  As he moves forward with his singularly insular agenda, Russia falls farther back....into the abyss of insanely-shuttered thinking that can only lead to a return to economic-Stalinism for the Russian people.","I disagree totally with the Senator, he's not objective in this matter.  In 72 hours, the entire armies of NATO could be scrambled to defend Ukraine's borders, and we could put a tactical nuke into Crimea....if we wanted to.  Since neither NATO nor we are going to act in that manner, Putin will do what he wants....it has nothing to do with appearances.  As for the rest of the world getting more dangerous, try our city streets at night, or our schools, with every NRA-gun out there they have become the true immediate danger to our society.",,,,,,
qcell,1,,,"The US does not need Russia to solve the Syria Crisis.  We need effective and decisive leadership.  But Obama dug himself and our Nation into a hole with his ineffective, waffling politics in this crisis and he needs Putin to pull him out of the hole.  Obama needs Putin much more than Putin needs Obama.  This will be another losing debacle for the US as Obama gives away our National interest to get his deal with Putin to save himself politically.  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands more will become casualties of a disaster of our Nation's making.","After Obama's statements outlining US's planned very limited commitment, it is no wonder Putin is toughening his tone.  He would be negligent as a leader if he did not.  I guess the Ukrainians now regret disarming their nuclear weapons under guarantees for their national security.","Obama and the US are wrong to demonize Putting and Russia for the downing of the Malaysian jet.  ..In 1988, the US shot down an Iran Airline jet.  It was done by our Military even with all of its technology for identifying aircraft...Incidents like this can happen without malicious intent especially if you choose to fly your aircraft over a war zone.  ..Obama's demonization of Putin and Russia will only serve to escalate the animosity between Nations when rapprochement is needs.  Furthermore Obama seems so disconnected as one day he seem to be wavering and then the next day he is so harsh in his viewpoint.",Obama and US should take a lesson from Putin and Russia for forceful and aggressive pursuit of National interests.  So far Obama's dithering has let to chaos in all of the Arab world that is exploited by terrorists and loss of credibility in the US.  The adversaries in the Arab world respect the firm use of force and Putin has stepped up to the role and I hope he delivers.  It is the only hope for stability in the area.,,,,,,
Kenan Porobic,1,,,"Unfortunately, Mr. Cohen is strategically wrong...Blaming Mr. Putin for anything is foolish. His authoritarianism, corruption and vices are not our problem but THEIRS...What are OUR problems?..We failed to protect idea of shared living space among the people of different ethnicity, religion, culture or worldviews...Whom did we install in Afghanistan and Iraq? Several mini-Putins. Are we really going to claim that Karzai and al-Maliki were any better than the Russian president? Maybe significantly weaker but equally corrupted, sectarian and hateful.....We have encroached on the wrong course in the early nineties. ..We should have managed to protect and preserve the idea of former Yugoslavia. Keeping the peaceful and functioning state on the already established course was much easier than going through a decade of the bloody wars. Preemptively controlling a tiny butcher from Belgrade called Slobodan Milosevic from launching the cruel regional wars and destroying Yugoslavia during pre-Putin era by emphasizing that the locals should cherish what they had in common instead of obsessing about their differences was very easy...The identical objective was achieved several decades earlier by an insignificant locksmith from a tiny village called Kumrovec. His name? Josip Broz Tito.....When did he accomplish this noble objective? During the WWI by simultaneously fighting the Nazis.....His resources? A good idea and ten fingers.....Thats how you stop Putin and protect Ukraine...","Do you remember that four years ago Tom Friedman and the other experts assured us that any opposition to Bashir Assad, a bloodthirsty Syrian dictator, would be by default very progressive and moderate?..Our worst problem is not the Russian government and Mr. Putin but Washington D.C...Do you remember that over the last five decades our government in attempt to curb the spread of socialism across the globe orchestrated and aided the military coups that overthrew democratically elected liberal governments in Tehran and Santiago, and removed from power the pro-socialist Bath parties and secular dictators in Iraq, Libya and Syria while protecting extremely conservative rulers in Saudi Arabia that financed and spread fundamentalist religious movement Wahabbism, the very ideological source behind Al Qaeda and ISIS?..Are we going to repeat the identical kind of mistake in Ukraine?..The best solution is not to confront Putin and Russia militarily and economically but to invite them to the international conference where both sides could publically admit own failures, reverse the wrong steps and restore civility and friendly relationship between the residents of Ukraine. Dont get me wrong, the Russian fondness for meddling into the domestic affairs of the foreign countries almost got me killed in Sarajevo two decades ago, but we all make the mistakes...Any attitude that blames only one side for all the world problems leads to even more fighting and worse bloodsheds...","Is this a new plan? ..We will discuss incompetence and corruption of the Russian government and Moscow will analyze the same kind of failings here in America?..The problem we witness in Ukraine has several millennium old roots. We the people have betrayed all the Prophets, including Moses, Christ and Mohammed, from the very beginning and ever since. ..Do you know why Moses never led the ancient Jews to the Promised Land during his life? ..He couldnt do it because God directed him otherwise. God prohibited the killings of other human beings. The Almighty created all of us and gave His Commandments to everybody. Whether the others will use His wisdom is their choice, not ours. So the ancient Jews after Moses death distorted the original message, claimed that the Almighty entitled them to wipe out the locals and grabbed their land... ..The same is going on ever since.....After Christ repeated Gods real commandments, we the people rebelled and let him die on the cross because we preferred the leaders who wanted the wars and bloodsheds...The ancient Arabs did the same to Mohammed. Immediately after his death they sinned and started idolizing own culture and waging the bloody wars to spread their influence and grab even more power...Should anybody be shocked that Mr. Putin is doing exactly the same all over again?","The primary goal of the EU leadership should be to calm Putin nerves in Kremlin, break under-a-siege mentality within the Russian government and restore a good neighbor ties across Ukraine...As the first step, lets restore what Ukraine used to be  a normally functioning country...To calm both sides, lets give them what they both want - assurance that only together Ukraine and Russia would be entitled to join the NATO and the EU...Such an assurance would encourage Kremlin to voluntarily work on rebuilding Ukraine.....It beats me to see how Ukraine could instantly join either NATO or the EU if Bosnia has faced almost unsurpassable obstacles to meet the necessary requirements over the last two decades...","Tom Friedman is extremely valuable columnist. He always picks a wrong side in a conflict. We can reliably use his input to make the correct decisions...I remember sending him an email more than a dozen years ago advising him to strongly oppose the Iraq War. I used Bulgarias support for George W. Bush warmongering efforts in the UN Security Council as a very bad omen by pointing out that this eastern European country has lost every war over the last century, from the Second Balkan War, WWI and WWII to the Cold War. ..When you have such an ally supporting your policies you should be extremely worried. He replied it was a brilliant joke but stayed on the wrong course anyway...The worst threat to the world security is not Mr. Putin but the Saudi King. ..Already the dozens millions of Arabs were living on the very verge of starvation and poverty. When you slash the oil prices, the most important revenue source for the Arab world by 50, then you dramatically inflame despair, hunger and helplessness in the region to the astronomic levels...A trillion dollar question is whether such terrible human conditions will swell the ranks of ISIS and Al Qaeda or the reformers within the Muslim world...When you cannot feed your hungry kids and take care of your family basic needs, an alleged shortcut to the heaven and martyrdom status suddenly is more appealing than before...","As somebody who suffered immensely for three years in completely surrounded war-torn Sarajevo, deprived of basic life necessities like water, food, power, freedom of movement, heating during extremely harsh winter months or good night sleep due to millions of bullets and bombs falling all over the city, I can assure you that the western elite supported a fascist Milosevic regime in destroying ex-Yugoslavia because they saw it as the shortest way to destroying Titos socialist, secular, and all-inclusive society at the edges of European Union.....I might be personally biased for seeing the crisis in Ukraine exactly in the same way. It seems to me the West intentionally destroyed the good neighborhood relationships in Ukraine to undermine and limit Putins influence...By the way, by destroying Titos socialism in Yugoslavia, the West enabled Putin to increase his political influence in the eastern parts of that former country...","If we compared Pope Francis to Russian president Putin, the first one would be much bigger sinner...Nobody has ever heard Mr. Putin claiming that he speaks in name of God or that he is Gods representative on the Earth. Thats such a blasphemy that it cannot be cleaned by all the oceans on this planet...Popes authority came from the Roman Emperors, not from the Almighty. It was some Rome Emperor who came up with idea of establishing the Vatican to easier control the conquered people of the colossal Empire. ..The internal organization of the Vatican is identical to the military organization and hierarchy of the ancient Roman Empire. Nobody on the Earth could challenge authority of the Emperors and the Popes...Of course, to easier manipulate the Vatican, the Emperors headquartered it in Rome, not in the Holy Land where Jesus Christ walked, worked, lived and died...Even extremely cruel killing of Christ by the Romans was misinterpreted and presented as His personal choice to die for our sins...God is merciful and He doesnt need any human sacrifices if He wants to bless us with His forgiveness...The religions are distortion of true faith, all of them. The other claims that the Almighty authorized them to kill and ethnically cleanse the natives as if our Lord doesnt love all of us as our Creator. The third is in bed with the Saudi royalties for the sake of barrels of oil. ..Compared to them, Mr. Putin looks like a poster child","Adolph Hitler tried to create the Third Reich and we had to stop him in the WWII. ..Has everything afterwards been an inertia and a repetitive use of same explanation?..We had to stop the Warsaw Pact from conquering the world and spreading the communism across the globe. The question is since the Russians obviously oppressed all of them, from East Germany and Poland over Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to Ukraine, was there any real chance that Moscow could ever conquer all those small countries and the US, Britain, Germany and France? Were the Russians such a danger if they never throughout history could accomplish anything remotely similar?..We had to stop Saddam Hussein from conquering the entire Middle East. Only later we learned that Saddam actually was preventing the Iranian influence from spreading across the Gulf and already had a tough job oppressing the majority of Iraqis (the Shiites and the Kurds)...We had to stop the Al Qaeda from conquering the world in the name of radical Islam. That could only be accomplished by limiting our civil liberties and spying on the fellow citizens. Thats the problem with those Arabs, when they are peaceful, they are extremely incompetent and incapable of normal democracy, and the White House had to deal with the kings and princes for decades. The Arabs cant free themselves but can conquer us!..Most recently, we had to stop Putin in Ukraine from rebuilding the USSR and spreading his authoritarian regime all over the Europe...","Why do we blame Putin for the internal failures of Ukraine? ..Why do the Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine trust more somebody living hundreds kilometers away in Moscow that their first neighbors or the government in Kiev?..Blaming Putin for internal schism of Ukrainian society is wrong. He might have exploited it but he didnt create it...The question is who did it. Have we heard anybody offering any sensible answer, including Washington D.C., Brussels or Moscow?","Mr. Putin is not our problem. Washington D.C. is our problem...It only takes a short step to prove this point. Lets immediately balance the federal budget either by increasing the federal taxes or by dramatically cutting the benefits...If those actions dont push our economy into nosedive fall, we have no problem. ..However, if the fundamental principle of good economic system  paying the bills  creates another Great Recession or Great Depression, then we have to immediately fix our economy...We cannot blame Mr. Putin for the potential structural deficiencies of the US economy. The longer we stay on the wrong course, the more the overall economic situation will deteriorate...The question is whether we are on the wrong course. We should stress test our economy in the same way we stress tested our banks."

josie8,,1,,"Mr. Putin is a very cunning man.  Give him a year or more to prove he has no other designs up his sleeve, but at this time, it would be the height of folly to back track or relent or even think of granting a reprieve.  The fact that our Congress so quickly approved 1 billion dollars in aid to Ukraine may be part of Mr. Putin's seeking an out.  Money does talk.. Do Not Go To Sochi,  G-8 members.  Stay away from Russia for a minimum of 12 months.  The situation is still volatile.","Do not deal with Mr.Putin.  Let him stay in Sochi, his favorite resort, while the other G-8 Summit leaders convene in a hospitable area to discuss world issues.  Mr.Putin is behaving like an old world despot, in the order of Joseph Stalin, one of his heroes, and others...Move the  G-8 Summit to another venue.  Some inconvenience, but no blood, no intimidation, no force, no tanks, or strutting military, just civilized leaders trying to keep peace in the world after so many wars. .. Mr. Vladimir Putin is out of it and extremely dangerous.  He is, by Ms Merkel's account,in another world.  Leave him out of the G-8 Summit in June, move it to a friendly world.","What is it in the Russian psyche that craves an oligarchy?.Is the Russian populace still dreaming of Czars and Czarinas?   Is it in their DNA?.The corruption in post-Communist Russia probably spoiled any attempt at representative government, or any capitalistic economy there, if there ever was such a dream in the general population..The men in the picture accompanying this article look so western but their minds are in Cossack Land or Tartar World.  It looks like that's Mr. Medvedev, on Mr. Putin's right.  Lucky for Mr. Medvedev...he's still in the picture.","You are very cautious and kind here, Mr. Brooks..I think Mr. Putin has lost his grip on reality, he's living in a fantasy world of his own making.  It's one of Power and Fear, modeled from the past.   He reminds me of the many feared dictators in history, some from his own country, e.g., Stalin, and other madmen from other countries.  They have the same mind set, the same views, the same methods of operation.  They are the thought police. It is impossible to deal with them, because they are not dealing with reality...If he wants to move Russia beyond the image of the Big Bear, then stop acting like the Big Bear.  I don't think Mr. Putin is going to stop, because he cannot..His mind is fixed in unreality and the past.","The economic sanctions imposed on Russia by President Obama are the best way of showing that the rest of the world is serious about Mr. Putin's recent aggression in Crimea.  While it's true that civilians may suffer at least temporarily as may world markets as a whole, the alternatives are more violence and more Russian military involvement. The effects of that could be far worse than sanctions. Mr. Putin needs to know this and the nations supporting the sanctions need to be firm and strong in their resolve with further sanctions..Mr. Putin hasn't shown a lot of concern for the citizens of Russia by spending 50 billion on the Sochi site.  If he wants to recover his investment in that venture, he ought to realize that he's way off track.  I would think that international travelers are not planning many trips to Sochi or any other resort in Russia.  Sochi is one of his dreams fulfilled and so he moves on...Mr. Putin is a rogue wave at this point in civilization.  If he is dreaming of a grand return to the glories of Russian past, he would be better off waking up..The past comes back only in dreams and in Mr. Putin's case,  getting there is a very bad dream for the rest of the world..We would be wise to wake up to this ourselves.","You are very cautious and kind here, Mr. Brooks..I think Mr. Putin has lost his grip on reality, he's living in a fantasy world of his own making.  It's one of Power and Fear, modeled from the past.   He reminds me of the many feared dictators in history, some from his own country, e.g., Stalin, and other madmen from other countries.  They have the same mind set, the same views, the same methods of operation.  They are the thought police. It is impossible to deal with them, because they are not dealing with reality...If he wants to move Russia beyond the image of the Big Bear, then stop acting like the Big Bear.  I don't think Mr. Putin is going to stop, because he cannot..His mind is fixed in unreality and the past.","Mr. Putin is going by the Playbook.  We've seen this strategy before, and not only from him...By all means, Boycott Sochi remaining G-8 members, and stay united and firm.","The G-8 Summit, scheduled for Sochi, should be moved to another venue, another continent, perhaps.  The world leaders must show Mr. Putin that they are working together-without him-.  Pull the rug out from under him, show some courage and don't let him have his fantasy fulfilled.  Force him to acknowledge that we're in the 21st century, that behavior such as his won't be tolerated, and that he still has a long way to go to catch up with the rest of the world.  A lot of leaders have been delusional.  He is certainly one of them.",,
stasnovikov,1,,,Please do not remember this as it's patently false - Putin was never EVER  a head of the KGB (he did however work for that organization in various capacities)..Now something you should remember - G. Bush WAS a head of the CIA . Yet no one seem to make a big deal out of it while all you can hear about Putin is KGB this and KGB that.  Shall we say double standard?.Same goes for the assertion that Russian citizens are somehow manipulated just like the Soviets - the simpletons that they are - they believe whatever Putin's media is feeding them.  It's gorgeously ironic that in fact the Western citizens are being duped by the presstitutes and don't even notice it while Russians have a critical attitude to any newsmedia AND great access to any mass media.,"If Russians are the invaders, then Putin in fact should decide on the points for a ceasefire since then he would be a direct party to the conflict. And if they are not, then he cant..You seem to want to have it both ways.  You also seem to think that you know for sure what is what - deviousness shall not pass while you are on the watch!","According to you, people should trust Putin if believing him gets you the . Well, most Russians simply put their money where Putin's mouth is, so to speak - Russian GDP per person went up from 850 to 17,650 while Putin was talking. Ukrainian GDP however is another story altogether - at its best in 2010 it reached 7,450 per person, and now it's in a toilet and while it's convenient to blame Putin and Russia, no intelligent person have been able to describe exactly how it was accomplished.","Have you even ever heard Putin? How would you know he lied, or lies, or is lying?  Oh, let me guess u heard it on CNN? Read on NYT? Your neighbourboor, Sara Palin, told you so?.Please consider the source of your ignorance, for once..These are not Soviet times when only Pravda told the truth.  There is internet in Russia and plenty of media to choose from and for an average Russian, there has never been more dissonance between what  they know about PUtin and Russia and what they read in the Western press on those two subjects.",It would seem you really don't care to know who actually pressed the launch button as long as Putin is blamed for it..We read you loud and clear - you don't give a hoot about the victims - they are indeed regardless.. - it's all geopolitical blame game to you.,I always wonder how just how on earth some of the NYT readers can possibly know what Mr. Putin wants - are you psychic ?,And this fact of yours is what - an NYT article naming Putin all of those plus the supreme evil commander?,"Putin is not a circus dog to be trained to behave better  but if I were to continue pondering what you are pondering then I'd be very concerned for the safety of your dog handler - remember Zigfried sans Roy or the Seaworld orca accident?.When you treat someone like an animal, it is only fair they treat you like one, too.","Answering a question with a question is not an answer.  While I reside in NY, I am originally from the USSR.  VsB, does this help answer your question?.To Jack from IL: if you can understand Russian and watch Putin do a 2 hour Q&amp;A session with journalist instead of relying on misinterpretations you have access to (aka sticking your head in the US press sand), you might get a different impression of this tyrant  and dictator.  He is actually very reasonable, quotes a lot of legal precedents and does not ignore facts willy-nilly. Nor is he an evil incarnate as you might imagine.  By the way, the moniker ex-KGB whatever is only scary to 3 year olds and even then only until someone reminds that Mr. Bush once headed CIA and somehow it's never brought up as a bad thing.",

Katie 1,,1,,I think Putin is a loose canon with serious post Cold War payback issues! He's shrewd and can see the impotence of the west to thwart his obvious hunger games to reclaim what he believes is Russian.  As far as he is concerned pacts and treaties are made to be broken and so far his technique seems successfully prescient of things to come.,For Putin this is like throwing the baby out with the bath water except the bath water has more economic value than the baby. His economic concerns appear to override any concern for the people of the Ukraine. Any divisiveness for him is disaster because he loses his anchor and one of his core allies.,"Putin's theoretical justification though backward and reminiscent of pre Cold War politics, was based on a national identification of Russianness. He tried to brainwash the Ukrainians into believing in the myth into the collective narrative of 'one people.' Unfortunately for him, the other half of the Ukraine and the world bystanders sitting in this gladiator esque theatre didn't buy into it. When the oil price took a nose dive, it was like someone opening the doors of the lions into the arena, except the only one there to fight them was Putin. I think people ubiquitously have come to the realization that it's going to take a lot more than a sling shot to fend off the inevitable demise of Putin's reconstructed side show. Hopefully ' the west and the rest' as Mr Friedman suggests can work together to prevent yet another potential global meltdown.",Putin is just eating away at what remains of the thin fabric that separates admission from responsibility. He's laughing at anyone who can't see through his veneer of espionage and surreptitious infiltration. Why America is also consumed with the Middle East: isn't this timing almost too coincidental for Mr Putin to be encroaching on the Ukraine in this serpentine form?,"Tricky geopolitics again. Once again Putin's assistance in the still unresolved Syrian crisis should be an indication that his outward intentions but inward claims are not always in sync. The Ukraine, though militarily and economically impoverished, are united in their assertiveness for autonomy. As for the ethnic and religious divisions, they should be allowed to sort these issues out for themselves. The greatest threat to their autonomy and the trouncing of their international rights should be at the forefront of western intervention: preferably one which does not involve force.","Tricky geopolitics again.

Countries which overthrow their governments need to be seen independently of other geopolitical or economic interests. Newly formed governments if they meet the criterion for authentically democratic need  to be  deemed legitimate and should therefore be recognized and supported accordingly.",,,
Dan,,1,,"Putin is a liar who see peace talk as just a way to win time and resupply his troops. The west need to enforce hard-biting sanctions, the kind that will really hurt the russian economy.","Now Putin is the moderate one, not the Architect of War in the East. That title seems to belong to those wild and crazy separatists in places like Donetsk, not Putin..This operation is a case study in CCCP disinformation. 24 to 36 hours from now, Putin's call for restraint will be a distant memory, erased by a new tide of disinformation. It is far more than disconcerting to observe the pathetic and uniformed Western response to these tactics, which more than anything else, remind one of 1937 in Europe.","We should immediately send heavy armament to Ukraine to help it defend itself against what is more and more an open invasion and we should fight this war in the only right way possible : economically.  Very harsh sanctions should be imposed on Putin's Russia, the kind of which will make him think twice before he tries to invade any neighboring countries to fulfill his delusion of a new Russian empire.","So Putin drags Russia into the quagmire. Let it happen. We can't stop them, so roll with it. Let them project their strength, and overextend, and stumble. In the long run, they will gain nothing but a boiling cauldron of hate, just as we had after decades of effort. We don't need their oil anymore, so why concern ourselves? Let them be the target.","So Putin drags Russia into the quagmire. Let it happen. We can't stop them, so roll with it. Let them project their strength, and overextend, and stumble.

The west have to stand united and see Russia for what it has become : an hostile country in the middle of a nationalistic rise with expansionist views on its neighbors.","Yes, let's support the alleged desire of some people to live in a country where laws apply (more) equally to (almost) everyone, and the government guarantees that basic freedomsright are respected -- by punishing other innocent people who did nothing wrong, and let's do it on a whim wo pretending to have any legal justification for it.  Totally makes Putin's point that 'the West' is 100 hypocritical on the whole Ukraine situation entirely void..Jeez.","We should start to supply real weapons to Kiev, as well as increasing sanctions on Moscow and maybe even targeting Russia's access to the SWIFT interbank system if Putin continue his murderous folly.","Exactly 100 years ago, World War I began. Exactly 75 years ago, World War II began. The world is again confronted with the familiar mix of arrogance and cowardice with led to these disasters. Confronted now, Putin may retreat. Tragically, I see neither the will or courage in the West to confront his blatant aggression, which will envelope Ukraine (Novorossiya'), Lithuania, Latvia and beyond if it is not stopped HERE and NOW. In 1994, Ukraine was the third largest nuclear power in the world, with 2,500 warheads. The United States signed a treaty which guaranteed Ukraine's independence in return for allowing its nuclear deterrent (which included SS-18 missiles) to be destroyed. With the Ukraine as an example, no nation in the world is liable to ever again unilaterally disarm. That is due to Putin's insane mendacity, but also to a most tragic failure of US leadership.","Poroshenko has displayed more than enough patience in the past two weeks, enduring a de facto Russian invasion of unmarked tanks and other military equipment, suffering 27 deaths and enduring the takeover of a large part of the free press in eastern Ukraine, including TV. All that in two weeks. It is no wonder that Mr. Putin wanted to extend the ceasefire a while longer.  Ukraine's next steps are to construct a 10 km wide DMZ on its own land and apply immediately for full membership in the EU."
WoodsBeldau,,1,,"The crisis was created by Vladimir Putin well before the annexation of Crimea.  President Yanukovych is on record as committed to Ukraine joining the EU, which was expressed on multiple occasions from the time of his election in 2010.  In fact this was one of the pillars of his presidency, which Russia claims was legal. This position of Yanukovych was strongly support by the parliament with support from all regions - 318 votes out of 449 in mid 2013.  Joining the EU was one point in which the vast number of Ukrainian citizens agreed in the months and years preceding the Vilnius Summit.  Putin was able to change Yanukovych's convictions through sticks and carrots - bankrupt Ukraine and worse if goes with the EU or 15 billion loan with no requirement for reforms of any kind.  Essentially it was for Ukraine to continue as a corrupt appendage of Russia or begin the difficult path of reforms and becoming a normal country.  Millions of people took to the streets to protest a sudden decision by the government that went against the long held, very popular position of joining the EU.  If Putin had allowed Yanukovych to sign the Association agreement with the EU there would have been no demonstrations and no crisis.  The US as well as Russia are both bound by the 1994 Budapest Treaty to safeguard the territorial integrity of Ukraine which also forbid Russian economic coercion of Ukraine - the key factor that led to this crisis .",Two principal requirements - guarantee of territorial integrity and freedom from political and economic coercion. Putin's threats to essentially bankrupt Ukraine if it signed the Association agreement with the EU is an example of a violation of the 1994 Budapest memorandum.   Two reasons why corruption is rampant in Ukraine - its long legacy of Soviet domination and continued Russian economic coercion over the years with corrupt middle men making transactions work.  Russia refuses to sell Ukraine gasoline - no problem.  Middlemen buy gas from Russia and resell and pocket millions.  Repeat that for many products.,"People in Ukraine, particularly in industrialized Eastern Ukraine are impoverished, wages are very low.  Police are grossly underpaid.  But, in the years leading up to Vilnius Summit the majority of the people were for joining the EU, including President Yanukovych and the vast majority of the parliament.  There has been no modernization of industry rather the East has been treated as a colonial territory - exploited for cheap labor with no investment.  This is what the oligarchs wanted to maintain and what was in Putin's offer of continued subsidies with no reforms.  Pay former military to revolt and you will find a dozen takers in every bar. Odessa is a different matter.  It is a cosmopotalitan city, perhaps the wealthiest.  People got along.  A colleague who witnessed the incident said that a Ukrainian Unity march planned three weeks in advance and authorized by the city government began peacefully.  The sizeable demonstration was attacked by an anti-Ukrainian mob of about 250 club wielding thugs with 500 police watching who did nothing to stop them.  The peaceful demonstration responded to the attack.  Some of the anti-Ukraine group ran into the Stalin era Union building that was largely stone with little to burn.  The building is still standing most of it undamaged.  The detailed explanation that the event was an engineered provocation whose objective was to create hatred is plausible and fits a pattern of outsiders seeking to destabilize Ukraine.","A coup is a takeover of a government by a small group, often from the military, with no demonstrable popular support.  What happened in Kiev is a popular reaction by millions of people to a sudden change in government policy by its leader.  Yanukovych is on record many times for many years of calling for Ukraine to join the EU reflecting the view of the vast majority of the parliament.  This is one thing in which most of Ukraine's people agreed.  President Putin offered a last minute deal - no reforms, a nice loan, continued subsidized gas prices or Ukraine will be bankrupted with high gas prices and face reforms.  Reforms called for by the EU agreement would cut corruption and have the potential to lead to modernization of the industry cutting Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs out, but giving the people of the country more.  People of Ukraine also wanted to enjoy traveling to Europe and other benefits.  When Yanukovych accepted Putin's offer it essentially meant that Ukraine was to continue to be the corrupted appendage of Russia that it had been.  Massive numbers of people took to the streets.  This is what brought down Yanukovych and why his own party rejected him.  The parliament elected in 2012 is still in power.  There is an interim government until a new president can be elected on May 25.  If Mr. Putin wants dialogue, he should do everything in his power that the elections are free and fair and not disrupted by violence anywhere in Ukraine.","Russia has consistently violated the 1994 Budapest Agreement by apply economic coercion to Ukraine.  Russian coercion has in turn fostered corruption that was augmented by the robber baron mentality of much of Russian leadership itself.   The vast majority of the people of Ukraine, regardless of ethnic origin want to be free of corruption and to live in a normal country.  That is what the agreement with the EU was about.   Russia kept Ukraine in an icebox since the breakup of the Soviet Union.   Lenin statues were still prevalent throughout the country until the recent revolution.   Reforms were discouraged.   Now, the people of Ukraine should be able to hope that reforms will be possible and that they can finally begin to really leave the Soviet Union that they were never really permitted to leave until now.   Let Russia have the burden of Crimea even though the annexion of the territory is not being done out of any consideration for the people in Crimea.  During an extended visit to Crimea in 1994 I was told by locals that the Moscow team runs the government.   Nothing has changed in the intervening period.  Moscow ran the government than and will run it now.  Mr. Putin has chosen the extremely dangerous path of appealing to Great Russian nationalism.   Unleashing this unreasoning drive now will only further distract from Mr. Putin's prime responsibility - diversifying the economy away from oil and gas for the well being of his own people.","A decade ago Russia was on an elevator lifting it to increasing wealth for its people as it became more deeply integrated into the global economy.  Europeans and Americans want to do business with Russia.  Choices were then made by Russia to rebuild the military borrowing money from pension funds rather than to invest in research and innovation.  Russia invests barely 1 of GDP in R&amp;D and its choice further increases its dependence on outside infusions of technology diminishing the long term security of the country.  The weapons that have been purchased will become obsolete, but the overarching threats where innovation is essential will increase.  Now, it also appears that the price of oil will decrease much lower than anticipated by Russia placing its pension funds at risk that were robbed to pay for the military.   There was zero perceived risk from NATO, otherwise the annexation of Crimea and the destabilization of Ukraine would never have been initiated.   Mr. Putin referred to the invasion of Iraq as a strategic error but fails to recognize that his own actions are a comparable blunder with major negative consequences for Russia and for the international community.   In late 2012 Putin was seen as a global statesmen providing solutions to problems such as chemical weapons in Syria.  He is an opportunist.  He could still play such a role and no doubt be lauded by Tom Friedman.",There was zero threat from NATO to Russian interests in Ukraine.   It is very highly unlikely that the parliament of Ukraine would have voted to seek membership in NATO if there had not been aggression by Russia first.   A country whose very existance is threatened by a hostile neighbor will seek help.  You should read the minutes from NATO summits.   NATO did not even have a defensive doctrine against Russia until Russia's recent actions made it necessary.   NATO's unreadiness to defend its members in Europe appears to have been a part of the calculations of Russian leadership.  Would Putin have taken the significant risks in Ukraine if he had expected significant resistance from Ukraine or the EU or the US?   He expected no resistance so he acted.,The only way NATO was a consideration in the early stages of this conflict was that Putin was aware that NATO had no defensive doctrine against Russian aggression in Europe.  NATO could do nothing so Putin felt free to seize Crimea and to destabilize Ukraine.  The analogy to the Cuban missile crisis does not hold.  Russia participated in NATO summits and was aware of NATO plans to a significant degree.  There was zero desire for NATO expansion to Ukraine.,"Perhaps Germany and France were motivated by the rising violence in Eastern Ukraine, but this does not appear to be an important factor for Putin where the death of nearly 6,000 appears to be of no consequence.  He negotiates the design of a ceasefire process that delays the ceasefire to encourage fighting in the interim.  Apparently his calculations were that Russian-led forces in the region had a good chance of seizing more territory before the start of the ceasefire to mark a new line of demarcation.","Responsible rebel leaders would work so that the views that they hold could still be a factor after peace is restored in Donetsk.  That means that they would negotiate so people representing their views can run in the local elections that will come.   But, to stand and fight would be a grave disservice to the people of Donetsk.  Most want peace not war.  But Mr. Strelkov lives in an illusory world and does not give a damn about the people of Donetsk.  Only the vision of a greater Russia matters to him.  Mr. Putin should briddle the GRU where Strelkov is ranked as a colonel and if Strelkov fails to heed direct orders to go home Mr. Putin should send a bounty hunter to get colonel Strelkov and stop the destruction of Donetsk.   The government of Ukraine is committed to meet the needs of the people of Donetsk.  President Poroshenko should be given a chance to reverse decades of neglect - to attract investment, create jobs, reform the police, improve medical care, etc."

Jose Pardinas,1,,,"Neocon protestations and requiems like Mr. Cohen's notwithstanding, Putin will not allow an ethnic Russian population to be crushed by a military organized and funded by Washington.

The latter one of the world's great nuclear powers, fully capable putting an end to Western civilization, if not humanity as we know it. ..The road to stability in Ukraine is now clear: Russia will have to inflict as definitive a crushing blow to the American-backed forces out of Kiev as it did to those organized by Washington in Georgia years ago.

The chickens will also undoubtedly come home to roost over what Washington is trying to do in Syria now.","Whenever Putin and Lavrov face the press, they always emphasize how a population (any population) should not be crushed militarily into political submission...Their point of view is in stark contrast with the key tenet of American foreign  which stresses imposing itself by force on others around the world. ..This is why Putin is so admired  that is, other than in the Western free press.",Russina history informs Russian opinion. ..Which explains Putin's popularity. The Russians can smell encirclement and dismemberment coming a mile away. ..The West (i.e. Washington) wants to start by turning the ethnic Russians in East Ukraine into a militarily-conquered and oppressed population - the Slavic counterpart of the Palestinians.  ..The rest of the plan is pretty obvious.,I believe Putin is a political genius...And he's doing what he's doing for the good of his people. His reputation and legacy rest on what happens to the ethnic Russians in East Ukraine...He will go down in infamy if he allows the West to bludgeon them militarily into submission. If he allows them to be turned into an occupied and oppressed Slavic version of the Palestinians.,"That's where Putin will need to show that he can be measured. ..Being a smart cookie, he'll insist the new Ukrainian government (whichever one the USA and EU finally install) constitutionally guarantees the physical safety and civil rights of ethnic Russians in the East, including the right to use Russian, their native tongue. That population will provide Putin with lasting political leverage in Ukraine. ..And the West will have to comply.

Beantownah,1,,,"Whose fault is Syria? Advantage Putin in this debate. At the start of the Syrian protests Obama tried to meddle from the sidelines for idealistic reasons - Arab Spring! - but he and his advisers lost the forest from the trees. The Libyan example cited by Putin is telling - the US encourages revolt, then quietly walks away as chaos spreads, hewing to a noninterventionist path. Putin's skill set -old school power politics - is Obama's blind spot. Obama uses appeals to reason. Putin uses tanks and fighter planes. That is a battle for regional influence whose lopsided outcome is, sadly, preordained.","Not a positive development, and it will undoubtedly be characterized by Putin as a provocation and then who knows what comes next from him. But it is the least worst option in a world where increasingly that is what the US is faced with. Continuing to do nothing but send a few hundred troops every month or so for a tepid display of unity during joint exercises with our Baltic and Eastern European partners was not a reassuring display of American solidarity. This is more the sort of boots (or tanks) on the ground commitment our allies had been almost begging for from Obama, who increasingly was thought to be hopelessly equivocal and pusillanimous by many European leaders. Though his pacifist isolationism is totally in keeping with the electorate's current zeitgeist, as with ISIS, Putin's actions have now forced him to act beyond his comfort zone. Hopefully this move will deter our enemies and reassure our friends, but recent history shows it probably won't achieve either end.","Another example of the hyper-rationalist approach of Obama foreign policy being the square peg that doesn't fit in the round hole of the irrationally-driven dynamics of geopolitics. By all reason, after a year of punishing sanctions, Putin should have surrendered his grip on the Ukraine, apologized to everyone, and begged for the sanctions to have been lifted. That hasn't happened, the conflict has worsened, and now our European allies are feeling lucky to have left this latest parlay with (another) face-saving cease fire (soon to be broken again). Putin uses guns and bombs. We use words. Though we are pursuing a morally and logically superior approach, guess who wins a guns versus words conflict? In Athens vs. Sparta, Sparta wins.","Mr. Putin has played his dangerous game in Ukraine with cunning and deceit....No he hasn't. He laid his cards on the table from the get-go, using his KGB analytical training to calculate that neither the US nor NATO would dare stop him militarily. He rightly concluded that sanctions, unlike an armed counterattack, can be dealt with later.  And he has been ahead of the curve in concluding long ago that this is not a dangerous game for him to play, where his only serious military adversary, as confirmed yesterday, will not intervene with armed force under any circumstances and has written off Ukraine as not its war and not its problem.","An accord reached in Geneva last week, when all sides seemed to agree on the need to defuse the confrontation over cities seized by armed, pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, is continuing to crumble. Isn't this the same accord the Times and Kerry just hailed as such a success? At least Obama had the presence of mind to sound a note of caution about it. But that in turn begs the question of why bother pouring so much time and energy into brokering a deal Putin never intended to abide by and Obama didn't think would work?","Mr. Putin's dangerous tactics are sure to backfire? And how exactly? As I write this Mr. Putin is announcing he intends to take military control of the Crimea. He cares not a whit what Obama or Kerry or NATO says or does, and why should he? The US under Obama will not - will never - use significant military force abroad. Putin is a classic old school Russian strong man, who only cares about how many divisions the Pope has. If you deal with Putin on the basis of we won't use force, but would you mind having a reasonable discussion about our differences? he will brush you aside and do whatever he wants. While in the case of the Crimea and Ukraine doing nothing may actually be the right move for the US, Obama and Kerry make doing nothing worse than it would be by continuing their pattern of issuing hollow threats. Their seemingly congenital inability to stop drawing meaningless red lines further damages our credibility with our allies and perhaps more dangerously, our foes.",,,,

CityBumpkin,,1,,"Yanukovich IS the Russian-backed President - as in, the Russian government has openly stated their support for him. Russia makes no secret of that. They play host to Yanukovich and, until his usefulness ran out now, has demanded that he be re-instated. ..You may have missed the fine print. Putin's offer of disengagement is conditional. Read the article. He has offered to recognize the Ukranian election only if the Ukranian government grants political autonomy for the East.","Strangely, Putin might prefer this kind of diplomacy. He's an old school Cold War era apparatchik. This might even be comforting.","I see the JudyW, Putin's Deputy Minister of Propaganda for the NYT Comment Board is doing her rounds on a comment by comment basis today. ..Dave is correct. Russia's aggressive posture only feeds the Ukrainian ultra-nationalist fringe. As happened so many times in history, extremists on opposite ends are the ones who profit the most from any confrontation. ..However, unlike Putin, the Ukrainian government continuously avoid confrontation, giving lie to Russian claims of oppression against ethnic Russians. Even JudyW admitted a couple of comments above that police departments are surrendering their arsenals to pro-Russian protestors.","I personally think Putin is a despicable pseudo-dictator, but he has an admirable grasp of international politics. He is offering to step back from the confrontation, IF Ukraine agrees to political autonomy for the East. That means putting the East within the Russian sphere of influence. Will the EU and the Ukrainian government really say no and risk a shooting war with Russia, when Putin is giving them a chance to save face? Putin achieves his policy goal without the risks and costs of war, all the while getting to pretend to be the peace-maker...Too bad our recent crop of American politicians don't have half of Putin's savvy. Just look at Iraq falling into Iran's orbit, after a decade of wasted American lives and treasure. Putin knows you never pay for what you can get for free. Our leaders are all about over-paying for the pie in the sky.","I'm fascinated by the Ukranian President was overthrown internet meme. I just went through a number of sources - wikipedia, various major news outlets, etc. - and could not fathom where this meme came from. Yanukovich had the army and police on his side. The dissidents in Kiev were essentially besieged. Yet suddenly, this besieged rabble in Kiev magically defeated the police and the army and threw Yanukovich out of the country? ..The problem for Yanukovich was that he lost political support with his heavy handed tactics. The Ukranian Parliament, elected in 2012, voted to remove Yanukovich because of his heavy-handed bumbling. Even Yanukovich's own Party of Regions saw Yanukovich's heavy-handed tactics was driving matters way out of hand and disowned him. ..Yet somehow, Putin apologists are now stating the Yanukovich was some innocent martyr overthrown in an US-backed armed coup. Now people just repeat this as the truth. I guess that's the true wonder of the internet - if you repeat anything often enough.","Actually, I believe the prospect of an unfriendly government in Kiev was what prompted the invasion in the first place. The Crimea serves as Russia's main naval base in the Black Sea, which has security implications in the oil-producing but unstable Caucasus. Russia has leased its naval base in Sevastapol from a Ukranian government since the break up of the Soviet Union. But with a NATOEU-friendly government in power in Kiev, Putin could not be certain the lease treaty would be honored.","Why are so many people gloating about this? It is pretty hypocritical to be so outraged about US actions in Iraq, while rubbing your hands in glee as Russia annexes Crimea. Putin's many pretexts are as hollow as the Bush Administration's justification to invade Iraq. I have no doubt the referendum is pure farce. Have you ever been in a democratic country? When was the last time 94 of a real democratic country agreed on anything? That number alone should call the legitimacy of the referendum into question...Why should Ukranians (and Crimean ethnic minorities) pay so you get the thrill of watching Putin spit in Obama's eye?..If you are a truly principled person, you should no more applaud Russian aggression than you do American aggression.","I see the Putin fan club refuses to be put off by this. ..Putin is not striking ISIS because Putin's goal is not to defeat ISIS. Putin's goal is to help Al Assad regain control of Syria. Fighting ISIS would only be a means to that end, and the US has been obliging enough to take care of ISIS for Putin and Assad, freeing up Russian forces to attack Assad's other opponents. ..Americans should get a clue. The Russians are not in Syria to help the US fight ISIS. It's the other way around.","I see the Putin fan club refuses to be put off by this. ..Putin is not striking ISIS because Putin's goal is not to defeat ISIS.

It is no secret Russia is arming the Eastern Ukrainian separatists, and most likely providing troops (even if you are a skeptic, you have to come to terms with the simple fact that weapons, ammunition, and supplies do not materialize out of thin air for militia groups.) ..There is no question that Russia is interfering in the internal affairs. Putin openly insists that Ukraine adopt certain internal changes to satisfy him. Yet, all this 19th Century-style Great Power entitlement seems to be accepted, and even approved of. ..There is no condemnation of Russia arming the militia group and keep the civil war going. Yet, when the US even contemplates the possibility to providing arms to the Ukrainian government, there is moral outrage all around? ..It seems like American exceptionalism has been replaced with Russian exceptionalism, with the effect that former subjects of the Russian Empire is forced back into her embrace."
Steve M,1,,,"Astonishing jingoism and demonization of Pres. Putin from Mr. Cohen!  Full of the cliches of propaganda:  force is the only thing Putin understands, Putin is Hitler (reference to 1936 olympics), the domino theory (after Crimea, then the Baltic States, then Poland, then Greece, then France, Britain stands alone)!  Maybe Russia has some legitimate concerns about encirclement.  Does anyone really believe that those American missiles in Poland are for defense against Iran?  All those American airstrikes and drone attacks in Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan are demonstrations of military violence close to Russian interests and close to its southern borders.  Maybe if the US would stand down from violence in that part of the world Russia wouldn't feel a need to remind everyone that they have thousands of nuclear weapons.","This editorial and many of the comments are rife with Russophobia.  Last year's annexation of Crimea and the battles in eastern Ukraine followed the overthrow of Ukraine's government by what appeared to be a mob intent, in part, on allying Kiev with NATO specifically in opposition to Russia.  The Russian response was, if not laudable, understandable.  The annexation of Crimea has been completely peaceful and is approved by referendum of the population.  It was the new Kiev government that started the heavy fighting in the predominantly ethnically Russian east.  ..The rhetoric of invasion and aggression and threat seems overblown.  The amateur psychological characterization andor demonization of Pres. Putin by many commenters seem ill-founded...The complaints about Russian military maneuvers leave me scratching my head.  For example: Mr. Putin has crossed other lines, including sending military aircraft unannounced into international airspace over Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and the North Sea.   Are military flights in international airspace supposed to be announced?  How can airspace over Estonia, Lithuania, Latavia, and Poland be international?  ..And who are we to complain about military aggressions anyway?  And how hypocritical is it for us to complain about another country's nationalism?  This editorial seems to be inspired by the doctrine of American Exceptionalism.","Putin should remember the old adage you break it you bought it.

In particular, he writes, it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger should emerge capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America's global pre-eminence.

Robert McConnell,,,1,"Don't be so sure on the sanctions being counterproductive.  Sanctions take time to have significant impact.  Clearly the Russian economy is suffering and that means the people are suffering.  Over the past 20-odd years the people of Russia have experience modest improvement in the quality of life, the sanctions will likely reduce that level of improvement.  The people also began to enjoy multiple sources of independent news from the outside, Putin is rapidly reigning that in.  In other words, in the past two years since Putin resumed power (absolute power) the situation for the average Russian citizen has deteriorated, is continuing to deteriorate, and if we ratchet up the sanctions, will deteriorate much further.  There are limits to what an elected official can impose upon his people.  Putin may well be approaching those limits.  If so, what happens within Russia may be the most interesting global event on our TV's in the not-so-distant future.",,,,,,,,,

Kevin J,,1,,"Killroy, you are mostly correct.  Putin is entirely to blame for this and all the other carnage in Ukraine.  However, it is not just that he is arming seperatists.  The fact is that the tens of thousands of Russian soldiers who illegally invaded and stole Crimea were in fact Russian soldiers, even though Putin lied about it for months claiming they were local seperatists before he finally admitted that they were Russian soldiers under the command and direction of Moscow.  Putin has sent thousands of propagandists Agents Provocoteurs from Moscow into Ukraine to sow discord and foment unrest.  Then Putin sent thousands of Russian Special Forces and Chechniyan mercenairies to launch the attempted overthrow of the Ukraine Government.  Those Russian Special Foces and mercenaries have recruited local Ukrainians to join them, often paying them to do so according to some reports, but the main source of the bloodshed is casued by the Russians that are commanded by Russian officers and directed from Moscow.  There have been several phone calls between Russian officers on the gorund in Eastern Ukraine recieving orders from higher-ups in Moscow.  There are reports of one such call earlier this morning from a Russian soldier in Ukraine confirming to a Russian Colonel in Russia that indeed WE shot down the Malaysian airliner.  That call from today has not been verified by reliable sources, but it is very consistent with other such calls in the recent past.","It has been clear for months now that Putin's Russia is a State Sponsor of Terrorism, and should be slapped with the same kinds of sanctions that are on Iran and North Korea or that would be placed upon any other State Sponsor of Terrorism.  The only thing that has changed is that now the victims of Putin's terrorism are citizens from several Western European and Asian nations, not just Ukrainians.","Sorry, but you are wrong Sonny.  Way back in 1960 the old USSR shot down a U2 flight that was flying more than twice as high, and nearly 3 times as fast as this MH aircraft.  In the last 5 decades, anti-aircraft missiles have advanced in capabilities.  The Russian made missiles that are believed to have shot down this MH aircraft are a 30 year old technology that is very capable of downing aircraft at more than twice the altitude of this MH flight.  Moreover, this missile system is well known to have been illegally smuggled across the border from Russian into Eastern Ukraine.  Whether it was so called seperatists or Russian soldiers or Russian mercenaries that actually fired the missiles, is not clear.  Either way, Putin is directly or indirectly responsible.","Unfortunately, the peaople on the ground, in this case are the same ones who shot down the aircraft, and they work for Putin's Russia.  So there is very very little chance that anyone other than the Russian Special Forces inside Eastern Ukraine, or their paid mercenaries, of the disgruntled Ukrainians working for the Russians will have access to the crash site before the Russians take everything of any value.","When the Russians shot down a Korean passenger airliner in 1983, Reagan responded with economic sanctions.  What would you warmongers have President Obama do?  Declare WAR on Russia, and send hundreds of thousands of Americans to their deaths?  In the long run, NATO would probably win a war against Putin's Russia, but in reality, no one can ever really win such a war.  Hundreds of thousands would die.  Maybe even millions.  How is that good for America, or Ukriane, or anyone else?","As very sad as this tragedy is, maybe it will finally focus the World and EU attention to the terrorist WAR that Putin's regime has been waging in Ukraine since February. Igor Girkin, the Russian Officer in command of the Russian fighter inside Ukraine, is the one who bragged about shooting down the MA 17 aircraft before it was known to be a civilian passenger plane, rather than a Ukraine cargo plane.  And the Russian commander of the unit that launched the missile, Igor Bezler, another GRU officer from Moscow, was recorded reporting to his superior officer in Russia that indeed his men were the ones that shot down MA 17.  I have family and friends in Ukraine that have been suffering under Russian Sponsored Terror attacks for months..I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the victims of MA 17.  However, if any good can come out of such a tragic and senseless act of TERRORISM, perhaps it will focus the World and the EU on Putin's terrorist WAR since it is no longer just Ukrainians that Putin is murdering.","Ukraine is a vast country.  There were already advisories to avoid the area around the Black Sea and Crimea.  That cut off any possibility of flying South to go around Eastern Ukraine.  The main area of conflict in Eastern Ukraine is North of the flight path.  So what option would you have suggested?  Also, there were dozens of other comemrcial flights through this same flight path in recent weeks without incident.  MA 17 itself had flown this same flight path numerous times in recent past.  ..Do not blame the victim.  The ONLY blame belongs firmly on the head of Putin and the terrorist fighters waging a terrorist WAR in Ukraine that he is Sponsoring.","First, the more southerly routes across the Black Sea and Crimea have been closed to commercial traffic already, so there are few options for routes.  Ukraine is a vast country, and the route of MA 17 is both north of the closed routes near Crimea, and south of the main conflict areas in Eastern Urkaine..Also, on the day of the terorist attack, there were other commercial airlines near the same route as MA 17, and dozens of ther commercial jets had flown that route in the recent past.  In fact, MA 17 had flown that same route numerous times in the recent past...Do NOT blame the victims who were murdered in this TERRORIST ATTACK..ALL the blame belongs squarely on the head of Putin and the TERRORISTS inside Ukraine that the Putin regime has Spononsored.","Why does the media keep refering to these fighters in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea as seperatists or rebels?  Clearly this is an invassion of the sovereign territory of Ukraine by Russian Special Forces and paid mercenaries. After months of lying about it, claiming that local Ukraine seperatists siezed Crimea, Putin finally admitted in late April that it was Russian Special Foces soldiers that carried out the illegal invassion and violent coup d' etat of Crimea.  Alexander Borodai, the Russian citizen and FSB officer who runs a far right-wing neo-fascist newspaper in Moscow, was one of those Russian officers that took part in Russia's illegal invassion of Crimea. Now Borodai is in Eastern Ukraine and has declared himself the Prime Minister of the illegal Donetsk People's Republic.  The local commander on the ground whose team fired the missile that downed the MH aircraft, Igor Bezler, is also a Russian officer of the GRU.  He is a Russian citizen who supposedly retired from the GRU several years ago, but there is extensive evidence that he has participated in numerous covert operations on behalf of the GRU, and in February 2014 he was sent by the GRU to assist with the Russian invassion of Crimea. Now he is Eastern Ukraine.  There are similar stories regarding Igor Girkin, another Russian officer in Eastern Ukraine, as well as thousands of other Russians and Chechin mercenaries in Eastern Ukraine, who are all paid, armed, and directed by Putin's regime in Moscow.","Just how many German citizens, and other Europeans, have to be murdered by the TERRORISTS Sponsored by and armed by Putin's regime, before Angela Merkel chooses to put the lives of human beings, and German citizens, above her businesses dealings with Putin?"
Anna G,1,,,"No, from the beginning of the conflict, Putin was saying that it is the conflict within Ukraine. The Ukraine government, although an illegal one, should address the demands of the East Ukraine population, which the present government refused to do.

The present government now presents the interests of the  12 of the population. There are no representatives from the eastern part.. It is a fact that Ukraine army now is fighting the Ukrainians of East Ukraine. East Ukraine defends its own land and their rights. And if Poroshenko really wants piece, he should take the army out from the territory of East Ukraine and start a dialog.","Finally, Kerry and the EU listen to Lavrov, it is his ideas from the beginning, only now been heard..You should see reports by Reuters, there are no Russians (citizen of Russia) in Donetsk, Luhansk and other cities.  And Russia has the right to have the troops at the boarder given the situation. ..The USA media should stop demonizing Putin and Russia; it is already too much.  Media should educate people, not tell lies. Russia does not threaten to any countries.  Crimea is too a delicate thing, it was a historical mistake, look at the people there, they are happy, it is their choice, and Americans are just misinformed. Russian and Ukraine people will not fight each other; they have thousand years of history. The USA is an infant historically. Russia wants independent Ukraine, not divided, but federal organization is unavoidable, it is clear. Putin said it many times.....Before teaching others, NATO should move back to the Germany boarders as it was agreed in 1990. The USA should mind its own business, not interfere in the other people affairs and not fight their market wars of gas EU should decide what is best for them.The legal government of Ukraine (not this one that is illegal) will address the issues of multi ethnicity and it will mean federation. Others should not interfere...The war drums are heard only from the western side Calm down. Nobody wants the war there. Maybe somebody wants here? This is the question.

Daniel Yakoubian,1,,,"With all due respect, a big part of the problem I think is reflected in your comment - being dismissive of Putin as well as the rebels, as if their interests aren't a factor, while those of Europe and the US are paramount.  With this kind of attitude, the conflict will never be resolved because the whole discussion is one sided.","This article should not be taken out of context but considered in light of what Putin and Russia have been saying for years about NATO and western encroachment on its borders and related areas of significant security concern - security clearly including military and economic threats.  The article in no way supports a conclusion that Russia was going to annex Crimea no matter what - it appears consistent with Russia's position that it requires both military and economic cooperation with bordering states.  What the article does illustrate is the realistic assessment by Russia of the political situation in Ukraine under Yanukovych and its equally prescient anticipation of political instability and pro-western tendencies threatening its influence especially in areas historically, ethnically and culturally connected with Russia.  Quite distressing to read comments and commentary that dismiss Russia's interests and constantly impute aggressive aggrandizement as opposed to a defensive strategy.  But then the US and the West have a very strong record of applying a double standard - what is OK for them is not for those who are not in their camp.  This approach can only, I repeat can only provoke retaliation.",,,,,,,,

Whatever your beliefs regarding the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, certainly the Taliban were ultimately beneficiaries of our training &amp; arming Mujahideen (though not all became Taliban)...I'm sure Putin has plenty of nasty characteristics, but concern over the expansion of ISIS is not overly paranoid: Chechnya. In 2004, 1,100, mostly children &amp; women, were taken hostage at a SCHOOL in Beslan. 385 people were killed. Sandy Hook lite.

Misha lived and worked with Brian Eno and appeared on his Music For Films III album.  He told me they used to watch Jeeves and Wooster. He was in Sudden Owl (Psyche) and The Fantom.  He apparently got a little too immersed in Carlos Castaneda stuff, but that boy could play a mean Theremin and E-MU Emulator.  I've read that Eno bailed him out of the clink, though sadly Misha died soon after. ..

In the cartoon, a burly Stalin (Russia) grabs a very slender woman (Finland), and brandishes a bullwhip, shouting Ha- caught you trying to attack me!

I recollect a similar dialog between Hitler and Churchill some years ago: Give us a free hand in Europe, proposed Hitler, and we'll stop terror-bombing your cities. Such a deal, but Churchill wasn't having any of it. Hamburg, Dresden and Cologne got flattened along the way. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlins press secretary, said separately that Russia could not negotiate a cease-fire because it was not a party to the conflict, but that the opinions of the two presidents overlapped.

There are always lots of reasons for good people to do nothing. But let's not pretend that Putin is coming to the aid of the poor oppressed Russians in the Crimea. That stupid we're not.","The author states, We did not seek this confrontation. This new era crept up on us, because we did not fully win the Cold War. What does fully winning the Cold War mean? That Russia was encircled by barbed wire, or nuked into a smoking ash heap? Or that we turned Russia into a democracy? Obviously not. In any event, we (the West) didn't win the Cold War at all; the Soviet Union lost it. Trying to keep up with Western arms expenditures, it spent itself into oblivion, ruined its economy and came apart at the seams. Putin's latest adventure into Crimea is the strategic military equivalent of the dead cat bounce. Putin can't provoke a major shooting war anywhere else because he will lose, much as those before him would have lost, had they ever tried. His only game with potential staying power is economic blackmail. European countries, if they were truly serious about their freedom, would not waste their time stockpiling more weapons, but becoming less dependent on Russian oil.","Ah, yes. Putin the Great Peacemaker. Who can forget the yeoman-like work he did in Syria? Certainly not the NYT, which gave him an op-ed page all his own, the better to lecture the rest of us on his advanced state of enlightenment. Putin snapped his fingers and President Assad agreed in a heartbeat to rid himself of chemical weapons he denied ever having. I forget; did Putin win the Nobel Peace Prize for that? But I digress. Why is it that investigators can't get to the crash site? Surely if Putin wanted them in there, the sooner the better, he'd snap his fingers at the armed thugs in eastern Ukraine, and they'd all bark in unison. So........there is only one conclusion to be drawn. Putin doesn't want any investigators near the crash site who he doesn't control, because his fingerprints are all over this tragedy. Don't engrave his name on the Nobel medal just yet.","Well, that should get Putin's attention, while of course not fueling his self-induced paranoia about the West and what it's always up to. He'll be forced to pull his troops out of Crimea now! If only the Berlin Olympics were to have been held in 1940- we could have avoided WW II by moving them to.....Brussels. Oh wait, The Germans took Belgium in 24 hours anyway.","One hundred years after the start of World War I, military force should never again become the means of conducting politics. Such a civilized and uplifting sentiment! Clearly Putin doesn't believe any such thing, as his soldiers overrun the Crimea. If Merkel does, that means Ukraine's short time in the sun as an independent country is over. She may speak the same language as Putin, but she's no match for him. But of course the Ukraine will be Putin's last territorial ambition in Europe. Why is that phrase so familiar?","I doubt that Roosevelt or Truman enjoyed Stalin's company. And they were nominally allies! There is no reason for Obama to like or placate Putin, either. Putin waltzed into Ukraine, and he can waltz right back out if he misses his Western buddies. I'm tired of the whining over poor, misunderstood Russia and its legitimate fears of encirclement. The Nazi threat to Russia ended 69 years ago, and 66 years ago, we began the Berlin Airlift to feed German civilians the Soviet Union was still trying to starve. After the war, the US brought its soldiers home. But Russia stayed, with an occupation of Eastern Europe as brutal as the Nazis, lasting for decades, not years. Present-day Europe's palpable lack of good will towards Russia is the legacy of those years of inexcusable and savage repression, although I suspect that's not how it's taught in Soviet history books. Russia fought first for its own survival, but then to enslave everything beyond its borders. We fought to free other countries from Nazi rule. Putin doesn't even belong in Normandy today.","My, Grandmother, what large trucks you have! All those Russian heavy transport planes sitting on the ground, because Putin can't trust his separatist flunkies not to shoot them down. So he has to use trucks- how quaint. Anyone ever seen a Red Cross convoy like this anywhere, anytime? If it's really chock full of humanitarian aid, surely there will be no objection to each truck's contents being verified before crossing the border. I don't suppose that the truck drivers, members of the Russian military, will be looking out the windows, scouting out Ukrainian positions or otherwise gathering intelligence, because that would be wrong. Maybe a useful deal could be worked out, though- for each truckload of evidence removed from the Malaysian Airlines crash site which is returned, Ukraine will allow one humanitarian truck to enter.","Quick: Obama resign, appoint Hillary! She'll know what to do! She can ask Biden to step down and then appoint McCain as her VP- together, they'll know what to do! Hint: it involves force and sending other peoples' children into harm's way. It should only last 10-15 years, and bring the nuclear superpowers into a direct shooting war for the first time, ever. Putin can fire on American soldiers with helicopters launched from his new French warships. NATO will stay safe in Brussels, sipping wine and eating chocolate, all the while urging restraint on both sides, just to seem fair. What could go wrong? OR, we could acknowledge the obvious military reality that we can no more keep Russia out of Ukraine than the Russians can keep us out of the Baja Peninsula. So, if we really care, we can send all Russian nationals home, freeze all Russian assets in the US, cease all trading, and start selling our excess domestic oil production to Europe. We spent Russia into oblivion 20 years ago. We can do it again. In the meantime, let's see if the Russians fare any better in Ukraine than they did in Afghanistan."
Simon Sez,1,,,"Putin is saying what every single Russian person ( ethnic and linguistic) knows...Crimea is Russia...It always has been. It is deeply bound up with the history and destiny of Russia...The fact that some people display such profound ignorance of Russian history and culture to dispute this is not Russia's problem...Kharkhov, Odessa, Donetsk also have majority Russian-speaking populations...There is no rational reason why they, too, should not have referendums so that they can indicate their desire to either remain part of what is euphemistically called Ukraine or to have a much different future with Russia...Most Americans are profoundly ignorant regarding these matters with our president and his advisors leading the pack. ..This is too bad since it will only create more unnecessary problems.","One thing that has really struck me on reading US and EU (more US) government statements, columnists in US media, and looking at comments in the US media, especially the NYT, is just how alien Russia and the worldview of the Russian culture and people is to many people...Like any group they are not monolithic. There are many diverse elements. However, lack of understanding of Russian history, attitudes, language ( I speak fluent Russian) and culture is not an asset in understanding Putin's behavior and that of his people...The other day the NYT had an excellent article on the dearth of training in the US in Russian studies. This is a tragedy since it effectively means the policy makers are simply projecting their own cultural biases on the Russians. This will often result in astounding misunderstanding...Even the most basic things like how fingers are used in counting is totally different from what we do here in the US. And it only increases in complexity from there...Articles like this one display an embarrassing ignorance of Russia and its people. ..It is never black and white.","Putin doesn't need Ukraine to show who is in charge in the region...He also doesn't need Crimea but he will hold onto it just to make his point...What is his point?..Unlike your many columnists, experts and others, I do not claim to be able to read his mind. I am not even sure he has a very specific point in mind...However, he does know that Russia will be taken seriously by the world and he has proven it just by this tiny action...Russian nationalism is a potent force. To this day every Russian family knows of the personal sacrifices made, more than any other European state, during WW2, fighting the Germans who almost got to the gates of Moscow...And Russia will not capitulate to the sons of those Ukrainians who fought for the Nazis and their nationalist descendents who made this coup d'etat...Russia already has a separate gas pipeline that goes through Germany which, ironically, will rescue Russia in all of this. Putin will do whatever he has to do to show that Russia will not ever be pushed around by its enemies...Putin's only fluent foreign language is German. He knows the Germans well. He knows that Merkel and he are on the same page...Obama is ignorant of so many things especially what drives Russians and Germans...His empty threats have left him with zero credibility...It is a wonder that anyone even returns his calls.","What Putin has done is understandable and eminently praiseworthy if you understand the situation from the standpoint of many Ukrainians of Russian heritage ( some of whom also hold Russian passports) as well as the Russians...As has been said many times including in the pages of the NYT, Eastern and Southern Ukraine, where Yanukovich won big during the election ( yes, he is a liar, crook and pathetic man but maybe we can relate with some of our politicos) are predominantly Russian speaking. They voted for what is still the majority party, The Party of Regions. ..The people on Maidan square in Kiev are not those who seized power. A coup d'etat happened; some right-wing nationalists took over, threw out Yanukovitch, his Party of Regions, and, first thing, issued a law annulling the use of Russian ( spoken by 25 of Ukrainians) as an official language. This sent an immediate message; you are not welcome in our new Ukraine. ..Putin has come to the aid of Russians in Ukraine. This is his duty and he is fulfilling it. I hope and pray that he takes as much territory in Eastern and Southern Ukraine ( Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, etc.) before the so-called nationalists can stop him. Not all but most ethnic Russians will forever be beholden to him from saving their lives...The US would not hesitate for one second to similarly respond, as many have pointed out, if a similar coup of unelected (  we have even deposed elected leaders) partisans would happen on our borders.","I wrote a comment in which I pointed out that Israel will soon  join Russia as a supplier of gas...Some people find this hard to believe but that doesn't mean it is not so...Slate recently had a good article on this which anyone may read..<a hrefhttp:www.slate.comarticlesnewsandpoliticsmoment201402israelsnaturalgasdepositstelavivsoffshoregasfieldswillmakeit.single.html titlehttp:www.slate.comarticlesnewsandpoliticsmoment201402israelsnaturalgasdepositstelavivsoffshoregasfieldswillmakeit.single.html targetblank>http:www.slate.comarticlesnewsandpoliticsmoment201402israels...<a>..My point is simple. ..Russia seems to be in a position of power when it comes to gas supply. However, there are other, lesser known contenders, who are ready and willing to supply Europe's gas needs...There are several major gas fields which will soon be producing more gas for Israel than the country could ever use for many years to come. Others to come...Gazprom, mentioned in your article, attempted to buy the rights to the fields. Israel denied them this. Israel does not consider Russia a trustworthy partner for much of anything. It is also mindful of Putin's support of the Syrian dictatorship and selling weapons to Iran...Nobel Energy has invested much of its funds in these Israeli fields. This firm also resold some of its rights to a company in Australia...There are also fields off the shore of Cyprus with which Israel has good relations. A possible pipeline may travel via Cyprus to deliver gas to Europe. ..The Palestinian Authority and Jordan have already entered into negotiations to buy gas from this source...This changes everything.","Putin doesn't need Ukraine to show who is in charge in the region...He also doesn't need Crimea but he will hold onto it just to make his point...What is his point?..Unlike your many columnists, experts and others, I do not claim to be able to read his mind.

GG,1,,,The U.S. is trying hard to demonize Putin but developments in and around Ukraine have not divided but rather united the Russian society. Traditional Putin critics inside the country continue to disagree with him on key domestic issues like human rights and freedom of the press  but criticism of Russias Ukrainian policies is hard to spot  even in the opposition media...Ukraine for Russians is the original motherland. Russian culture and the Russian language were born there. It is unthinkable for a Russian to raise a gun against his Ukrainian brother. And vice versa. Remember those numerous reports about  local policemen in the East who rather sided with protesters than fulfilled orders to fire?..Food for thought,,,,,,,,,

MJR,,1,,"Only the mass media still subscribes to Putin's narrative of referring to the thugs taking over government offices in eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian nationalists.  It has been obvious that the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine began over a month ago, when Russian special forces and security operatives arrived there by the busload as tourists. After the Russian anschluss of Crimea, Phase II of Putin's reconquest of Ukraine began.  Nobody's fooled, but the fig leaf is still in place so that we in the West can avoid further embarrassment and inconvenience over Putin's naked display of fascist aggression...Seeing the Ukrainian delegate at the U.N. pleading for his country's life reminded me of Haile Selassie before the League of Nations, as his country was being swallowed by Mussolini's Italy.","European Tea Party movements share the same sentiments as their American brethren: religious fanaticism, racism, love of Putin and hatred of the American government.","From what I can see, Putin is is like George W.

To most Russians, this is the only lever that they have that can move the world, and they will not give it up...Putin and his crony oligarchs are not much different in their methods than the Czar and his archdukes.

Henry,,1,,"It would be nice to believe our own government in all this but pictures can be doctored, of course, and who is saying what to a stray woman in eastern Ukraine hardly seems conclusive.  Certainly equipment could have been bought in the area as well.  Would I contemplate nuclear war over these details?  Don't think so.  And at the end of the day the people in the Indian Ocean are dead, ping or not, and of Putin wants eastern Ukraine he will take it and because of oil and gas no one will make much fuss at all.

The message to Putin being that we have better Military Assets than you do ... and  put that in your Vodka and drink it .....However, Obama ( the Big Wimp )- ,  who has not done anything to help the Syrian people in 4 Years of the War and who would rather befriend an enemy like Iran rather than stiick with America's friends  (who are no longer America's friends ) and keeps on saying - we have your  Back - would rather lecture the World about how Jobs would solve the Moslem Extremist problem....What a joke !","In the long run, Russia belongs with Europe. Russians are basically Europeans in culture, ideology, and politics. In the long run, Mr Putin's method of governance will cease to be. In Europe, Russia can exercise a significant role. With China, it can be no more than a junior partner, subject to the suzerainty of a major player that won't accept Russian primacy in areas such as Kazakhstan and Mongolia, and runs the risk of losing effective economic control over Manchuria itself (it used to belong to China not long ago, if one wants to speak of historical precedents...)..This Ukraine imbroglio, whatever the result (a small slice carved out as an autonomous region, under the best of circumstances for Mr Putin), isn't going to change the long-term outlook for Russians of where they will feel most at home...It's a long ways down the Trans-Siberian to be schooled by the Chinese. I doubt most Russians want to be making that trip.","These are exactly the buttons Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are pushing -- threatening further isolation if Mr. Putin does not back down, and cooperation if he does, while rallying allies and pledging substantial assistance to the new authorities in Ukraine..The carrot and stick approach that President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry propose, in fact, only serves to inflame Mr. Putin's policies and regime further.  Mr. Putin believes that the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century was the breakdown on the USSR: a regime hellbent on competing against the West in isolationist fashion.  By offering isolationism as a consequence for not cooperating, US leaders are only increasing Mr. Putin's position within his own political sphere and bringing him one step closer to the end that he desires.  ..Europe is still very dependent on Russia's natural resources and Mr. Putin knows this.  Major gas pipelines that connect Russia to Europe run through Ukraine; by making a cursory step toward recapturing these, Mr. Putin is further exhibiting his command-and-control leadership style and his attempts to reclaim USSR territory.  ..The West's next move has to be to appeal to the Russian citizens and to fight through Mr. Putin's cult of personality to show them how these actions are perceived in the international community.  The USSR collapsed because of glasnost and a move toward transparency, toppling Mr. Putin's ego will require much of the same.",,,,,

Pat,,1,,"We keep talking of Russian kleptocrats and the endless circle around Putin who support him and in turn get the inside track on lucrative deals.  The Clinton Foundation is certainly not in that class, but it would be difficult for anyone to say that this is any way for someone who has sought the presidency for years should behave.  Hillary may talk of a vast right wing conspiracy.  She may say that she is being targeted because she is a woman.  And she may have a point.  However, she is also a one person arsonist who is fanning the flames that will consume her chances for the Presidency and seriously injure the Democratic Party for many years to come..There was a time when the Democratic Party stood for some values.  Now, unfortunately, leaders like Hillary hold their nose and pass the hat around","OK, so we have little green men in Crimea, sophisticated anti-aicraft missiles which bring down a plane full of passengers, other missiles which shoot down Ukrainian military planes and helicopters, indiscriminate shelling of civilians by insurgents who are supposed to be from the local population.  And Russia is not involved.  Putin and his kleptocrat friends are becoming more and more convinced that the West's red lines are merely suggestions.  Looking at it from their perspective, who can argue that every belligerent action in Georgia, Crimea and client states like Syria using chemical weapons are answered by rhetoric and back sliding.  So we either have to get accustomed to the notion that the West and its values are in permanent decline or make Putin's life not a little but a lot more uncomfortable.  Maximum sanctions which cannot be sidestepped with shell companies, freezing assets, curtailing international financial transactions, artillery and anti-tank weapons.  Ukraine will also need to decide whether, as a truncated state (by accepting the conquest of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea) it can join NATO and the EU","Attaboy.  Well articulated and to the point.  Half-hearted sanctions will never work because the Russian people have never benefited from the sham market economy everyone thought was happening, while Putin's inner circle of kleptocrats is immune to the outside world as long as resources are diverted their way.  This twilight war will go on as long as the Russian media can continue to pretend that it is about only a few volunteers.  Once Russian tanks and planes get blown up by the Ukrainian army, the world will know that Russia is involved and the pressure will mount for it to get out.","Ukraine put its neck on the chopping block when it agreed to surrender its nuclear weapons.  At the time, Russia was a signatory to the Budapest protocol that ratified the territorial integrity of Ukraine.  Ukraine again agreed to a ceasefire with Russia that was signed in Minsk last year and effectively surrendered territory in eastern Ukraine to Russian stooges.  Putin is playing a long game of brinksmanship, hoping that Western leaders will surrender by degrees.  When has that ever worked?","Putin is going for broke.  He has made the calculation that the US and EU are too self-absorbed with domestic concerns, and are wishing for the tooth fairy of half-hearted sanctions to make Putin unpopular at home.  They are also hoping that Russia can play a positive role with Iran and Syria and so should not get unduly offended. However, the truth is that his jingoistic and messianic policies are playing well at home, if only because he controls the media.  So he continues to enjoy the sort of popularity American presidents can only dream about.  His kleptocrat friends are still doing very well, thank you because the West is supine and the old KGB apparatus protects its own..So what's a vacillating West to do?  Recognize that these probes by Putin are in deadly earnest and, if not stopped, he will continue to try to rebuild the old Soviet Union on the backs of the Poles, Byelorussians and Baltic republics.  We need to do whatever it takes to draw a red line (however abused the term and execution have become and send sufficient aid to roll back the Russian army.","Humanitarian principles, my foot.  Putin freed this man to spruce up Putin's image because the Sochi Winter Olympics are coming up in February.  If we didn't have the Games (or, heaven forbid, Mr. Khodorkovsky was gay) Putin would never have touched him.","A great power must have a consistent policy and voice.  Every time a dictator gets mixed messages (Saddam Hussein prior to invading Kuwait, Assad with the red line fiasco) he sees the adversary as weak and indecisive.  Putin has ample reason to think that the US and Europe will make some noise and then feel better about themselves.  Gradual escalation of sanctions has been totally ineffective.  We must go for broke and try to inflict maximum economic pain on Putin and his kleptocrats.  Once their ill gotten gains dry up, their affection for Putin will as well","At the time of its independence, Ukraine was in possession of one of the world's biggest nuclear arsenals.  The Treat of Budapest, with Russia among the signatories, guaranteed Ukraine's independence and sovereignty in exchange for surrendering these weapons.  If treaties and guarantees are to have no meaning or consequences, then we are back to a Hobbesian world without rules..it is time to have full-out sanctions on Russian companies, freeze Russian assets and bar western investment in Russia.   It will be painful for us but more painful for Putin and his cronies.   We can pay now or pay later - the difference being that inaction, indecisiveness and prevarication will only yield more suffering and banditry.  Ultimately, the West will need to act, so we might as well take our medicine now and make a stand",Russia appears close to crossing the Rubicon.  It is one thing for Russia to be unambiguous in stating its need for maintaining a warm water naval base on the Black Sea.  It is an entirely different discussion when Putin places himself as the protector of all Russians regardless of where they reside and regardless of what nonexistent threats have been posed for them.  Such a role brings to mind Czarist Russia's placing itself as the protector of the Serbians and led to the First World War and Hitler's fulminations about the helpless Germans in the Sudentenland and Danzig corridor which led to the Second World War.,"The West has missed 2 golden opportunities to set the terms of the debate on Ukraine.  Last fall, the country was up for sale to the highest bidder.  The West dithered, while Putin promised Yanukovych 15 billion in aid and fuel subsidies.  Naturally, Yanukovych sold the country down the drain to the highest bidder.  When the demonstrations in Kiev turned to pitched battles, the demonstrators and then the provisional government did not spend enough time  ore receive sufficient counsel from the West to extend an inclusive hand to the Russophile parts of the country.  We now have a third chance that we should not blow.  The new aircraft carrier being built will cost at least 12 billion.  It may not even work as planned.  Wouldn't it be better for the US and EU to underwrite a Marshall Plan for Ukraine?  The oligarchs on both sides of the border are crooks and thieves, but they understand the value of money and are the only force to keep Ukraine together and moderate Putin's megalomania"
GL,,1,,"Putin is lying. According to the Ukrainian border patrol the Russian troops are still there so no change; and is not urging the separatists to call off the referendum, just to postpone it. The Russian and Ukrainian language news have a more accurate information. The whole thing is the same game he played before the Olympics, trying to look nice. Just this time it is his economic forum as alternative to Davos that is at stake. It is scheduled for May 22-24 and virtually non of the US top executives who were supposed to attend are going unless the Russia eases its pressure on Ukraine. Putin is a thug and a liar. Nothing changed.","The purpose of all this is to give the people of Ukraine, both Ukrainian and Russian speaking and all other ethnic minorities a chance to finally embark on a democratic course of development for their country! So that they can shake off their criminal and corrupt government and start building a free country and prosperous country for all! In the last 2 years Yanukovich and his Familiy amassed a fortune of over 12 billion - stealing from everybody. That's why you have people of every socio-economic level on Maidan today, from students to businessmen, from retirees to doctors, even retired police officers. And not just in the West of Ukraine, look at the map where mass demonstrations took place! Yanukovich's regime is possible only because of Mr. Putin's strong hand support and meddling. That's why people in Ukraine are against Putin's regime and not against Russia itself. They don't want to be forced back into the USSR style Custom Union with Russia. That is why the West should support Ukrainian people.",Putin is a CZAR in the genuine Russian tradition.,"If Ukraine were part of NATO already Putin would not dare even 1 of his aggression. That's the trait of the coward, he only bullies and hurts the vulnerable. After Putin's puppet Yanukovich almost completed his task of destroying Ukraine from within, Ukraine became an easy prey, or so Putin thought. But Putin can only think of a firs move on the chess board and will lose his game ultimately and be gone. The question is, how many lives will he take with him.","Ukrainian government offered decentralization of local powers, peace negotiations numerous time, amnesty to those separatists who did not commit crimes, etc. To no avail... Even now after Minsk the separatists say they don't want to make peace with Ukraine. Do you not see that this all beyond the point as this is not Putin's objective? No matter what concessions Ukrainian government is going to make it will never be enough. The whole thing is just a farce, a pretext to serve Putin's bigger agenda. Through how many layers do you need to cut to comprehend this?","Merkel, Holland &amp; Co are also responsible in part... you are willing to tolerate Putin's behavior - here is what you get. I hope Ms. Merkel will now re-read a chapter on Herr Joachim von Ribbentrop and Holland on Marchal Petain...","The Ukrainian security authorities have revealed intercepted radio communications of separatists reporting to their superior on the passenger jet being gunned down by one of their groups. Clearly,  Putin has no fear of God, why would he, he thinks he is God himself and the West's hypocrisy aids him in this belief.

However, if this separation was conducted with even a trace of legality, there wouldn't be a majority in favor of separation from Ukraine. There was NO separatist movement there until two months ago! Yanukovych promised to sign an association agreement with EU which he then under Putin's pressure dropped almost on the verge of signing.  Not even Donetsk and Lugansk opposed such association agreement with EU! So where did this urge to separate suddenly came from? The answer is in Transnistria, South Osetia and Abkhasia - its the same blueprint with an improved execution by Russian special forces and local vassals of the deposed Yanukovych.","This is very much America's matter as well, and not just because it has signed the international agreement guaranteeing Ukraine's integrity. Putin and his likeminded compatriots, KGB and communists - there are still millions of them, are united in one common ideology - which is extreme anti-Americanism, that manifests itself in every possible way in Russian society. There are too many people in Russia who did not forgive America Russia's humiliation in Cold War loss and the collapse of USSR; these revanchists are now calling the shots. They will not hesitate to harm America.","He will not. Putin doesn't care about anybody's opinion and he has surrounded himself with a lot of like-minded KGBs. The oligarchs will not ever brake rank - Khodorkovsky and Berezovsky were a good lesson for all of them - Putin can reach you in Russia, Putin can reach you in London, Putin will find you and punish you anywhere!"
End-the-spin,1,,,"The the bankers and militarists are driving the United States into another conflict with the same kind of hyperbole that led the wars we will be paying off for decades..They use terms like naked aggression, brutal land grab, they demonize Putin like they did Saddam and the Taliban. They talk of another Hitler, although the situation is nothing like that at all..Obama says this will hurt the economy. Oh really, what does he care about the people. They are expendable. What is important is the banks and militarists will continue to get their share of profit from it. After all, it is about the new world order, the ownership society. The banks want the Crimea and our military is there to give them what they want.","That's right. The Crimea was part of Russia before the United States existed..The language of the Crimea is Russian, not Ukrainian. The majority of the people in the Crimea are Russian, not Ukrainian..The Ukrainians are more than willing to sell off their country to the Western banks, the people of the Crimea do not. Ukraine sold a contract to Chevron to frack in the Crimea, over the objections of the people of Crimea..The Ukraine wants to join the EU. The Crimean state voted against it..The only reason the Crimea was given to the Ukraine by Kruschev was to further the policy of creating divided states that could be controlled from Moscow..Putin has undone that. The Crimea is again part of Russia...To compare Putin and Crimea to Hitler and Austria is absurd. Austria was never part of Germany, it was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire...Washington talks of naked aggression and a brutal takeover. Less than a handful of people dead and it is called brutal? This was no Shock and Awe prime time event that killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed the infrastructure of a nation that had absolutely nothing to do with 9-11 or al Qaeda. Iraq was absolutely no threat to the United States. Afghanistan, the same thing. Those were cases of brutal, unwarranted aggression--and what good have they done. Right, the oil industry rather than Iraq owns the Iraqi oil fields.","I agree, yet some here view Putin's actions it as some evil land grab. I guess it depends on who grabs what land..It is fine if Israel keeps up its non-brutal land grab and maintains a prison state called the Gaza strip. It was okay for China to take Tibet, afterall Wall St. has a lot money invested there. But Russia, no. We have different rules for them. Afterall, they are one of the few powers that doesn't want to sell itself off to the banksters.",,,,,,,

I suspect the Putin has threatened Merkel et al with the cutoff of natural gas if they support the Ukraine (this was easily predictable many years ago when the Europeans fell for cheap gas from recent dangerous foe). Will this surrender stop when Putin continues his policy of 'protecting'  Russians in Moldova, the Baltic states, Romania or Bulgaria?  Shades of Munich!",The Europeans have sold their souls to Putin for cheap russian gas so no effective sanctions are forthcoming especially with the Germand abandoning nuclear energy.,"I have absolutely no use for the guy, but Putin was never the KGB boss, just a mid-level functionary who happened to get the nod from Boris Yeltsin.","Haven't read all the comments so please excuse if I just repeat.  So glad John lost.  American foreign policy has been astray for a long time--VietnamSouth AmericaIraqAfghanistan.  These are all the old way of doing things.  We need an approach that is different, one in which we set an example of how things can be done.  Sabre rattling, and, to a lesser extent economic rattling, doesn't seem to win much.  And the cost to us in lives and wealth has been huge...So what do we do.  Confrontation with the bad guys just gets their spine up, and they don't want to lose face any more than we do.  So Big Bad John staring down Big Bad Putin doesn't excite me...If we really want to, we need to stop approaching things as if the solution must fit our interests and that's that.  And we have to do it sans crisis.  We have to operate in a manner that tells the world that rights and not economics really are our major concern.

Montreal Moe,,1,,Putin seems to would make a fine GOP Presidential candidate in 2016. Maybe we can find an English State of Georgia birth certificate.,"The scenario seems very much a replay of the 1970s where Big Oil puts the kibosh on a government leader seeking to wrest economic control from Big Oil. I well remember the swagger and defiance of Big Oil when they entered the Senate hearings.Sixty dollars a barrel is simply a small salve in oil's arsenal of economic weapons of  world oil..The erratic oil supplies of the 1970s destroyed the Presidency of the wisest, most compassionate and honest US president of my lifetime and paved the way for two puppets Reagan and Bush who were more than willing to turn the world over to the wisdom of international oil..I knew Putin's hubris would quickly lead to his downfall as surely as day follows night. The only question to really be decided is how much damage to international oil will be realized when the spike in the American economy allows our lame duck president to reinstate some degree of democracy in the Buckley Family and the Koch Brothers Oil Baron Feudal Republic..I thought James Buckley's Citizens United and the Koch Brother's utilization of the undemocratic judicial decision was the death knell for American Democracy but fortunately Putin couldn't play marbles..It is soon 2015 and the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.

wsf,1,,,There is some resemblance to this conflict and the Spanish Revolution with Franco the winner.  Stalin lost and Mussolini and Hitler used the war as military practice.  Putin wants as much of eastern Ukraine as he can get to ensure the safety and access ability for his Black Sea Fleet.  End of story.  I cannot see a different ending here.  War with Russia over this would be madness and Putin knows it.  No sanctions are strong enough to counter his move to keep Russia's warm water fleet.,"I am no admirer of Putin but we missed an opportunity when the USSR fell apart.  We really did not embrace Russia as an equal rather, there was a certain amount of gloating and certainly hubris in courting the former Eastern Bloc countries to get cozy with NATO thus allowing the West to encroach on Russia.  These moves caused a reaction in Russia that would not be unexpected in anyone that feels threatened.  There is a long memory in Russia over the invasion of Russia  by the Allies in WWI to prevent the Reds from exiting from the fight against the Germans.  The Reds beat back these Allied forces including some from the US thus completing the formation of the Soviet Union...It is probably too late to recover the potential for a friendlier Russia but we should at least recognize our complicity in the effort to push NATO to as close to Russia's border as possible.  Not so friendly action.",It is just so clear that Putin wants Eastern Ukraine back in Russia so that a clear land route to the Crimea is within Russia.  It also seems clear that a majority of the inhabitants of Eastern Ukraine are willing for that to be.  Let it be.,"Thank you Tom for your perspective on Putin.  Frankly, I have been commenting on articles in the Times for the past several years on the bad effects of NATO pushing ever eastward towards Russis.  I had not factored in the much greater threat to Putin and his gang from the eastward expansion of the EU.  I should have realized that geopolitically Turkey is far more of a NATO problem for Russia than just the Ukraine becoming a NATO member.  The taking of the Crimea was all about the Russian naval base but with NATO Turkey sitting astride the Dardanelles the Russian Black Sea fleet was always going to have difficult access th the open seas in the event of war with the West.  We really are in a different era when it comes to strategic planning in the event of the war that Putin seems to fear from the West.","We should not be surprised about Putin taking the action we see in the Ukraine.  His worst nightmare is to see the Ukraine integrated into the EU and NATO.  It is a great irony that we need Russia to transport our astronauts to and from the International Space Station but the eastern part of the Ukraine, at least, does not want to be in a relationship with Russia.  The West .overplayed their hand in further humiliating what has been perceived as a very weakened Russia ever since the breakup of the USSR.  I am no admirer of Putin but my reading of Russian history tells me he is consistent with the general flow of its past.  I see no long lasting settlement happening here soon.  However, I do not consider they are our enemy.","Just go back in time for a few years and you will find that the West was just a little too cocky thinking that Russia was now weak.  The attempt to encroach right up to their border was done with impunity, really.  When Russia lost its effort to keep Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania in its sphere of influence there was a certain amount if gloating in the West.  Putin's actions have all been backlashes to restore some pride in his Nation. ..Some things were going well between we and Russia.  The most dramatic thing is the use of Russia to get our astronauts to and from the International Space Station...We must remember that there was a coup in the Ukraine to remove a duly elected President.  Yes, he was not for entry of the Ukraine into NATO or the EU. Just imagine if.China tried to take Panama and the Canal into a defense arrangement so that the US could not use the Canal for supply purposes in the event if a war with China.  Our Carriers cannot go through the Canal but many other ships can.  I am no admirer of Putin but I do study history and I feel strongly that the West was overreaching in trying to bring almost all of the former Easter European States in Russia's orbit into the EU and NATO in particular.  We are partly responsible for this mess.","I will repeat what I have said in several comment sections this past several weeks.  Real Politik is at work here.  All Western Leaders know in their heart that the effort to bring the Ukraine closer to the West and even as far as NATO membership was fraught with danger.  Any cursory reading of Russian History will reveal how important a warm water port is for their navy.  Can we honestly blame any Russian leader for taking preemptive action to assure that their naval base in the Crimea was safe.  All indications for months now was that the West was possibly going to have the Ukraine in their pocket with the possibility that the Ukraine would be a NATO member.  Imagine Russia standing by while their major naval base is in a NATO controlled country.  ..I am not an admirer of most of the Russian leaders.  However, Putin is no dummy and has seen the future for Russia to be bleak if encroachment by the West continues to the East.  There was a time when it looked like Russia and NATO were going to get together and harmonize their interests so that European and Russian security was mutually guaranteed.  This opportunity has been lost it seems.  What a shame...I think we may be facing a move by Putin to take a big chunk of Ukrainian territory to enable Russia to have a land bridge to the Crimea and the naval base.  I don't think there is much we can do about it.  War with Russia would be madness and Putin knows it and certainly the Germans know this also.",,,
Vladimir Slaviansky,,,1,"Martin Dempsey: Putins ultimate objective is to fracture NATO..... The General obviously underestimates Putin. If even the Americans' polls (the Time) show that President Putin is the most influential politician, so the problem is more serious. I am sure that it is not about any single organization or country, but about the revaluation of values in general..The Americans have convinced everybody that their views are the only correct: if President Obama said that Malaysian Boeing was hit by the Russians, so the way it is! And there is nothing to lisp about some investigations, the presumption of innocence, etc..... After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the USA had a real opportunity to persuade almost all countries - to destruct the weapons of mass destruction and to choose the way of mutually beneficial cooperation, first of all, giving a lead: by destroying the weapons first, and pursuing an active policy of non-interference in the affairs of others, - leaving the existing conflicts on the will of the UN and the like..Instead of it, they chose a path of even more solid pressure and use of force against everybody, who disagree with the democratic choice of the United States, - taking on themselves the role of prosecutor, judge, lawyer and executioner....There is no King of beasts, Poor slaves, Inferior peoples, Racial discrimination, Social inequality in nature - but the nature itself has been existing for billions of years. So why do people have to be different?","NY times: Mr. Putin has been offered a far better deal than he deserves. Now it is imperative for the West to keep his feet to the fire..... How quickly the things are changing. A year ago, the US administration had warned President Yanukovych of the slightest use of force in Ukraine. Now, when Poroshenko is ruling, there was killed thousands of people and millions fled from Ukraine to Russia, America is going to support a fratricidal war, supplying arms to the Ukrainian army.  And Putin is to blame for everything! The cease-fire has not yet come, but the European Union has imposed new sanctions, Mrs. Merkel warned Putin, and the US State Department warned Putin. And everyone knows in advance, that the truce would rather not take place, than take place..Your sanctions and other measures only joined the Russian people around the President (85 support), who is acting against the capitalist community, which most of us consider as an international Mafia. The more sanctions, the harder is this belief.","NY Times: The decision also seemed to be a rare victory for the European Union and the Obama administration....Wikipedia: Today, it is believed that Globus II has an important role in the US anti-ballistic missile system. Located near the Russian border it is highly capable of monitoring and building a signature database of Russian missiles..The Globus II radar was installed and tested in 1998. That event meant a US unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and a direct threat to Russia's security. At that time, Russia was able to counter this threat only some verbal reprimands. The US and NATO had felt their full impunity and activated involving the Eastern European countries to NATO, one after the other. In the end, there was a turn of Ukraine. And only then, Russia tried to stop the expansion of NATO to the East..The result was - sanctions against Russia, the civil war in Ukraine, and destabilized situation in the vast territory. And now, the EU, US and NATO administrations shed crocodile tears over the suffering Ukraine. The whole course of events shows that the Western elite were going to get the whole of Russia as a raw material appendage to the Western countries..The growing popularity of President Putin among Russians means that ordinary people are not going to enter into the service of rich America.","NY Times: The decision also seemed to be a rare victory for the European Union and the Obama administration....Wikipedia: Today, it is believed that Globus II has an important role in the US anti-ballistic missile system.

And major world opinion is against Russia now.","The US and Europe's civilized nations can only do their best...But haven't we already trod this path with Milosevic? Milosevic would agree to a cease-fire. During it he would reposition troops and take over more ground. He continued making and breaking agreements for five or more years...At first a voice of reason Englishman, Lord Something-or-other would sit down with Milosevic in the name of peace. Milosevic violated every agreement. Finally, this lord realized that Milosevic saw the whole process as a game which he would win against the naive UN and he retired in disbelief and disillusion re such ungentlemanly conduct...The US's Cyrus Vance went thru the same drawn-out process, leaving it in disgusted disbelief...Putin is a land-grabber like Hitler, who first seized the Saarland, then  Memeland, to Sudetenland (rescuing Germans) to annexing Austria, to seizing all Czechoslovakia. Only KGB Putin is more gangsterish or thuggish. He has  leadership bona fides than Milosevic. ..Sorry for all the ad hominem remarks, but Putin has apparently been long known as a brawling thug. What secure deal can one make with a thug?..On the other hand, a shoot-out promises more downside uncertainty.","Those who try to work with a gangster-type have known this kind of fix before...Looking good, tough, and appealing to Russia's expansionists lessens most Russians' discontent and is pretty much all that motivates Putin and keeps him in his job. ..Think of an inner-city gang-leader of an especially aggressive gang. He wins big among his gang by making fools of police, of tax-payers, of anybody who operates by rules, etc. etc...Putin is the same quality as Milosevic, and a watered-down version of Hitler before 1939...In two weeks or more you are likely to read of Russia's attempts to grab more of the Ukraine.","Putin's motives mixed? Very likely! One wonders if Putin himself knows from minute to minute what he wants. ..A very disturbing man to have around. Like a defective grenade, he can do anything and he doesn't even know what will be next.

First, some peace-negotiator English lord negotiated a long string of cease-fires -- all soon violated. Then Cyrus Vance gave it a go. ...At length, each one finally abandoned his futile efforts, psychologically dazed. Hmmph! To imagine such people criminal Serbian leaders exist!..More of the sam in Ukraine? Seems a reasonable given Putin's belief-beggaring denials of responsibility for events. Like a two year-old trying to get the rest of the word to buy his brazen fibs...How long would Putin tolerate armed men, in Russia, speaking Ukrainian, claiming to protect Ukrainians, yada, yada?..If one did not know better, one might think it almost sit-comedic.","Will measures amounting to hardly more than gestures get anyone's attention?  Not likely.  And less likely to get Putin's attention. ..Relative to Russia's recent exclusion from the next G8 meeting, a recent NPR report noted that, during his last tour in office, Putin thought G8 meetings were boring and members were a crew of ineffectual jerks. ..Extreme G8 tameness equals worthlessness to a rough-and-tumble KGB operative who likes more muscular solutions to problems. ..Putin is not the 1st Russian leader so dismissive of light methods. Is any 2-by-4 equivalent at hand whose use, against Putin's pals and constituencies, would not also plunge the whole world into.war?",Put committee to study the problem?..Continue implicitly trusting the negotiation process which the other party sees as a neat pretext for smoothing matters over as it grabs more? ..That was Milosevic's way.

Enobarbus37,1,,,"State Department?  Try CIA.  They are the ones who have been completely discredited in Ukraine.  Brennan flies to Kiev after Putin takes over Crimea without a shot being fired?..Even if you share Mr. Cohen's opinions, you have to be disgusted and appalled at the inability of the CIA to get it right.  No one could have predicted that Putin would send troops into Crimea?  No one could have put in place a mechanism to defeat that act of aggression?..Well, let's think about it.  A Communist coup takes place in Labrador.  Labrador says it is breaking away from Canada and allying itself with Russia and will base Russian troops and missiles on its soil.  Would that elicit a response from the United States?  A military response?..How could the CIA have been so entirely brain dead not to predict that Putin would occupy Crimea, particularly seeing he already had troops there?..Or is it unpatriotic to accuse the CIA of any fault at all?","There is a language Moscow understands: antitank missiles, battlefield radars, reconnaissance drones.  Understands and presumably speaks...Which brings me to my point.  If we stipulate that Putin is the embodiment of Satan let loose on an innocent earth by dark forces lurking in the Russian subcontinent, we unfortunately have not gotten any closer to understanding what will work.  ..The Washington Elite were, through thick and thin, agreed that the Communist regime in North Vietnam was the embodiment of... etc.  However, their strategy for ridding the earth of this menace didn't work...Mr. Cohen, convince me that pouring arms, and the advisers that will inevitably go with them, will work.

donald surr,,1,,"There really is no comparison. Under our system Obama is destined to be out of politics for good in a little over two years. He will not again run for office. In Russia, Putin simply changes titles every few years while in effect staying charge for as long as he can muster the votes. He does that effectively.","Just as well that Putin discusses these matters with Angela Merkel, the acknowledged leader of the Western European nations. The U.S. is not a European nation. Pretending, like way back in the Cold War years, that we are Big Daddy anywhere but in North America is foolish delusion. Time has moved on. When will we emerge from delusion and adjust to the new world order?","The fact is that Russia feels, as it always has felt, that it needs to control the Black Seat port of Sevastopol and a land route to it. Russians  also feel a need to exercise control over the ports on the Baltic that are their main route for maritime trade with the west. They are fearful of Western invasion through Poland and the Ukraine and have ample historical reason to feel that way...Why is this so difficult to acknowledge? Is Putin really any different than those who have ruled Russia in the past? Are his fears and distrust of Western powers not quite predictable?","What Mr. Putin says about the Ukraine and whether anyone here believes him is irrelevant. It is what he can and will do that matters. He has made it clear that he intends to dominate the Crimea and will accept no back talk from those in the eastern Ukraine. He has the onsite military power, and control over the gas pipelines, to make good on that ambition. Like it or not, that is what is going to happen. Protesting headlines and jingoistic flag waving here will not change that..Why bother?",,,,,,
jdd,1,,,"What is rarely mentioned is that Putin also called on Ukraine's military to halt all repressive operations against pro-federalization activists in eastern Ukraine, and for the scheduled May 25 national presidential elections to proceed only after constitutional reforms are adopted. These last two requests have been rejected by the Kiev regime. In fact, Victoria Nuland's Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk,  promptly dismissed Putin's proposal as hot air. So much for Ukraine unity.","The following persons disagree with you and have called for sanity in the approach to Ukraine: John Sawyers, recently retired head of MI6 (reflecting the overwhelming view of Britain security establishment);former ambassador to Russia John Matlock, Henry Kissinger, Mikhail Gorbachov, Angela Merklel. Francois Hollande,and even Nicholas Sarkozy. But of course, from where you sit you are much wiser than these Putin Apologists and prefer that President Obama follow advice of the much more reasonable John McCain ,Lindsey Graham, Victoria Nuland, and Strobe Talbott,  among other peace lovers...PS: Note to President Obama. No country possessing ICMS which can be launched from land or sea is a regional power.","There was no rebel offensive, they simply held their ground. At Minsk, Putin tried to warn Poroshenko that his forces were surrounded and should surrender, but he wanted none of that. He should have listened to that advice as now the survivors and the Nazi battalions (Right Sector) are talking coup.","How is it that the U.S. is seeking to end the fighting in Ukraine? Is it by sending lethal arms to the puppet regime? Or may by ignoring Hollande's call to end sanctions and Merkel's insistence on a non-miolitary solution. Is the point to force Russia and Putin into a corner where his options are to back down or strike hard? Obama, who boasted of financial warfare against Russia in his SOTU address and admitted US support for the coup, is the first president to consider risking war with nuclear superpower Russia over territories clearly within Russia's sphere of influence and in a country in which we have no strategic interest. It must be stopped.","The continuing demonization of President Putin in the American media will not deter Russia from pursuing the destruction of IS, Al-Nusra, the Army of Conquest, and all the rest. While President Obama boasts of the most powerful military in the world, where is the machine that rolled over Sadam Hussein in six weeks, flying one thousand sorties a day, but can't defeat a ragtag collection of insurgents in more than a year? President Putin is aware that no small part of the jihadist force against Assad is Chechen and that it is not out of the realm of possibility for the CIA to activate its networks among them.","President Obama's response to President Putin's concrete proposals toward a negotiated settlement which can diffuse the crisis in Ukraine is a wildly provocative and inflammatory tirade in Estonia which can only be described as a total disconnect from reality. His support for proposed British led response team is reminiscent of the way Tony Blair provoked us into ongoing the debacle in Iraq. Only this time the target is, as Putin reminds us, a major nuclear power and the stakes are infinitely greater. In this age of thermonuclear weapons, such conflicts can no longer be solved by war.","So while Putin proposes solutions to defuse the crisis, the response from the West is a reckless speech by Obama in Estonia to openly provide military aid to Ukraine and create a rapid response NATO force. The insane war drive against Russia, as the NATO summit draws, near is pushing the world toward a potential nuclear showdown. Yes, Mr. Cameron it is like 1938 when your counterpart gave Hitler the green light to advance eastward toward Russia. How did that work out? But, really it is more like 1914.","Russian aggression? If aggression is defined as attacking without provocation then it applies to the Kiev regime not to Russia. Putin's actions from the very beginning have been in reaction to provocations from the West. For months, Moscow has tolerated continual bombing, shelling, and destruction of the ethnically-Russian cities of the Donbass, largely uncovered in Western media, despite the resulting deaths of thousands and hundreds of thousands of refugees flowing into Russia. While that this may be an intended goal of the Poroshenko regime, where are cries of Responsibility to Protect from Samantha Power and other.humanitarian bombers?' Instead, from Power we get an embarrassing Russophobic tirade at the UN. With the Poroshenko regime's refusal to negotiate a diplomatic solution, and its determination to wipe out all opposition, how long did we expect Russia to simply sit by and let the killing continue? As for more sanctions, they will undoubtedly hurt Europe more than Russia, as the EU's farmer sector is already feeling the effects of the loss of 6.5 billion in exports to Russia, which will have little trouble finding new vendors.","The real pressure is not so much on Putin but on Hollande and Merckle and is coming from the US. and Britain. Therush to judgmen, before an investigation has even begun, is reminiscent of the Sarin gas episode in Syria..One pretext being used, is simply that the Donetsk rebels are storing up the evidence for the official international aviation investigators, who have still not arrived on site despite all their appeals, rather than allowing the Kiev government to seize the evidence and falsify it in their usual way.","Of course the myth of the Russian invasion persists as the series of escalating sanctions goes on and on.When the people of Crimea  many of whom were ethnic Russians  voted overwhelmingly to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia, it was declared a Russian invasion although  Russian troops were already in Ukraine as part of a treaty arrangement respecting Russia's Black Sea fleet naval base..As for the MH17 pretext, rather than support Putin's call for a serious international investigation in which all sides could present their evidence and then draw conclusions,President Obama, the constitutional scholar, has opted to start with the conclusion first, and make the investigation moot."
Gene G.,,1,,"Most of us, including me, constantly comment on issues of national defense from the comfort of our air conditioned homes or offices, never having served in our armed forces and without any firsthand knowledge about the incredible complexity involved in analyzing international affairs. Rather, we gain our almighty omniscience from the internet ( which we know provides infallible information), newspapers, television, including MSNBC or Fox News and from other second, third hand or remote sources. Almost none of us have had any lifetime experience in the matters we so readily judge..I recommend that  everyone read Marek S's  cooments provided by someone who lived through brutal Russian aggression in Poland. Read his ( or her) story in the comments provided below to gain a personal insight into Russian military practices. Lest anyone claim that the policies of Russia today are different from those of the Soviet Union, remember the Mr. Putin is a product of the Soviet KGB and has publicly claimed that the worst geopolitical event in history was the breakup of the Soviet Union. Never forget the leopard theory.","The new Russia stifles free speech, jails those who disagree with Mr. Putin's policy, represses the media and pretty much obliterated freedom of the press, and now will force bloggers to register , effectively silencing even those opposing voices. The new Russia has laws against gays and practices institutionakl discrimination, and punishment, against gays. And you actuallty praise Russia for its historical moral position ? Try going there and publically questioning their policies and you will quickly learn how moral they really are.","It is so dismaying to read the many comments using this editorial to criticize the United States and worse, make some sort of moral equivilancy argument. One of the comments even alleged that US citizens are given the same form of propaganda, infering that we are no different than Russia..The stark distinictions between US policy and Mr. Putin's policies are endless, but will not be recognized by those who use every opportunity too bash this country. How they can stand living here is beyond me..However, I must address allegations that Americans are flooded with the same propaganda as if the press somehow deliberately distorts truth here..There is no freedom of the press in the Soviet - oops, sorry, I mean Russia..All media is controlled by the state in Russia and must report what the government requires. In the US, the  media is free to do investigative reporting and to tell all the facts it uncovers -and it does. Even supposedly biased media offset eachother. For every Fox News there is an MSNBC. For every tabloid, there is a NY Times. US citizens have endless sources of information which enable them to determine, freely, what the truth is. Our government is not controlled  by nor beholden to one person who controls the government message. Ironically, our partisan system, however maddening it gets at times, guarantees that all sides of an issue will be loudly debated..Of all countries in the world, this country assures that each of its citizens have access to truth.","Without an end game, this trading of escalating sanctions will reach the point of the ridiculous with nothing having been accomplished. What is the ultimate goal here? Crimea, for better or worse, is gone. If the goal is to prevent threats and incursions by Russia against former Soviet states, sanctions will do nothing to dissuade Mr. Putin...Using sanctions as its reaction against Mr. Putin, quite frankly, accomplishes little except to make the West seem weak and without resolve. President Obama and other Western leaders must make it clear in public statements and in all diplomatic discourse that overwhelming force can and will be used to prevent Russia from encroaching on any allies and independent states including the Baltic countries and certainly Poland, for starters. ..Use of these measures now will prevent, not accelerate, any liklihood of military escalation in the future. Mr. Putin may attack the weak, but he will not risk a provaction that will produce a military conflict he cannot win...Or, the West can continue its present course while Mr. Putin marches on to his next conquest.","As I expected, many comments and replies insisted on bashing the US for alleged demands it has made, thereby using those allegations as a basis to avoid commenting on the issue facing Ukraine today. Please, let's all agree that the US has certainly engaged in questionable comment. OK, now that we agree on that, now let's talk about Russia and Ukraine..Russia's demands against Ukraine  are not comparable, for example, to UN demands on Japan. Those demands concern acts by Japan outside its borders which could breach an international treaty. Germany's demands on Russia concerned acts of aggression by Russia outside its borders...Russians demands concern how a country must structure itself internally. That is a direct infringement upon the sovereign right of a country to govern itself and to change or adopt its own constitution. No country ( US included) can demand of another how it may constitue itself, with notable exceptions being countries defeated in war, such as Germany or Japan after WWII. And in those situations, the goal was to prevent those countries from ever again engaging in conduct which cost millions of lives..By contrast, Russia's conduct, if repeated, can result in Russia overpowering the will of all its neighboring countries . Putin's goal is to re-establish  an empire which ultimately thratens the security of the Western.  world.","Notwithstanding the lofty ideals of many who would avoid war by incessant diplomacy, the fact is that this world contains many bad people whose primary goal is to extend their power and control and to dominate other peoples of the world. No amount of diplomacy will ever change that. Tragically, it is as true today as it was in the days of the Roman Empire...The only thing such despots will understand is strong leadership  with the resolve to use whatever measures it takes to prevent their attempts at domination. This country has always provided such leadership and determination. Its mere existence has probably prevented many acts of agression by those who have feared what the United States might do...Sadly, that leadership is gone, or has been ceded to European leaders. Mr. Putin simply does not take the resolve of this country seriously anymore. He tested it with Syria and now laughs at us all the way to Crimea.",,,,
Paul,,1,,"Thank you, editors of the NY Times, for correctly putting the blame where it belongs: on the Russian president and not on the American president...If Putin succeeds in splitting NATO and gaining new territory it will be with the help of the same culprits who aid and abet the promoters and financiers of world terrorism: American conservatives and capitalists...After all, on Fox News it was Rudi Gulianni who told us directly that Putin is an example of what great leadership looks like...And it was Sarah Palin who told us that the bare chested Putin is what a real man looks like, and not our president who wears mom jeans.","Wow - all of a sudden, one after the other, we are presented will Putin apologists spewing the same line-by line distortions.  With their justifications in mind,  I am surprised they are not advocating Russian intervention for Brighton Beach.","There is no guarantee that, freed from war, the current Ukrainian government could succeed where previous governments--both those facing east and west--have failed. But it's the first national government in Ukraine with a clear mandate to end corruption and provide major resources to regions to run their own local affairs and improve their own communities. The only nagging issue for me has been that the last democratically-elected president left power without an election. Yes, he was outrageously corrupt. Yes, he broke his promise to economically align with the EU, which led to the protests against him. But he was still democratically elected. However, he did lose his legitimacy when his own forces fired on his own people. So his ouster (by his own internal allies, not the west) was justified. But Putin does not want a stable democratic Ukraine on Russia's border making economic progress. He seems adamant to keep Ukraine destabilized by his military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Western sanctions are justified. But sanctions, that can take many years to have an effect on Russia's behavior, are not helping the Ukrainian people. The west needs to engage Ukraine with much more economic aid than has been provided so far, and work with the national government to implement rigorous, transparent, and effective economic development programs in those regions not under conflict, so at least those Ukrainians outside war zones can have hope &amp; a better quality of life.","We must have hope that this dialog will reveal the strength of human intelligence gathered in numbers, allowing honesty for admitting our individual mistakes and unrealistic beliefs. I heard Putin's talk partially, and believe he has has asked for an honest dialog which is long overdue...If fanatical factions cannot be tamed with dialog, we are forced to use the justifiable evil of monotony: it's called violence.","World leaders are simply laughing at Obama and his empty words at the U.N. Putin ignores Obama's red lines in the sand of Syria and continues to arm the Assad regime while establishing Russian bases there for future use.  Meanwhile Crimea is now a Russian satellite state, and Ukraine is not far behind. China takes us to the cleaners in manufacturing and exports while we import nearly everything we consume from them. They own vast amounts of our federal debt which Obama has increased from 11 trillion to 18 trillion in 6 short years, and Obama has negotiated a pass for them on greenhouse gas emissions until 2026, while simultaneously tightening controls on U.S. energy and manufacturing companies. Obama capitulates to Iran's nuclear ambitions and turns over 150 billion to them for their purchase of more arms and munitions from China and Russia to further their terrorist activities world wide. The list of foreign policy blunders goes on and on. The Obama administration will go down as the most inept foreign policy presidency in our history.",Why apologize?  Putin may be rightstrategically correct about Syria but the guy is a near dictator and should be called out on it.  Nothing shameful there.,"What we should have learned by now is that the Bush-Cheney regime change policy that toppled the equally brutal Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, was and is a total failure,  It has left us a very weak Iraq dominated by Shiite Iran and the birth of radical Sunni ISIS.  President Obama also embraced the policy in overthrowing Muammar Qaddafi in Libya turning it into a failed sate and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt resulting in an even more tyrannical military dictator in Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.  So, we need to stop the blame game and, as Pope Francis urged, enter into a diplomatic dialogue with Russian president Vladimir Putin as we did earlier in eliminating Syria's chemical weapons.  If we don't we fall into the the trap of polarization the Pope warned us against: the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil. President Obama is no more a white knight than President Putin and the best way to end the refugee crisis would be for the two of them to talk with no preconditions and the goal of a peaceful solution the the Syrian civil war.","The Russians are quickly filling the vacuum that Obama created by his withdrawal of American forces and the threat of military force in the Middle East. Now watch as Putin solidifies Russian influence, and crushes ISIS. He and Russia will be seen as saviors, while Obama will again be seen as feckless and clueless.","Wait, Putin told everyone that there would be an immediate cease fire. I guess his message never made it to his Russian backed rebels in Ukraine.","Alex:  You are seriously misled, I'm afraid.  It wasn't NATO or the US that occupied and then annexed the Crimea.  It wasn't NATO or the US that started the war in Eastern Ukraine.  And I admit these were once part of Russia when it was the Soviet Union but that no longer exists. And the idea that the West engineered the overthrow of the previous regime is ludicrous.  The people knew the election was rigged. ..I think the Crimean people probably wanted to be part of Russia.  And probably the people of Russian extraction and speaking in Eastern Ukraine want to be part of Russia (the industrial heartland of Ukraine).  What of the non-Russian speaking peoples in the Eastern Ukraine?  Collateral damage? ..It is a conundrum that should be able to be resolved peacefully but I don't think that fits Mr. Putin's goal, which is to re-absorb ALL of Ukraine.  Followed by Moldova and the Baltics.  That will cause a war.  Do you want that?  I sure don't.  Expansionism creates strife."
Maigari,1,,,"For some inexplicable reason, the EU seems to have played along with the Maidan extremists and joined the US in heating up the divided Ukrainian polity. There was never a united Ukraine that wanted to join NATO, it was an extreme group that have found a soft spot with the US administration and with that the EU..To be fair to Putin, there is probably no other Western nation that would have reacted any differently to Putin's position given the same circumstances. Suspicion or not it is time that EU come to terms with the schisms that exist in Ukraine and  either make genuine efforts to reconcile the parties or keep to the one-sided track that is sure to lead to even more violence that in the end nobody wants.","Were the Ukrainian model the .normal' way of changing regimes, perhaps the world would have captured Putin and sent hom to jail.

George,1,,,"The Editorial Board writes (or copies from old foggy bottoom?) If he is not careful, Mr. Putin may end up facing exactly what he has railed against  a NATO more firmly parked on Russias borders  not because the alliance wanted to go in that direction, but because Russian behavior left it little choice. That is neither in Russias interest, nor the Wests.  The alliance chose to go that way--instead of not one inch NATO rolled hundreds of miles eastward, the West announced Georgia (on Russia's border) would join NATO; Putin reacted as any Russian leader would have.  The NATO announced it would include Ukraine, also on Russia's borders.  Putin has acted, again, as any Russian leader (not chosen by the US) would.  The US wants to encircle and diminish Russia and China as it seeks world-wide hegemony (bases in almost every country on earth).   John Mearsheimer (Foreign Affairs recently is right--the west, for whatever reason, has decided to reopen and rewin the Cold War--or was it just the brass at NATO securing their cushy jobs that were endagered by the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact?","If you think our Iraqi debacle was a position of leadership, then you sir are terribly delusional. Whereas Putin sends Russian troops in disguise to agitate in Ukraine, there is really nothing we can do other than start a destructive war. Is this something you feel would constitute good foreign policy? Bush's chickens are going to continue coming home to roost. So stop blaming Obama for being put into an impossible situation on the domestic as well as the foreign policy front.","While I can appreciate Mr. Putin's unease of having NATO at his doorstep, I remember being in Fulda, West Germany in the 1960's. It seems the Warsaw pact was just miles away across the Czech border. Looks like this game can be played both ways. ..I can imagine the outrage in Washington if Canada or Mexico allowed Russian bases or missiles to be deployed near our borders.","The Russians were twice promised that NATO would not expand eastward.  It did and basically at the instigation of the US.  Don't blame Putin for the crisis--if Gorbachev were in charge things probably wouldn't change.  Russia doesn't want an enemy base on its border, the US would not have an enemy base 90 miles away (Cuba).  Treat the Russians the way you will not stand for and they won't stand for it.","McFaul's essay proves that he was a terrible choice for an ambassdor to the Russian Federation and right at home in the Hoover Institute, founded to oppose the ideas of Karl Marx (all of them).  Clearly McFaul wants the cold war restarted and fought to a unconditional Russian surrender--democracy and market, but if democracy leads to another economic system (or a mixed system), then that's not a real democracy and it should be over thrown as in Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, Grenada, Haiti, Indonesia long ago and the bodies still uncounted (3 million?).  For two very sensible papers on the current crisis, I recommend John Mearsheimer's Getting Ukraine Wrong (NYT, 13 March) and Mark MacKinnon's How the West lost Putin (the Globe and Mail Toronto, Canada.  MacKinnon includes McFaul in his story: the ambassador, on arriving in Moscow, soon met with leaders of the anti-Putin faction and convinced Putin that the west intended to meddle in Russian politics.  And of course, the US plan to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO posed a military threat.  The US had conniptions when the Soviets stationed missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles away.  How about NATO missiles one mile away? But the US is exceptional, of course.","The point of Bush's attack on Iraq was control of that country's oil--and he got it.  Big US oil now controls Iraq's oil fields--the American people lost the Iraq war (they paid and are paying for it in money and ruined lives), but Bush, Baker, and the other big oil people won.  Putin is responding the the eastward movement of NATO which Bush promised him wouldn't happen and did.","Nicolas Berger might remember that Putin moved in Georgia only after the US announced that country would become part of NATO--and so too with Crimea and eastern Ukraine.  History depends on accurate chronology--and Berger puts the later event before the earlier to arrive at his conclusions.  NATO acted, Putin reacted.","Putin may or may not annex the Russian-speaking (and Russian-thinking) parts of eastern Ukraine, but he will  not enter a quagmire west of the Dnieper river.  The best informed and best argued comment on Cohen's cold war piece is Paul's (of Virginia).  Apparently hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking Ukrainians have fled to Russia to make new lives there.  Neither Ukraine nor Russia are real democracies, but the pay and pensions are better in Russia.","What would have happened if the Soviet Union had announced that Mexico and Canada would become members of the Warsaw Pact and to that end, the Soviet ambassador to Canada had helped start a ruckus that evicted a pro-American Prime Minister from office and installed a new Prime Minister agreeable to joining the Warsaw Pact?  Why would Russia now not act, with NATO threatening to move right up to the Russian border, as the US would have if the Warsaw pact was ready to move next door?  When the Soviet Union broke up the West promised --twice-- NATO would not move east, but it did.  Then Georgia and Ukraine were to become members of NATO--right on the borders of Russia?  Putin knows--I would guess--that yielding to sanctions is like paying blackmail--the sanctioners, like blackmailers, will just keep on demanding more.  If Putin backs down, he will be replaced by a more determined nationalist.  As for indignation--outraged law and international norms--review the history of US interventions in Central and South America.  Russia is behaving like a typical gret power whose neighbours have taken up an annoying (and threatening) position.","Mr. Friedman as usual I agree with your article but it is clear that you give Obama too much of a pass. Obama came into office believing he could charm other countries such as Iran and Russia into liking us, and he then gave away valuable trading assets to Russia for nothing in return.  Putin is an old world thug who would see Obama's internationalism as weakness. A man of his mindset would have no other way to understand it. Weakness on a global stage, furthermore, creates a vacuum and invites action by bad actors.  So you may next see China try something with Japan.  Obama's red-line comment, in addition to his internationalism, destabilized our earth and you would be fair to address that."
Kevin,,,,"I agree that Obama's approach way better then Bush'es or McCain. Still I would prefer someone like Ron Paul to not get involved in the first place..Let me remind that for three months Obama supported riots in Kiev until the democratically elected (though corrupted) president was replaced. You can blame Russia as much as you want, but at the end of the day there are a lot of people in Ukraine who voted for ousted president and who hates the new government since it came to power against their will. Event by Kiev's own polls 74 do not trust the new government. Russia might help the sentiment, but even without Russia, the sentiment is there..So Obama put himself in situation where he needs to show support to coup installed government. He has to close eyes on the abuses by Ukranian nationalists from the west. He has to give a lot of money to Ukraine. And he lost any support from Moscow anywhere he needs it...Frankly I see US loosing here from Obama's point of view. Maybe it is winning from MCCain point, but I do not care about that Muppet...For me the high point was when Obama and Putin managed to agree on Syria without starting another war.","It is funny when Americans thinks that Obama's sanctions made Putin to do what it did today. Remind you that Kerry and Obama talked to Russian counterparts many times for no effect. Only recent event in Odessa, Slovyansk and conversation with Swiss head of OSCE did something and Putin seemingly changed his approach. American did nothing to help it...I strongly believe Americans (including Obama's advisers) have very wrong understanding of Russian mentality. And what ever Americans did in the part six months only turned situation to worst.","I see a lot of comments from people that, more or less, call for the US to drop out of this fight because we don't have interests involved and are just as 'guilty' as Putin in defying international law. We will assist Ukraine because it weakens Communism and there are legal precedents for us to do so in international law. Simple as that. We do have interests in Ukraine, they just aren't apparent today. Having Ukraine join the EU and NATO puts us and the rest of the world on Putin's (military) doorstep. Not to mention, in the near future, having energy alliances with EU members and NATO members will most likely happen and we will be abundant in Natural Gas. Insert US and we profit tremendously. Finally, if we can flip Ukraine in the blink of an eye to be our ally, that price tag is well worth 15B investment as it will no doubt pay off. Think about today's war: Drones, cyber attacks (gas lines), spying, etc. It isn't pretty, but it's the truth.","Just imagine what the US would do if Hawaii voted for independence and Russia or China backed it up (not to mention Crimea is a lot closer, has its Russian roots, and is also of great strategic importance due to the Russian fleet)..Of course Putin's going to be provoked by the fact that the US decides to march onto its front doors. True diplomacy should be about empathy and compromises. American politicians should learn that You're going to do this, this, and that or I'm going to slap you (with a sanction) works great with small countries, but not against a nuclear superpower that has traditionally be the subject of intentional isolationism.",it would work if Ukraine will not become NATO with US forces stationed in it and pointing guns at Russia. I cannot blame Putin much - he sees the ring of NATO getting tighter around his country and he fights back.,Wow.  I can't tell if the majority of commenters here are (1) Putin sock puppets getting paid a dollar a post or (2) naive about international politics and suffering from massive false equivalency disease or (3) just not very smart.,of course peaceful protesters on one side and terrorists on the other side..Yanukovich is bad because he kept police holding the line while peaceful protesters burned them with Molotov cocktails..But it is ok for pro-western puppets to send military to suppress descent for their own protection..Cheerful west helped spread democracy by removing the president. But Putin meddling in the business of the Ukraine with his evil plans..Helpful Biden brough 50 millions and suggestions to run power stations on manure. But Putin is absolutly shamefully tried to by Ukraine with 15 billion help. Just look at his histerically loufing with Yanukovich. What you can possibly expect from the man with such a grin.,"Tom---The Obama talking points fail to tell the whole story..Obama has made this country weak to our friends and foes..In Syria, thousands of children have been killed, injured.or uprooted.

bd,,,1,... years of US aggression !? During the Obama presidency!? Putin fears Obama!? Obama is the guy who hit the reset button  with Russia ... and with the Islamic world ...,Wrong analogy ... Putin was successful in Chechnya and that success served as the foundation for his long term dominance of Russian politics. Perhaps Russias intervention in Afghanistan would be the more apt analogy.,"Rather surprisingly, or maybe not so surprising considering the NYT readership,the drift of many of these comments seems to be that Putinism is a good deal for Ukraine. It's rather disturbing that a flaccid EuroU.S. social democratic liberalism is no match for an intensely focused nationalism as exemplified by Putin's nationalisttheocratic  New Russia . It's the conundrum of where to set the limits of tolerance. We in the U.S. tolerate considerable anti-U.S. opinion even when it's voiced in favor of an anti-Western autocrat. Does the value of tolerance require tolerance to the point of suicide of the attribute of tolerance?",,,,,,,
Winthrop Staples,,,1,"Putin does not respect us for the same reason as Stalin did not! We got all high an mighty, holier that thou about what Hitler did to Jews and people in western Europe, but allowed Russian leaders to do precisely the same things to Jews second Holocaust, East Europeans and their own people. The US allowed Russia to stomp on, murder and send millions of Ukrainians to gulags (very high proportion of people in Russian Far East are descendents of Ukrainians deported there) prior to, during and after WWII, and commentators say little about that. So of course Putin does not think we will protect these people now any more than we have in the past. Even though they were slaughtered by the millions fighting Hilter - we betrayed them after the war.

Howard,1,,,"Not unsurprisingly, the NYTimes has published an editorial on Syria that stands the historical record on its head and twists facts to suit a narrow (might I say arrogant) American agenda.  ..It is the United States and its allies in the Syrian opposition (the now non-existent moderates), along with the wretched autocracies of the Gulf that have consistently resisted compromise in Syria.  Already in August 2011 the Washington Post (August 18, 2011) was reporting Washington's insistence that Assad must go (i.e. regime change in Syria) as a precondition for a settlement in Syria.  ..This was followed by multiple red-lines, most infamously that laid down by Obama in his news conference of August 20, 2012 concerning the use of chemical weapons.  While forensic evidence made clear that chemical weapons were used in Syria in 2013, responsibility for their use--opposition or government--has never been established, though Western governments (but not the UN) have repeatedly assigned it to the latter.  Ironically, it was Putin who facilitated an American climb-down on the issue...Now comes a report (The Guardian, September 15, 2015) based on senior negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, that already in February 2012 the Russians proposed Assad cede power after peace talks between the opposition and regime had begun, but were stiffed by the US, Britain and France...One can only wonder who has been acting in bad faith, the Americans or the Russians?","Excellent ideas!

SW,1,,,"Candidate Obama styled himself as the great diplomat, yet time after time he has refused to talk to or meet with Putin on grave matters of international concern.  Russia proposed a Syrian peace plan in 2012, but Obama thought Assad would step down and so declined to take the proposal seriously.  Obama acted like, and still acts like, a petulant child, and the Syrian civil war rages on.","I agree.  Unfortunately, Obama's reset with Russia set the tone, in that the reset involves stonewalling Putin and refusing to talk to him and instead issue press releases saying we are going to arm the Ukrainians.  Obama couldn't even be bothered to send someone to negotiate with Putin, Merkel and Hollande.  What a wasted opportunity to engage in multi-lateral discourse.","How disingenuous to say Merkel and Hollande didn't tell Obama they were going to meet with Putin.  It was not all over the foreign press, but also in this very publication for days beforehand.  If Obama can drop what he's doing to take an entourage to pay respects to a dead Saudi King, and Kerry can drop what he's doing in India to belatedly show up in Paris after the terrorism there, then Obama could have and should have stopped what he was doing and gone with his fellow NATO leaders for this important diplomatic initiative.  Instead, he is stonewalling Putin like a petulant child.","UNITED NATIONS  Obama once again raises the fallacy that ISIS can be defeated with ideas, jobs and good governance, despite the fact that a sizable number of ISIS leaders and Western jihadists who go to Syria to fight are from wealthy backgrounds and are well-educated.  These are not marginalized people, and it is worrisome that Obama cannot, or refuses to, understand that their extreme religious doctrine drives their killing machine..If Obama had his way, he'd likely increase our taxes to pay for job retraining and therapy for jihadists while US vets and the poor are living on the streets.  Thankfully, Putin is now on the scene to take care of ISIS once and for all.","Yes, you'd think so, but perhaps Obama wanted a nuke free Ukraine so that his buddies in Big OilBig Gas could come in and make a huge profit once Putin did exactly what he just did.","@Easterwa-woman:  Kind of like Dubya doing whatever he wanted?  Well, at least he got the approval of Congress before invading sovereign nations.  Obama says that's not even necessary.  Want to bomb Libya into regime change?  No problem, call it a kinetic action and fire away.  Yes, he actually stated that he did not need to even consult Congress prior to starting a war.  Same deal with Syria.  He said he didn't need to get Congressional approval as the war on terror is global, so he can bomb who he wants.  Then there's the ever present drone bombings on whomever Obama hates on any given day.  So does Putin's action bother me?  Not more than our last 2 imperial presidents' opinions that they can do what they want, when they want, without listening to our elected Congressional reps.","Obama fires off endless rounds of sanctions against Russia, yet says nothing about Egypt sentencing 680 political opponents to death.  One has to wonder why he is so personally offended by Putin's actions, and how as a world leader, he cannot even raise his voice against oppression in Egypt, C.A.R. and other hotspots around the world, much less punish those offenders.  The hypocrisy is staggering.","Don't forget our president in your formula.  By abandoning Bush's eastern European missile shield, he signaled to Putin that the US wouldn't interfere in Russia's backyard.",,

I would love to see the day that Obama walks the walk as opposed to talking the talk.","Anne, Obama's hands are tied but much of what tied them occurred earlier in his Presidency that convinced Putin that Obama was a weak President. In this situation he had no more bullets left. He had already removed the missile defense system. He had shown an over eagerness when telling the Russian President that he would be more flexible after the election. He had shown a fecklessness bordering on recklessness in Syria and letting Putin walk him out of there was another show of a weak an ineffective foreign policy. It was all those things that left Obama disarmed. He couldn't rally allies to him because he couldn't be trusted nor could he be believed. There is no teleprompter in foreign affairs."
Ecce Homo,,1,,"I disagree with the near-consensus among the comments so far, that the United States is doing something improper in Ukraine, and I'm shocked that many commenters perceive equivalence between American and Russian treatment of Ukraine...Russia has for years put the screws to Ukraine, withholding and threatening to withhold natural gas shipments to get Ukrainian agreement to Russian goals. In 2008, Vladimir Putin announced that if Ukraine joined NATO, Russia would annex Eastern Ukraine and the Crimea. Russia has insisted on a right for its naval vessels to cross into Ukrainian waters without permission. Neither the US nor the EU has ever been so overbearing or so hostile toward Ukraine...It's true that Russia on one side and the US and EU on the other are competing for Ukrainian trade and affiliation. By itself, that is not meddling or interfering, but lobbying and negotiating. But any suggestion of equivalence is utterly refuted by the fact that if Putin gets his way, Ukraine will be more autocratic, whereas if the US and EU get their way, Ukraine will be more democratic.

The Crimean public was called to a referendum - granted, on just days' notice and with no real voting options - on Crimean separation from Ukraine. Then a reconstituted Crimean Parliament voted for separation from Ukraine and annexation by Russia.  The Russian Parliament, popularly elected after an election campaign during which opposition media were shut down, then voted to approve annexation. And Putin signed annexation into law...We in the West may not call that democracy, but it is nonetheless telling that Putin found it necessary to pretend that democratic processes were at play.

Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, was president of Russia for eight years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he was no Putinesque bully...Russians who had lived with authoritarian rule for 70 years were not entirely comfortable with the disorder of democracy and the chaos of capitalism.

The difference in this case is Russian personnel and weapons (if not actual members of the military) have crossed a sovereign border to help the separatists. Putin has consistently lied about this deliberate Russian involvement. Now an airliner has been mistakenly shot down by the forces that Russia has supplied and trained. This is about whether Russia will continue to lie, or whether they will take some responsibility for what has happened, recognize their mistake in arming and training rebel factions, and help the region work toward a diplomatic settlement of the Ukraine problem. Russia is center stage and the world awaits their response.

A diplomatic solution in Ukraine is possible, but only if that is the pathway Putin chooses. That is why all the world's focus should now be on Putin. In one sense it doesn't matter who is to blame, for blame itself solves nothing; in another sense it means everything, because unless Putin accepts responsibility and decides there needs to be a change, a diplomatic solution in Ukraine will be impossible, and the madness that really caused the crash will continue.",The US government explanation to the world for this obvious error was that everyone makes mistakes.....Have you heard Putin say everyone makes mistakes?

Ronald Cohen,,1,,Putin may have discovered that once having started the fire it blazes out-of-control and putting it out is a very different proposition from lighting the match.,"It would be shocking indeed if those friendly to leaders would come away empty-handed.  Such people would be candidates for sainthood but, whether this is praiseworthy or blameworthy, it is not at all restricted to Putin's Russia and is hardly alien to today's Washington or any other capital or leader.","The Czars did it with distributions of titles, money and favor -- all with the blessing and the support of religion -- so Putin does it with money and favor.  The more things change, the more they remain the same.","The illnesses of nationalism, exceptionalism and religious intolerance shall, if untreated and uncured, shall prove fatal as it breeds fanatics of all stamps viz., the snarls of John McCain and Putin's imitation of Ivan the Terrible.",,,,,,
Rich,,,1,You deserve credit for:..(1) An outright lie about Russia and China's amity...and..(2) Another misstatement of facts concerning President Obama's role in bolstering Putin's totalitarianism...and..(3) Revisionist history lessons.,"As the Crimean annexation and the continuing violence in Ukraine has shown, Russia will always like to make sure it's influence is being exerted on the beleaguered country. One thing to remember is that Mr. Putin is on a mission.now of pushing so-called Russian ' exceptionalism'. Part nationalistic and partly a defense against NATO, it drives Russian political behavior in that area of the world. Ukraine is now experiencing its wrenching results. Perhaps the next question is are the Baltics in Mr. Putin's eye, i.e. to weaken them as well?.At this point, it's apparent that Mr. Putin does not want a strong and successful Ukraine to its western flank. Ukraine, a sovereign nation, will surely have to overcome that if it expects to fashion her future unfettered to a Eurasian 'bully'.","Yes, Mr. Putin knows he has to be careful there. But may I submit the calculation that Mr. Putin did where here in the 21st he pulled off literally a real estate 'steal' under the noses of the EU, the US and the West. The latter let Mr. Putin be a broker on his own deal! ..I am not suggesting Russia will 'go into' the Baltics tomorrow. But only noting that if the time and situation presents itself 'calculations' can change. Mr. Putin is not naive. He's learned much in his KGB days.","Typical Europe...bury your heads in the sand as always and ask America once again to fight your battles.  Do you ever learn?  Do you think the Germans who were responsible for two World Wars might DO THE RIGHT THING for once and stand up the the Rusians with strong econimic sanctions?!  Of course not, they'll just continue placating Putin and protecting their own greedy economic interests.  Oh, congrats on your World Cup victory...quite the accomplishment.  Keep up the good work.","Wasn't it only a short time ago that nearsighted commentators were proclaiming that Putin was playing chess and Obama checkers? Reality check for Putin, who sometimes becomes a victim of his own ego...This should also provide the US with an incentive to overcome regulatory red tape that is slowing the approval process for exporting LNG to Europe.",Putin's priority is what in his view are wrongs to right. End of story.,,,,
Dan Stackhouse,,,,"Dear Mr. Binion,.You raise good points, and I'd like to point out that I respect your opinions and appreciate what you've contributed to these debates.  And I like the avatar picture too, with the Beluga...I agree that technically Russia could have kept its port anyway, but Putin and that gov't are far more paranoid than the average bear, and they didn't think the agreement would hold.  I wouldn't have moved to seize it, but they would (clearly).  I would bet that it's preferable to Russian ports on the east coast of the Black Sea due to channel depth and infrastructure already built.  It would take years to dig out a port and build all necessary dry docks and such in Sochi...I think you're wrong about our ability to blockade them though.  They could take that as an act of war, everyone knows where that would lead, and so I just don't think we'd do it outside of wartime, in which case they'd fight their way out anyway.  Possibly by widening the channel with hydrogen bombs...And I do agree that more than half of Ukraineans probably want to join the EU, but a minority do want to join Russia or become independent.  So the split wouldn't have to be equally sized, to accomodate this, and actually western Ukraine is lesser as far as resources go...Anyway good chatting with y'all and hopefully this will go as smoothly as possible, however it turns out.","Dear Wesley,.I never made any indication I had blind faith in Putin.  I just know it's not logical for Russia to be our enemy, and that Putin is a logical man, unlike for example, Palin.  I don't think he's well-meaning at all, he's very ruthless and amoral, but he does do what logically works best for him and for his government...Also dear Swatter,.Thanks for the update, if the troops get removed, I'm right anyway, if they wind up invading Ukraine, I'm wrong.  I don't much mind either way.","Ah yes, as I recall, when this cease fire was announced I stridently insisted it wouldn't work and fighting would resume immediately, if it stopped at all.  As usual people claimed I was Putin himself; I don't suppose I'll see them apologize to me in this round of commentary...So I'll say it again.  The U.S., NATO, Russia, and anyone else who wants to play ball, have got to work out terms on how Ukraine is to be divided up and managed.  This worked wonders for Yugoslavia, and Germany after WWII (well, West Germany did OK), and it's working for East Timor and South Sudan after a fashion.  It's the only remedy here, these people have to be divided with U.N. forces patrolling the border for a decade or so, in order to have peace.  And that division must be acceptable to the U.S. and Russia both, everyone in Ukraine will just have to learn to deal with it.  So long as anyone from either section can emigrate to the other, or anywhere else, I don't see as how it's a terrible fate...Now feel free to shout me down and call me a Putin apologist, even though I keep saying I think assassinating him is a decent path forward for Russia.  Just bear in mind that I was right about this useless cease-fire, and I'm still right now.","It occurs to me that this must be really annoying to Germany.  Not for the imperialist, aggressive moves, or the breakdown of Ukraine, but because everybody keeps calling Mr. Putin akin to Hitler, and invoking nazis.  Russia calls Ukraine's new thug government nazis, others call Russia the new nazis, and make all sorts of clever references to Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain, and the like.  So Germany must be like, guys this is history, very few of us were alive at the time, nobody's acting like nazis here and we certainly aren't, so could y'all stop throwing it in our faces already?  Jeez, get over it...Anyway this update doesn't seem to have any new information.  Mr. Putin is poised to take over Ukraine, NATO is going to wisely not stop him (let's all pray), Ukraine is discombobulated and fracturing, and so far there's been remarkably little bloodshed.  This has been the same story for at least three weeks, could we either get some new information or let other things get stories until something happens in Ukraine?  I'd be fine too with just getting a headline one day, Russia has taken over Ukraine completely, will fight guerrilla war for 20 years until retreating in economic collapse, so on to the next crisis.","Say, what's with all these Dans popping up lately?  Anyway, 'ruskies' is a really dated term, makes you sound a little like McCarthy.  The comparison of Putin to Hitler is also wildly off the mark; so far Russia has killed next to nobody in Ukraine, not near the number of people Ukraineans have been killing.  And the concept of attacking Russia in any way indicates a desire for armageddon, due to some sort of loathing for humanity as a whole I'd guess...We are not going to fight Russia on this because it is in no way worth it, and Ukraine brought this on themselves.  Putin is not Hitler, this will go no further than Ukraine, and the sooner it's over and done with the sooner they can go back to cleaning up Chernobyl.  By the way, Chernobyl has the potential to kill far more people than this conflict does, so it's rather more important than who governs Ukraine.","Thanks Jack, totally my bad.  When Ms. Wolf's comment was right over yours, it honestly looked like you had replied to her, so I was being chivalrous and surreal in my miscommenting.  Also I wouldn't believe Mr. Putin unless I saw he was deadly serious (and then I would be very worried), and the occasional surrealism is more enjoyable than watching clocks melt off trees, for sure.","Dear KJ, Sophia, and Jiminy,.I can't hold Putin directly responsible for the horror that is Syria, because then I'd have to hold President Obama responsible as well, since he also could have stopped the slaughter at any time.  I've been advocating drone striking Assad for years now, and we truly should have done it.  I can hold Putin responsible for the deaths in Chechnya; let's say that's about 100,000 dead.  That's less than the death toll enacted directly by President Bush by a long way.  I'm not saying Putin is a good guy, or that I'd like to live in Russia, I'm saying he's not the height of human evil like Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Assad, or others of that ilk.  And for the love of all that's holy will you all stop being so aggressive about this debate, we do not set policy and Putin is not reading any of this.","There is no way that the U.S. should either ship arms to Ukraine or get involved militarily in this conflict.  This is Ukraine's civil war, and Russia is involved heavily, and it's on their western border, and there is no way for us and Russia to fight without it turning nuclear.  And of course if it goes nuclear, that's it for civilization in the northern hemisphere at minimum, with a possibility of being the end for humanity as a whole.  All of Ukraine is not worth that chance...However, peace in Ukraine should be the goal here, and it has to be accomplished through negotiating with Russia.  And Russia must therefore be sanctioned, far more heavily than it has been, and constantly hampered in their efforts without actual military confrontation.  When Russia really feels the pain, Putin will finally negotiate, and I think it's clear that what he wants is Finlandized Ukrainian states on his border, with west Ukraine doing whatever it wants...And breaking up Ukraine is the way to go, these people clearly can't live together, it's like Yugoslavia, Iraq, Yemen, lots of violent nations.  Best way to handle it is break up the tribes, relocate everyone, and thus have all the new nations small and powerless.  Note all the Yugoslavian sections have been zero trouble since they were partitioned.  It's what has to get done in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen too, and it'd be best for Ukraine...Lastly, if Russia does want to absorb all Ukraine, that's fine too.  Just so long as the killing stops.","I know most Americans have bought into the jingoism about Putin being Hitler reincarnated and all that jazz, but it seems to me that Putin has one right idea here.  An international coalition to wipe the Daesh off the map is what's needed.  They couldn't have more than 100,000 fighters, probably not even half that, and it would be fairly easy to defeat them terminally, as they've no air force, navy, or heavy weaponry...I believe Assad should die (or be removed from office, if we want to wimp out about him), but that should be handled after the Daesh, and only once a plan is in motion to control Syria afterwards.  Assad is the vicious dictator that held those warring tribes in check, and if he's gotten rid of without any notion of what power structure to put in place, we'll only get another Iraq or Afghanistan...I wonder at Russia's bombing of Homs, as the Daesh don't control it, and it's likely they're attacking other rebels in order to shore up Assad.  Could be they're just blowing off steam...At any rate, whoever's getting bombed, there will be that many less starving refugees fleeing Syria when the water runs out in a few decades, and that's all for the best.  In this century Syria will cease to exist from lack of water, so if anything's to be done about making its end more humanitarian, a good time to start is years ago.","I will be so ruefully amused if all this clamoring for arms to be shipped into Ukraine works.  And the arms get shipped, the fight intensifies, the piles of dead mount, Russia escalates, the U.S. sends military advisors, Russia kills some U.S. troops, we go to war, nuclear missiles fly, civilization ends...Yeah yeah it's doom talk, but it's all completely possible, and it all starts with the U.S. getting involved in Ukraine.  And y'all will call me paid by Putin because that's your constant obnoxious claim about anybody who doesn't want this war to grow.  But it doesn't matter, if this results in the end of most life in the northern hemisphere because of idiotic warmongering, I'll have the last laugh."
Syed Abbas,,,1,"Putin speaks with 80 Russians and most of the emerging world  BRICS, Iran, et al backing him. Mr. Obamas conduct is likely governed by NY Times comments. Harper has less than a third of Canada behind him, UKs Cameron even less. Only Merkel the most moderate may have the needed support of his people...We have had enough of war, so saber-rattling is out of place in the emerging world order of Globalization and Free Trade. In the past holding land was prized, in future knowledge and trade counts most. We should concentrate on improving the quality of our human capital to preserve our way of life that is in extreme danger as societal divisions grow to a yawn.","Putins sense of betrayal at the West shows he has been dreaming in Technicolor. He put too much faith in the our power, especially EU's, to dictate events worldwide even at its own doorstep...The wise and the strong not only recognize their own power and limits, but others weakness as well. Underestimating your foe is a blunder, but to over-estimate is worse. The weak will always betray you, the strong never...Wests Betrayal is because of its weakness, and Putin has over-estimated us. The increasingly polarized world is not what it was 30 years ago when Russia and America ruled the globe...On wider global terms the 2014 Ukraine crisis in a nutshell:..Losers: Ukraine, Russia, Nato, Israel, Saudi-Jihadi Islam.Winners: China, Iran, Turkey, non-Jihadi Islam","Isolationism is no longer a viable strategy it was in 19th century...As world economy morphs from past agrarian into future Free Trade and Globalization where uninhibited movement of goods, money, and people is must for success, our cutting links with others is shooting in our foot...100 years ago Corporate Capitalist West had every mastery over square inch of globe. Today, we are not welcome on 90 of it as our easily recognizable white citizens fear for their safety. By spurning white Russia we are even further limiting our access to a world that is already shrinking on us...Sanctions on Russia and writing off Putin will be a blessing in disguise for them as they will simply develop better links, more efficient sources for their inputs and technology, and larger markets for their goods in the rapidly growing BRICS, Asia, Latin America, and Africa...Rather than knee-jerk rue perhaps Mr. Obama should reflect first of the next generation he was elected to plan for. Is this the CHANGE the young voted for?","Two wrongs do not make 1 right. What Putin does in Crimea is wrong. What we did in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq, Libya was doubly wrong. ..There should be referendum not just in Crimea, but in the entire Ukraine. Also a referendum in Palestine. Also in Kashmir, not to speak of Quebec and Scotland. ..And I sincerely hope that all these referendums will go in favour of keeping the unit together so that none of these regions breaks up and cause more divisions and mayhem.

Toni Segarra,,,1,"The problem is not that it exclude Russia from the Group of 8 industrialized democracies, in its most exclusive club, to punish President Vladimir V.

And as we see the spread of the riots -the last in Madrid, where some police officers were defeated and wounded gravity - is working. That's the real problem: that medicine can be, or is worse than the disease.",,,,,,,,,
victor,,1,,"If it's there for the taking, he will take it. That has been his modus operandi and will continue to be so unless NATO forces are in place to confront him. As a de facto head of state for over 16 years, he epitomizes the slogan power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Grandiosity and paranoia inevitably become part of the package. Perhaps it would complicate the situation for him if we fostered a new front to contend with internally. You don't enter a boxing ring studying up on the Marquis of Queensbury rules if your opponent is entering the ring with a chain saw. Let's confiscate the assets of influential and super wealthy Russians instead of letting them enjoy the civil society protections here in the U.S. E.G. Prokhorov, owner of the NETS, Sharapova of tennis fame and Rybolovlev who bought the 88 M apartment for his college student daughter and then let's drag out the court proceedings for 10 years as Putin has done with trumped up charges against U.S. citizen Bill Browder. Revoke their visas and send these Russians home to celebrate the annexation of Crimea - or maybe decide they need to do something about the nut case that Putin has become..Simply put - turn-about is fair play.","I hope this works as a deterrence, but I would have preferred that we had acted a lot more aggressively a lot sooner and set the stage for deescalation. Besides honoring our NATO commitments with a military force, we should make direct statements warning Putin of grave consequences should he attack a NATO member. We should also confiscate properties of Russian citizens here in the U.S. - like the Prokhorovs, the Sharapovas, the 88 million condo Ryboloviev bought his 22 year old daughter in NYC, etc. - as Russia has done to Americans in Russia - e.g.Bill Browder. Revoke their visas and send them back home to Russia. We can then drag out the court proceedings for 20 years just as Putin has done. Let these influential Russians feel first hand the consequences of his policies and redirect them to confront their own in their homeland. Then, if Putin begins a de facto retreat of his aggression, we can respond in kind. But, carefully titrated increments like this risk only to embolden Putin as I doubt he has much respect for our resolve.","It is disgusting to read the moral flaccidity of false equivalences exhibited by so many of the comments regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Four bullets in the back (Putin learned that one is not enough in his failed attempt to assassinate the forward thinking Jewish mayor of Lviv, Gennady Kernes) or polonium is what these same people would be at risk if they should express such freedom of contrary thought in Russia. Be aware of the disinformation campaign that is central to Putin's strategy. It has been described by brave dissenters in Russia as being all about undermining the very process of rational discourse. E.G - from the NYT (<a hrefhttp:www.nytimes.com20140417worldeuropein-ukraine-russia-plays-a-weighted-word-game.html?emceta1) titlehttp:www.nytimes.com20140417worldeuropein-ukraine-russia-plays-a-weighted-word-game.html?emceta1) targetblank>http:www.nytimes.com20140417worldeuropein-ukraine-russia-plays-a...<a> -- Only 26 percent of those polled in the Donetsk survey wanted to join Russia or a resurrected Soviet Union, while more than 65 percent favored staying in Ukraine in one form or another. Such has been the success of resurrected Soviet era doublethink in distorting the very premises of coherent conversation as so much commentary seems to assume it is the will of eastern Ukrainians to want to join Russia.","Roger has it right. It has been obvious for a long time that peace negotiations have only served the purpose of decoy as Putin establishes facts on the ground. For those afraid of confrontation, the Sudetenland serves as a historical reminder as to the price of appeasement and empty promises on paper. The least the west can do against this aggressor is supply weapons to the Ukrainians to defend their country before Putin becomes increasingly megalomaniacal and goes after more and more. There should be no underestimating what is at stake here.","When Robert Gates was asked what he saw when he looked into Putin's eyes, he said An ice-cold killer. He got it right as opposed to W. who could never make sense of reality no matter how hard he tried. In my opinion, Czar PutinPresident Polonium is on the cusp of crazy dangerous with his retrograde nationalist zeal. So confrontation needs to be measured because it is possible this nut might push the red button and go down with the rest of the world to cement his place in history - or what's left of it. So I propose as the next step that all residential property owned by Russian citizens in the U.S be confiscated and the owners kicked out of the country and their visas revoked. Let them decide what they want to do with Putin when they get back home as he asks them to share in his celebration of the annexation of Crimea for the greater glory of Russia. Putin would of course be welcome to return the favor - except for one citizen - Snowden. He should be required to stay and ponder the real meaning of moral courage in standing up to his oppressors in his new homeland.","You exaggerate greatly Mr. Goldstein. For the 1002nd time Rusalka is right. The conversation containing a few bits of advice to our embassador regarding Ukraine's future took place in February - half a year after the grass roots movement began from within. The fuel and determination for this movement is 100 homegrown. If you want to point fingers at outside meddling, point them at Putin for threatening sanctions if Ukraine so much as signed a trade agreement with the E.U. And don't forget Russia's long tentacled history of abuse of Ukraine's populace going back to the Holodomor. In a just world they should be made to pay reparations.","In many ways Putin is again using his well documented modus operandi for those who dare to stand up and declare their independence from him in Ukraine. In the case of Litvinenko it was polonium - an insidious poison surreptitiously introduced into his food to rot the person from within. Or how about Yushenko and the dioxin he was poisoned by. In Ukraine he id doing something analogous - letting a toxic mix of disinformation, doublethink, disguised special forces and military armaments to seep into the country and undermine its quest to individuate and be free. Why does Putin harbor such venomous vindictiveness for those who stand-up independently and call him out. Well no doubt it has to do with the Faustian bargain of his own life - an impoverished childhood in St. Petersberg - wanting more and then throwing-in the towel to join the governing status quo via the KGB - the most cynical organization of all. So - yes, this loser who compensates with quarter million dollar mansions and absurd and empty grandiosities of greater Russia for what he lost long ago cannot stand to see others succeed where he has failed. In his mind they deserve a merciless slow death - not unlike the one he experienced in his soul as a child. He must not be allowed to succeed. Hopefully someone from within Russia will find a way to give him a taste of his own medicine.","Right-on William! And to that I would ad some what goes around comes around. The U.S. should confiscate Russian owned residential properties - the multimillion dollar condos, etc. and revoke the visas of the owners. And then drag out the court battles for 20 years. In the meantime they can return to Russia where the good-life awaits them, and Putin can offer them vodka to toast the annexation of Crimea for the greater glory of Russia. Nothing would provide greater poetic justice than for someone to do justice by Litvinenko by returning the favor in Putin's shot glass. As I said - what goes comes around is what is needed here.","As an American of Ukrainian heritage I want to thank the NYT for telling it like it is. I have been disgusted by the amount of armchair intellectualism I have encountered in the comments section over the duration of this crisis. It has been specious dot connecting in the service of false moral equivalences without any  authentic sense or understanding of the struggle for self determination -  equivalent to what our own American revolution was about - that reflects what this struggle means for the Ukrainian people. If the west stands for anything, it needs to stand up for Ukraine. Bravo to Merkel, Obama and the NYT for standing up for principle and not just selling out for economic expedience. A free Ukraine poses no threat to Putin except that its success would expose the errant ways of his backwards xenophobia thinking.","Bravo! I thank you for your on location insights into the heart and soul of the Ukrainian struggle. It is important for the rest of the world to hear and resonate with the conviction your writing communicates. There is a battle of wills taking place, and the outcome is not a foregone conclusion as so many of the detached and defeatist sounding fatalists in the comments section would have one believe. Russia is indeed acting out of weakness not strength. Putin is terrified of democracy, and he can't stand seeing the kinds of protests for self-determination he successfully squelches at home succeed so near by. As Pussy Riot so accurately stated of the Sochi Potemkin Village: It is built on corruption and run by suppression. - a microcosm of Russian society as a whole. Ukraine wants to escape this stifling sickness. If there is a will, there is a way, and the west needs to stand by the Ukrainians struggling to claim their destiny. It is comparable to our own American revolution. If we don't stand for these values, what do we stand for? We are not attempting to impose something from the outside here. This is about connecting to a home grown struggle for a real democracy. Let this situation bring out the best in who we are and what we stand for and let us be willing to make some measure of sacrifice in support of what is right."
Matt Vought,,1,,"I regard these sentiments as groundlessly defeatist - what is your evidence that Ukraine's military is weak and incompetent?  They are under equipped to be sure, but they have fought bravely against a much better equipped military force and have held a line.  There is no reason to believe that with better equipment and tactical support they could not make further inroads by the Russians too costly for Putin to consider wise.  I think that is really the mission in Easter Ukraine, at least at this point - prevent further Russian encroachment.",What a bracing and welcome tonic for the murky skullduggery of Putin's activities in Ukraine.,"I do not wish war, conflict, or harm to anyone, but I do not see how Putin could sit by and do nothing, as Crimea was to be absorbed by a hostile Kiev government. ..What are you talking about?  Crimea was the sovereign national territory of Ukraine.  Here's a few ideas about what Putin could have done: he could have honored the Budapest memorandum in which the US, Britain, and Russia pledged to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity in exchange for giving up their nuclear stockpiles; he could have assured the interim government in Kiev that he had Ukraine's back, and see to it that they had ample space and time to proceed with fair and monitored elections to put the country back on a path to democratic stability; he could have been a friend to Ukraine, honored his nation's moral and legal obligations to international agreements.  Give me strength - what could he have done?!!!","Using a rhetorical device such as To be fair is not an acknowledgement that the article is unfair.  It is a way of introducing a counterbalance, a sense of perspective to the concerns at issue.  ..The piece is important, and teases out some of the background for the puzzlingly unenthusiastic German response to Putin's naked aggression in Ukraine.  But I think it addresses, if only inadvertently, a broader response.  There is a substantial group of Americans who are not in the least troubled by Putin's Ukraine adventure - I take it you are one of them?  Conservatives are torn on this issue between admiring the open belligerence of Putin's foreign policy and finding finely calibrated economic sanctions unmanly and ineffectual - in effect looking for a more aggressive response.  But many American conservatives are moved by the same sentiments as German conservatives with regard to a Europe that has become too gay, too tolerant, too permissive in its morals and too un-Christian.  Even other posters here such as Albert have said they see nothing wrong with welcoming an authoritarian leader challenging Europe's fuzzy multilateralism.","@William Taylor - that is a tempting political theory.  I would venture to add that Putin is acting exactly like Hitler acted with regard to his arguments for annexation, and his expressed concern for enclaves of ethnically German peoples, or in Putin's case, threatened enclaves of ethnic Russians.  But there are important caveats that need to be pointed out.  Former Soviet vassal states joined NATO precisely because that affiliation gave them protection against the kinds of aggression we are now seeing play out in the Bloodlands.  This is not new furthermore - we saw previews in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and will doubtless see more of the same in other non-NATO aligned former Soviet states.  It is hard to regard the justification for appeasing despots like Putin as anything other than enabling.  Which came first, the burning grievances, or the aggressive actions?","Not worth paying attention to - the bogus narrative that Obama is being played by the wily and tough Putin is nothing more than the disloyal projection of those who hate Obama more than they love their country, and shows a numbing ignorance about the malignancy of Russia's actions in the region, and the damaging effects they have on geopolitical stability in Europe.","Actually that is not the case.  There is evidence of kidnapping and torture in Crimea, documented in this very paper: <a hrefhttp:www.nytimes.com20140416worldeuropeun-cites-abuses-in-crimea.html titlehttp:www.nytimes.com20140416worldeuropeun-cites-abuses-in-crimea.html targetblank>http:www.nytimes.com20140416worldeuropeun-cites-abuses-in-crimea...<a>..The abuse of power and the unleashing of a disastrously ill-advised invasion of Iraq by the US, which must in no way be minimized, should not prevent us from seeing the darkness and ill-intent of Russia's actions in Ukraine.  To claim that Putin enjoys anything remotely resembling a moral high ground is an absurdity of the highest order.","I think you have missed the point in your evident admiration of Hegelian dialectic.  This is not a game of intellectual virtuosity - real people's lives are being impacted here...The failure of the west to effectively stymie Putin's neo-Imperialism, on the other hand, and his efforts to shore up his near abroad may in part be chocked up to a Western naivete andor fecklessness about Russia's sensitivities vis-a-vis NATO expansion in the Baltic states, but is also, and more importantly about a poor set of options for the West, and a fundamental unwillingness to go to war over matters of secondary (no disrespect to Ukraine) geopolitical importance.  That does not accrue to Putin's cleverness; Putin may be crafty in the way of a 20th Century KGB officer, but I shake my head at his long game.  How does he imagine these widely reviled territorial maneuvers will benefit his posse of Oligarchs, not to mention the broader economy in Russia?  Power in the 21st Century is economic - everything flows from that.  This is a chess player who takes the piece exchange without realizing that by so doing, he is compromising his position of strategic strength on the board.","The security forces in Ukraine have had the temerity to challenge thinly disguised foreign aggression and a highly orchestrated campaign from Russia to destabilize the southeastern regions in Ukraine, prevent elections, and sow discord where none existed.  After the unrest which they created became an intolerable interference, and the central authorities have finally moved to quell dangerously escalating civil unrest and aggressive militaristic interference with regional stability, the Kremlin has the infuriating arrogance to warn Ukraine from enforcing its own internal stability.  Many posters here are nothing more than Kremlin hacks insisting on an entirely false account underwritten by a skillful and relentless propaganda initiative.  They are to be challenged and excoriated for their lies and for defending the violent bullying tactics of Vladimir Putin - a dark and entirely unnecessary threat to European stability.","I'm curious Dan, why you seem to instinctively side with Putin - quite evidently a swaggering geopolitical menace.  From playing a malign role in supporting the monstrous slaughter of the genocidal Assad in Syria, to brutal suppression of domestic political dissent, to legislation criminalizing homosexuality, his odious hand is felt everywhere his influence is exerted...No question America has much to answer for on the world stage, but in this drama, Putin seems quite clearly the aggressor and disingenuous thug, lying with a straight face to the entire world about the identity of what are obviously Russian soldiers seizing control in Crimea.  Why the Putin love?"
Yoandel,,,1,"And, just to tie NATO in knots, and to delay some more (while his military further makes gains and prepares for more action) yet ANOTHER Putin plan --but let's hand it out to Putin. Now Obama can say that his speech worked, Germany can relax, and Ukraine can continue to be invaded and, outgunned, lose more territory.","Frankly, defeat in Ukraine is to let Russia have the spoils. Even the most ardent supporters of Russia will tire unless Russia provides reconstruction, a booming economy, and jobs --something that Putin cannot deliver to Russia itself...Providing arms to Ukraine needs to be seen in context. The US is no longer a great superpower. Today the US confronts serious problems at home, and is challenged by an extremely unsettled world --from Yemen to Egypt, from Israel to Latin America, to China, Pakistan, and of course, our never-ending wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, are all extreme and expensive challenges...A direct conflict with Russia, and providing arms to Ukraine would mean this, can further add tremendous problems to the US. Today the US needs to confront unconventional enemies, adding a conventional one, and with nuclear weapons to boot is by no means in the interest of the United States. Victory over so many foes, no matter how great our country and how puny an enemy is in isolation, cannot be assured.","If the West does not step out and helps Ukraine recover economically, Mr. Putin will come back and restore his influence in Ukraine...Apparently, the US and Europe expect that the IMF will restore Ukraine's economy --but while the IMF's policies might work in a functioning country, as it is being proved in Greece, the IMF can create so much suffering and pain that Mr. Putin, I suspect, is simply going to wait and see --the IMF, and our deficit hawks might very well return Ukraine to him.","If Mr. Putin's military might translates in economic might, a rather doubtful proposition, then Russia and Crimea will be indeed resurgent. And, of course, the same applies to the US --no matter how impressive the armament on both sides...If the US, as Russia, insists in paying a military by going further into debt, the end result is a weakened nation...Truth be told, both the US and Russia's economics are a disaster, and so are their deficits and debt levels --neither of them, in spite of their muscle flexing, are true superpowers anymore.","As this crisis gets worse, we can begin to suspect that Russia and the separatists are playing a different game. The usual interpretation in the US and America is that Russia is encroaching on Ukraine incrementally, till it hits a point that results in sanctions and diplomatic anger that will make Russia stop --basically to maximize gain with a minimum of pain. In this view, Russia will certainly not go beyond some red lines for fear of losing customers and access to international markets...However, given Russia's latest response to the downing of this plane, the West needs to consider a different assessment. Though it might seem completely nuts to us, Mr. Puting might be willing to escalate this conflict to points unimaginable to the West (such as the downing of a civilian plane, now reach) and a direct conflict with NATO...The assumption has been that Russia still wants to be in the Western club. However, Mr. Putin's idea might be to force a much larger conflict, to solidify his czar-like powers at home, and to veer to a statist economy. While the US and the EU might think this unworkable and bad for Russia, a miscalculation might result in a much larger war than any of us could expect.","I am sure Putin sees himself winning both ways. If the Russia economy suffers, he will use discontent at home to further persecute his enemies and eliminate pluralism. If the economy holds, he will picture himself as a decisive leader, and advertise himself as smart and iron-willed...The problem, for the US, is that there is hardly any script to play for America. If the US pushes Russia to the brink, Putin will say he told his country so. If the US looks the other way, Putin will be emboldened...Yet at the end of the day, it will be for Ukraine and Russia to decide what happens next. We should wisely remove ourselves from problems that are not our own, are in no position of strength to influence decisively, and where no key US interests exist.","I am sure Putin sees himself winning both ways.

Putin implements peace in Eastern Ukraine, and Obama implements peace in the Middle East --removing support from all of the warring factions and sending peace-enforcing troops, and implementing a one person, one vote democratic solution and borders their inhabitants support.","Of course, and rightly so, much hand-wringing is occurring here in the West, but... we can ask, did the West provide for a comprehensive package of aid to Ukraine (as opposed to saying that Ukraine had to beg from the IMF?)...Mr. Putin is reading the tea leaves right... there might be a little bit of noise (less so, of any red lines) but Europe moved nary a finger to support the new government in Ukraine, and we very well know that the President cannot do anything --would, for example, our GOP not blame the President for whatever outcome? Much reduced by infighting, and a broke economy, we can only stand and watch.","The Russian nation may be motivated by a deep, creedal ideology that has been wafting through the culture for centuries.....Hmmm... you mean, like the exceptionalism that the US has claimed to snuff democracies in Central America, to intervene in the Middle East well knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, to invade an entire country to (unsuccessfully) grab a single crazed terrorist, or to kill innocent bystanders in Afghanistan because it became easier to send in the drones than to actually move troops and assert control of the terrain?..Mr. Putin's actions are excrescent, but, unfortunately, our behaviour has been less than stellar recently, and it sounds discordant to claim the moral high ground."

Vexray,1,,,"W Bush looked in Putin's eyes and saw Putin's soul - as Putin looked into W's. Maybe Putin saw how W wanted to expand the American empire to the middle east to export freedom and democracy, and he though he could do the same with Crimea. At least Putin seems to have done a better job, so far.","Listening to Putin's speech this morning, it was easy to buy his case on Crimea than BushCheney's case for invading Iraq.","How is it that Putin's land grab from Ukraine - considering past history, is such a big deal for the US and Europe, when the US in particular, is complicit in (with military aid) or looks the other way (with a few tsk tsks) when Israel grabs what the Palestinians claim was historically (and potentially for their future country on the West Bank) their land?..If might makes right for Israel in this era, why is it not so for Russia?",,,,,,,
Dr. Abramovich,,1,,"First off, who cares about the majority in the country-aggressor supporting the aggression? A rather cannibalistic argument, isn't it? Secondly, the so called referendum in Crimea was against the Ukrainian Constitution, arranged hastily after the peninsula has been quietly invaded by those mysteries little green man of Russian Spetsnaz , the Crimean Parliament forcible dissipated..We just recently had a wonderful chance to observe how referendums are conducted in civilized country; I mean of course the on in Scotland. Any similarity that you could point out to?.You, trolls, are indeed inundating the comments. But the Americans are no fools to blindly follow any propaganda. This is a free country of a free people..So, you valiant efforts will be wasted the same way people in the free world laugh at Russian diplomats in the UN and elsewhere; nobody takes seriously neither Mr. Putin's nor Mr. Lavrov's lies upon lies.","Deat HP, you could saved energy just by stopping after you wrote: Russiathe Putin government is not corrupt..I would've said more, but just a moment ago an alien ship landed in my backyard. Gotta go see what they want.","Disgusting indeed - you said it, not me! Disgusting and so much unfair to allege that the US in any shape or form provoked Putin's blatant aggression. Russia, quite undeservedly, was made a member of the G-8, she enjoyed substantial Western investments, had excellent working relationship with the EU until, according to you, came this big bad US with it's uncalled for provocations so that poor, peaceful little KGB lieutenant colonel had no choice but to grab a large chunk of a sovereign country territory and start a little hybrid war. Isn't it disgusting?","One can only hope that we should never come to war with Russia but (what a rare occasion it is!) I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Cohen in that the West must help Ukraine at least by arming it. Already thousands of Ukrainians lost their lives, how many more will have to perish before US and EU finally realize that Putin will not be able to conceal from the population significant losses that would inevitably result from fighting with a better equipped Ukrainian army. And he cannot afford disclosure of such potential losses which would critically damage his popularity among the people and the strong position he has been enjoying on the top of the ruling Junta.","As always most of the comments to any topic related to the Russian aggression against Ukraine are written by the Putin's hired hands or those who Lenin called useful idiots. This blood-hungry raging bear must be stopped or, after consuming the almost bankrupted by the corrupt previous governments Ukraine, the bear will not be satisfied and will look for new victims and territories..I appeal to all American readers of the comments to keep it in mind and not to conclude that a majority of readers is against helping Ukraine. Any statistics here will be significantly skewed (for a good example peruse comments to a recent Thomas Friedman article here).","Your cheap shot at Mr. Poroshenko's name aside.(dropping 'h' in the name make it sound like, say, Pigson and I'm sure MrMs Myliugamta did it intentionally) aside, it is worth mentioning that unlike Mr. Putin himself and his rubber stamp parliament - Duma Mr. Poroshenko has been elected democratically.

Therefore, it is rather clear who are puppets and who's their puppeteer.","Who are you, R.L.? It is a well known fact that Russian propaganda machine has been flooding U.S. media with their pro-Putin comments. Yours as well as the one below supposedly written by a Mr. Dmitri Ivanov below and probably many more, I have not yet any but the first three comments here. I appeal to every American reading these comments: regardless of your political affiliation, please, disregard the resurrected Soviet era propaganda when forming your opinion on the matter!.And YES - Putin probably does not have full control over the rebels (though many Russian citizens including those who came from Chechnya are among them), but is he indeed wanted to stop the fighting he would've accomplished it within a week","Fellow Americans, Mr. Mikheev is a provocateur, a small cog in the giant Putin's propagandadisinformation machine. Therefore, please, do not believe a single word in his comments..Those of us who read much on the subject, could've noticed the amazing fact: even the Belarus dictator Lukashenko, the closest Putin's ally, recognized the Ukrainian Provisional Government  and does not support the enormous Russian propaganda campaign..Meanwhile the Russian so called Parliament (Duma) daily rubberstamps laws that directly contradict their Constitution, severely limiting the freedom of speech, blocking access to the few remaining opposion internet sites, etc.  The saddest feature of the current aggression against Ukraine is the incredible wave of the jingoistic enthusiasm of the vast majority of the Russian population. The Fuehrer - Putin (or Putler as he is often called by the opposition) - enjoys a 70-80 support and encouraged to expand his aggression and occupy Eastern and Southern Ukraine..Our Government, our allies, all democratic countries must be united and strong in keeping the maximum pressure on Russia. We must remember, that Putin's strongest tool - Europe's dependence on his natural gas and oil supplies - is double-edged: Russian economy will collapse without the fuel revenues. The world does not fall for Putin's propaganda efforts; not a single country supported Russia in the UN Security Council!",
Rohit,1,,,"It isn't obvious and it is not true.   I myself have looked at the history of the Ukraine crisis and is clear that the West is indeed to blame...But maybe to blame is too strong a language in that the West is still interested in destroying any rival power in Eastern Europe.  Ukraine is a willing pawn in this project, unaware that  pawns can be sacrificed...America's current rule is Either you are a follower or you are an enemy and we will undermine you. And maybe Russia CAN been undermined.   I doubt that China can be.   And a weakened Russia may decide to side with China...There are dangers in the Western policy of encircling Russia and using bad Putin as their excuse.   Don't go there. The prize is not worth the risk.  Give up Crimea and give autonomy to east  Ukraine and we are all home free.  ..Putin has made it amply clear that these are his modest goals, NOT Russian troops in Warsaw.","James, there is no denying that many people in Kiev, probably most, hate Putin and perhaps Russia as well.  And Kiev is where you conducted your survey...But you do have to go to Crimea or to Donetsk to find out what the Russian speaking minority in the former Ukraine thinks.  There has been a lot of emigration from Ukraine after the recent troubles.  And most of that emigration has been to Russia.  Clearly some people have a different view of Russia from the views of people in Kiev...That says something to me.   I hope it says something to you as well.","The question was never if but when.  In some ways it would have been in Russia's interest to leave Crimea a part of Ukraine and hope that all the pro-Russia voters in Crimea would  see to it that the government in Kiev was friendly to Russia...It looks like Putin has decided to cut his losses and take half a loaf.  I do not see a way for him to  absorb East Ukraine, with a lot of Russian speakers, as well...The West could play a constructive role here, try to ask that the rights of Tatars and Ukrainian speakers in Crimea are respected and offer a complementary respect in Ukraine for Russian speakers.  Also, strict military neutrality for Ukraine is a must...A gentler Putin and a more intelligent Obama could arrive at such an arrangement, but Obama lacks intelligence and Putin lacks gentleness, so my hopes are on the dim side.","This talk about Hitler is nonsense.  When there is a dispute, each party tries to exaggerate the intentions of the other side.   Obama wants to turn America into a communist country,  The Republicans want women to be barefoot and pregnant are such gambits whose purpose is to discredit the other side but have little basis in reality.  Putin as Hitler is another such piece of hysteria in which Hillary. to her eternal discredit, has joined...There is no evidence that Putin seriously plans to take over Eastern Europe and even Eastern Ukraine, which has lots of Russians, is going to be difficult for him to try and absorb...His problem is going to be to prevent Ukraine from mistreating Russian speakers in East Ukraine.    Their lives will not be in danger, but their rights may be.  ..Hopefully, once the West gets over its whining, some accommodation can be worked out which will make sure that Tatars and Ukrainian speakers in Crimea, and Russian speakers in Ukraine proper can live in peace and well being...And for that to happen, the West has to give up its hysteria about Hitler and try to engage in a constructive dialog.  Putin may not respond, but the West has not tried, have they?..I myself have a Russian speaking friend who lives in Ukraine but he is more interested in spirituality than in politics.","I don't you if you noticed it but rocodileis a good analogy.  It is not a beast that is dangerous if you stay on land.  It only becomes dangerous if you go into ITS domain.  ..Lots of readers here can see that the US has been very provocative towards Russia, and while Putin may not be the nicest man on the planet, almost all of his moves have been measured and moderate.  As he said once, Russia troops could be in Kiev in two weeks.  But they have not budged westward...Putin's entire strategy is to protect Russia's access to Sevastopol and protect the rights of the Russian speaking minority in Ukraine.  By threatening these the US has forced him to react.  Why not accept that these are reasonable goals backed even by Gorbachev?..It is precisely because Putin is not a nice man that I think this is a dumb move.  It may lead to escalation and who knows what comes next...It is far better to send the message, We understand your concerns and will not attack you if you promise safety for Poland and the Baltic nations.  THAT could result in a deal.  Saber rattling is dangerous when both sides have sabers.","Why not read Putin's own words?..I think that only an insane person and only in a dream can imagine that Russia would suddenly attack NATO,..The West claims that Russian troops have been in East Ukraine for months.  If this is true, then should we not take seriously the fact that they have not budged even a mile eastward?..You take a situation in which Russia is pretty much doing nothing, pretend (with zero evidence) that they are becoming aggressive  and bring troops and weapons close to them.  It is madness.","Putin's soldiers took Crimea with virtually no opposition..Because that is what the people of Crimea wanted.    I doubt that Warsaw would go nearly the same way...What is needed here is not military strategy but a common sense understanding that military strategy is not needed and might be harmful...By the West's own claims, Russian troops have been in Eastern Ukraine for months and they have not moved eastward.  These are not acts of aggression.  It is the US which is constantly committing aggression and leaving its own bridges in a state of disrepair,","It is more than that.  When Putin said that Russian, Ukrainian AND Tatar would be the official languages of Crimea, he was extending an olive branch...Now if the West could just stop calling him Hitler or invader and start a constructive dialog, that would be great...Perhaps the BRIC countries could step in and say, We don't accept the nonsense coming from Washington and the EU.  ..We need to think about the happiness of the PEOPLE of Ukraine and Crimea and stop all this nonsense about the national sovereignty of an unelected government in Kiev.","We need to start with what the West did.  If I step on  your corn and you curse me, I cannot just say Look he cursed me out of nowhere.  The West managed the overthrow of an elected government in Kiev and replaced it with a government hostile to Russia.  This WAS aggression..The West has practiced slow but steady aggression towards Russia through expansion of NATO,  and now we are seeing the results.  Calling Putin Hitler is not going to take away his nuclear weapons nor is it going to do away with the fact hat the aggression first came from us...It is, as you say, a dangerous situation and what I would ask from the NY Times board is not hysteria but wisdom.  No matter what the Republicans think the days when the US could call all the shots are gone.   The US needs to work with other nations...And working with other nations implies seeing the world through their eyes,..Please, please, NY Times, act like adults!","JP You mean the Soviet Union lost a lot when it lost the Cold War. ..What you are saying is that RussiaUSSR was weak and what the West took was winner's spoils.  It seems that Russia has learned the lesson that might makes right and their 40,000 Russian troops will ensure that Russia will be heard...As for NATO being purely a defensive pact, tell that to the Afghans who see NATO troops in their country without ever having invaded any NATO country...The West is teaching the world that might makes right.  Gorbachev did not see this but Putin has been a better student at the West's school."
Bruce,,1,,"Unfortunately, arming the Ukrainians would be a mistake.  Anything we do, Putin could easily trump. His supply lines are short, ours are long. Logistics favor the Russians: it's in their backyard. Our national interests or security are not at stake. Putin knows this and so do we.  At best, we are stuck with muddling through with sanctions, diplomacy and making clear to Putin that Poland and the Baltic states are a very different matter..We must leave Putin's ultimate fate to his management of a declining petro state, a 3rd rate economy and his growing isolation from the modern integrated world economy. In the end, if the Soviet Union was Austin Power's Dr Evil, alas, Putin's role is to be  Mini-me.","They lost an empire, these Russians you speak of and it was done without the traditional ways of losing an empire, that is through wars.  Nonetheless their pride remains, and has morphed into this crazy nationalism, and as Mr Cohen states absolutism, whatever that means.  ..As for decadence, it draws light and heat which guides humanity with tolerance, something Mr. Putin should consider.","As one commenter asserted accurately, This is a tempest in a teapot..Crimea is historically and ethnically Russian. The populace speaks Russian, and by news reports from the first day's of this situation, Crimea's population aligns with Russia, not Ukraine. Khrushchev's giving Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 was a political error, not a melding of two common regions. Putin re-acquired Crimea for Russia using heavy-handed, unilateral Russian thug tactics. We don't like it. But does it matter much to the U.S., or to Europe, or of any vital or national security interest? No. Does it violate our values? Perhaps, but then how much have we honored our professed valuesthe latest example to be Iraq in 2003?.As for this being a struggle between Obama and Putinit's nothing of the kind. Putin didn't consider the U.S. president in his calculations. His tunnel vision is focused on re-establishing as much as possible a Russian empire. Obama challenged Putin because he's the instigator and leader of a country being reckless and violating our values. Obama recognizes the limited importance of Putin's behavior, especially what little we can actually do about, but has condemned Putin's actions, and has taken steps to punish the Russian actors involved. That's a mature, appropriate and assertive response..People, stop making these events as being a Rocky-like U.S.-Soviet boxing match, with a zero-sum result. Russian lost credibility, integrity and trust; the US benefitted.","This may be a case of 'be careful of what you ask for, you might get it.'  Reports out of the Crimea are saying that the economy is at a standstill, the assimilation into Russia is not going well.  It may take a decade and billions to make the Crimea a functioning part of Russia.  So  go ahead Mr. Putin absorb another section of the Ukraine that is a walking corpse; we won't have to worry about Russia for awhile, they will be too busy trying to keep their country a float after getting exactly what they asked for.",It looks like Mr. Putin is finding out the consequences of trying to ride a tiger.  Its all fun and games at the start but then things turn on you in a hurry.  To quote the rock group GNR Welcome to the jungle.,"With Putin giving The Rebels sophisticated weapons-something like his was eventually bound to happen, And it definitely did.",Apparently Putin is  mirror who reflects the worldview of those who view him. Commenters and commentators alike seem to look at the exact same set of facts and then tally up there interpretive score in the game of GOP vs. Dems. Douthat resists that urge and instead lays out the reality that Putin is doing what he thinks is best for Russia while actually causing more harm to the world.,"The reasoning in the op-ed is a rather poorly argued attempt to move the ethics of the ongoing discussion towards what we need to give Putin to go away. But why give the aggressor anything? Russia needs to lose its Black Sea port, and leave Crimea. That would be a fair punishment for trampling on another nation's sovereignty without due or perceived cause. Iraq or Afghanistan are irrelevant in this discussion, since we are taking a moral road not an imbecilic one. ..But more than that: I have come to suspect that the litany of responses in support of the op-ed come significantly from Russia itself -- the logic is faulty in the way one would suspect from Russians trying to make an anti-western point, where you might suspect westerners to make more salient western-style argument against further involvement etc etc.","What hasn't been mentioned, outside of comments following commentary and editorials, is that we, the U.S.A., damaged badly any moral and political higher ground we could aspire to regarding Russia's and Putin's actions because of our illegal, morally indefensible, and national-security fabrications, related to our invasion of Iraq. Who are we to challenge, much less dictate, to Russia what they can and cannot do, about territory bordering themUkraine and Crimeain which live ethnic Russians and Russian defense installations..What's happening in Ukraine and Crimea are unfortunate, but of little real interest of ours, and certainly not of national security interest. We can and should help the Ukrainian government and citizens with financial support.

Indrid Cold,,1,,"Vladdy Putin is a textbook example of someone suffering from little man syndrome. His dwarfish appearance has led him to overcompensate in virtually every aspect of his life. Judging by his numerous publicity photos showing him engaging in all kinds of manly activities, it is clear that he suffers from a deep seated need to be seen as virile and strong, I would not be surprised if his sexual equipment is also much smaller than average. Every aspect of Putin's behavior points toward overcompensation. Unfortunately, this may very well lead to political miscalculation where Russia's military adventures are concerned. Nevertheless, I suspect that Putin will be forcibly removed from office at some point in the near future.","But they WILL blink. The Putin regime is populated by insanely wealthy Russian mobsters. They have been living like kings since the collapse of the Soviet empire. They have no real quarrel over Ukrain, and are not about to risk nuclear annihilation simply to save Putin's pride. Given an eyeball to eyeball confrontation with the U.S., they wil force Putin to blink even if it means killing him. The Russian elite are only concerned that the beluga caviar keeps coming.","As I recall, the Soviets did, in fact, blink during the Cuban crises. I also recall that the Russian military machine was roughly as inferior to the West's military might as we see today. Much of the Russian strategic arsenal is in an advanced state of decrepitude. They rarely deploy their ballistic missile submarines (due to their nasty habit of spontaneous combustion), and their bomber fleet is something right out of a WWII magazine (propellers!) That leaves their strategic rocket forces as their remaining deterrent. Many of these weapons are in serious need of maintainance, and many more would be vulnerable to the ABM systems already fielded in Eastern and Western Europe. What really makes the argument academic, is the fact that Russia's oligarchy is not about to risk the cushy lifestyle they have enjoyed since the breakup of the Soviet Union. I do believe they would remove Vladdy Putin if they thought he was going to fight a nuclear war with the U.S.","There is another very important difference between the Russia of today, and the Soviet state of the 21st century. The US is now on the verge of being able to deploy a ballistic missile shield by using the Ruusian border states as ABM bases. Current and near future placement of the proper equipment on Russian borders, will enable the complete neutralization of Russia's land based tactical and strategic rocket forces. This will essentially render Russia's nuclear arsenal obsolete. Once this has occurred, America's vastly superior stealth aircraft and drones will be free to overfly and undertake missions within Russian airspace at will, without having to fear an escalation to nuclear war. Bad actors within Russia will then be as vulnerable as ,say, a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. Little pocket-dictators like Putin will be exactly where they need to be. Boxed in by American superior weaponry and technology.","What most people do not realize (and what scares Russia to death) is that the US could easily execute a politically decapitating military strike on Russia using a combination of tactical (low yield) nuclear weapons and advanced stealth aircraft that would complete their missions before Moscow had any inkling of what had happened. There wouldn't be a single retaliatory shot fired by Russia because they would have no high ranking commanders with the means to issue the necessary orders..Russia's early warning radar and satellite systems have been effectively half blind for over a decade (the product of Russian corruption and neglect within its military industrial complex) and exposes huge expanses of its boarder to unanswered attack. Were it deemed necessary to do so, the US could easily eliminate the ability of Russian to govern, without taking so much as a single domestic hit. Regardless of how many shirtless pictures Vlad Putin publishes in his propagandist news organizations, he could be soundly spanked like the oversized infant he resembles.",,,,,

What he says means nothing.","This is pure Putin - throw out a useful sounding offering right before NATO gathers, thereby weakening the impetus to further punish Russia economically. Three days from now Putin will be back in bellicose form.","Why is Obama,  our Commander of the armed forces,  sitting on the sidelines?   The last time a president did nothing (remember Jimmy Carter), Americans were held hostage and we were humiliated around the world.  It's time to step up to the plate and show Putin and all of the other aggressor dictators out there that America stands for freedom for all,  wherever you live.",I believe the author of another NYT article this morning has predicted the most likely outcome- that Putin has stepped into  Middle East doo-doo of the worst type. He could have no effective strategy because there's too many players to deal with. Bombing is not a strategy which will change the situation. Obama is correct in all of his responses to the Arab Spring which has turned into the Arab nightmare.  Putin has rushed into the caldron where angels fear to tread.,"It is very clear that Mr. Putin has a goal of taking a significant part of eastern Ukraine. Perhaps he feels that it should be part of Russia again...as it has been in the past. At any rate, he knows that if he takes it piecemeal, and with pretense at wanting a diplomatic solution he has a very high probability of success, since only military intervention by significant powers would hinder him.  Sadly, no such intervention is likely in the foreseeable future for Ukraine.","Argue all you want about clear language, the real story I see is the fact that Europe is so energy dependent on Russia that NATO countries will limit how far they will go to deal with Putin. The majority of Eastern Ukraine does not want to join Russia, and Putin undoubtedly knows this.  Sure he likes to mess around, but if he keeps playing with fire, some powerful Russians who want to make more money will get tired of him and if he doesn't listen to them, he will increasingly become more vulnerable.   Economic interdependence will have the final say.","The USA should not spend any more effort or take any more risks to save Ukraine from Putin than the EU, especially Germany, are willing to do. If Germany and the others care more about their business interests than keeping Ukraine a free democracy than so be it.","What's the US's strategic interest in this mess?

I'll let other upper-middle-class eager beavers become instant experts for the edification of their dinner companions this week.","Putin's governing framework is 20th century nationalism, which is sorely unsuited for the 21st century. In this century, leaders who lower national boundaries enrich their nations; leaders who raise national boundaries impoverish their nations."
abo,1,,,"Instead of this amateurish psychoanalysis, the NYT would do much better to publish in its entirety the extremely lucid speech by Putin setting forth his reasons for the Crimean annexation: <a hrefhttp:praguepost.comeu-news37854-full-text-of-putin-s-speech-on-crimea titlehttp:praguepost.comeu-news37854-full-text-of-putin-s-speech-on-crimea targetblank>http:praguepost.comeu-news37854-full-text-of-putin-s-speech-on-crimea<a> The NYT's masters in Washington probably don't permit it, but one can always hope. It also should be noted that Putin has answered questions, often hostile, from the press. If Obama ever decides to answer questions, you can be sure he will be tossed the sure-coated ones the American press generally throw.",In another article on this subject (one which does not accept comments) the first sentence reads: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia might have hoped that American lawmakers and officials targeted for reciprocal sanctions on Thursday would respond with fear or outrage.  Are Americans really this delusional?  Or is just NYT reporters?  Or does the NYT get brownie points with their masters in Washington by writing such tripe?  Any thinking person over the age of 5 would understand that Putin did not have that hope.,"Perhaps the reason Putin doesn't respect the U.S. is that it sees it for the hypocrite which it is. America's nvasion of Iraq (cheerleaded by Mr. Friedman)? No problem, sovereignty doesn't matter! Drones from the sky in Pakistan? America has the right to defend itself! His international norm phrase was cute, because in Mr. Friedman's mind apparently, America establishes the norm, so it can do what it wants. America may have bought off European leaders, but there are many Europeans who can see what America really is: a hypocritical bully with no moral authority in this, or any other, world.",,,,,,,
Uuuu,1,,,"Here you go -- I'm sure Putin is 100 right, this is indeed not the war for us.. I would not say the same thing in 1938 (but that is me talking 76 years later).. AND You betcha I would rather wait until it IS my war.. - you don't just jump into not your war.. silly question really..",I don't think the White House is interested in such an investigation.. -- it's too uncertain -- it may come out this way or that way -- a proper investigation should not even assume that it was a rocket that destroyed the plane.. Obama though is not interested in that -- he finally got something working for him -- blame Putin and people will cheer.. why stop now,"Military interventions is not going to work.. Do we even know our enemy there? Do we even have a goal? Like what? take over Ukraine and push the Russians back to Russia? Do you stop at the Russian border or keep going? What will be then the difference between Putin's and Obama's actions? Even if the whole Europe, the whole world joins us - what will be the difference between that and what Putin is doing now?","I think, the United States of America should ignore the fact that Yatsenyuk was appointed the Prime Minister as a result of the coup.. Just give the money to Ukraine.. Whomever is the leader there.. Just borrow some more from China and give it to Ukraine.. Future generation of Americans will gladly repay it back to China.. Right now the most important thing is to stop Putin at whatever the cost to the US. We don't care if our quality of life does not improve or even if it goes down AS LONG AS it gets worse in Russia too! Anything to make Putin and his friends pay!.. We'll pay now, he'll pay later.. Because, you know, we are ok with undemocratically ruled Ukraine.. But Russia - undemocratically ruled Russia - that! is our biggest pain.. That! is the place where we must spread Freedom and Democracy.. Imagine how much this will annoy Putin! He'll be so angry.. He will not even notice that we destroyed our own country to make him pay..",,,,,,
Alexander  K.,1,,,"This was a problem created by the myopic US foreign policy, still stuck somewhere in the 1980s.  Western anti-Russian rhetoric played perfectly into Putin's hands by helping him to whip up Russian nationalism and providing the excuse for his failed economic policies and corruption.  Now Putin will present himself as the savior (or at least a major player) in the Middle East, which was stirred up into the current disaster by the ill-advised and even worse executed US invasions.","Mr. Friedman presents an ossified, neocon view that tries to simplify the world to black and white, good and evil, something shocking enough for the American people to understand...The fact is that Russia and Ukraine are Siamese twins from the same parent, and share their values.  Ukraine, the smaller of the two, is speaking the language of the West using worlds like 'democracy'.  Yet, it is an extreme oligarchy just like Russia.  Ukraine blames Russia for its inability to reform (unclear why, but it fits the neocon narrative), and Russia blames the West for its economic troubles. (Ironically, the oligarchy state is exactly the Republican vision for the US).  ..In fact, everything is following a very predictable script that was obvious at the very beginning.  Ukraine is more important to Russia than it is to the West.  Furthermore, Western reactive policies have only played into Putin's hand whose popularity has only gone up.  ..The best thing we could do is to step aside and not make things worse.  Russia is not the Soviet Union, and is but a diminutive power.  Yet, it presents more threat as an outcast it has become, allying itself with Iran and China.","However distorted the Russian vision of this conflict may be, so is Mr. Cohen's.  This conflict is full of gray, and both sides are trying to make it black and white.  Change Putin's cost-benefit analysis!  How about cost-benefit analysis for the civilians caught in the middle of all this who are the primary victims?  How about some vision and long-term cost-benefit analysis for the US?  ..The ideal way to have dealt with this conflict from the start, would have been through free, local elections under international observation.  The Eastern and Western Ukraine have different histories, language preferences, and ethnic identities.  It was always a divided state put together by the Soviets.  It was going to be trouble from the very beginning.  True democracies try to solve problems by elections.  Instead, when the US looks at Russia it sees the red cape and wants to go to war just like an angry (but stupid) bull with a comparable cost-benefit analysis.","None of the players in this story are free of responsibility...1.  The rebels, who probably did it, are obviously directly responsible..2.  Putin is responsible for flaming this conflict using local and mercenary non-professional forces, who are obviously limited in their intelligence and sophistication.  That can only bring about disaster sooner or later..3.  Ukraine is responsible for allowing flights over its territory.  Ukraine cannot have it both ways.  If Ukraine maintains sovereignty over the Eastern territory, it should not be allowing civilian planes through in the first place.  Ukraine knows rebel's capabilities.  Ukrainian military planes were shot down previously.  Ukrainian government calls the rebels terrorists.  Therefore, Ukraine is responsible.  Were they hoping for some tragedy to happen?.4.  The US and the West, by pointing fingers at one side are clearly taking sides itself, which means they are part of the conflict and are not entirely innocent either...Both Russian and Ukrainian governments should call a ceasefire and let people come in and collect what may be left of their loved ones remains.  The rebels should respect that and demonstrate some basic humanity.","The Ukrainian response choices to this convoy attempt are the following:..1.  Block the convoy.  Trapped citizens of Eastern Ukraine will not see the Ukrainian Army as their protectors and liberators.  The Russian population will be further convinced that the West is against them.  Putin will have an excuse to invade to save the trapped people...2.  Allow the convoy.  Trapped citizens of Eastern Ukraine will see Russia, not Ukraine or the West, coming to their aid.  ..Either way, it is a losing choice for Ukraine.  However, if the convoy is turned away and Russia does not intervene, we'll know that Putin was bluffing all along.","1.  Western standing up to Mr. Putin has only helped Mr. Putin's hold on power and silenced Russia's feeble democratic voices...2. It is difficult for the West to make pro-democracy arguments to Russians given that it did not wish to listen to the wishes of the mostly Russian population of Crimea.  True, their post-annexation elections were a farce.  However, there is little doubt the province did not want to be Ukrainian (1991 Crimean elections were reasonably fair, but were negated by Kyiv)...3.  It is also difficult for America to promote democracy in the world given the circus that it has on display among its presidential candidates.  ..If the US wishes to see democracies thrive in the world, it needs to fix its own.  Democracy should be about contests of ideas and character, not about money, disinformation, and marketing.","The comments are incredibly naive.  Putin didn't blink.  The so-called sanctions never had a chance of working.  If anything, all the noise only helped Putin's ratings at home, while further diminishing his opposition.  The much touted UN condemnation was merely a demonstration of who rules the world today (the US and EU).  However, all the BRICS countries abstained, except Russia that voted 'no'.  None of the emerging powers are fond of the US being on top, and Western posturing is only bringing them into a closer alliance.  Putin is playing a long chess game, while the West is simply being reactive.  We can't win in a game like this.  We need to grow up and think a couple moves ahead.  If we don't, it is the West that will ultimately end up marginalize.  I am not sure that will be a better world.","The failures of the US foreign policy stem from complete lack of a long-term vision.  It is often dictated by short-term interests and rather special interests at that.  It is reactive.  It is poorly informed, too often using black and white distinctions where grey is the dominant color...It is time to introduce a new doctrine.  Foreign policy should be constructed with one most fundamental principle -- first and foremost support the interests of the local people.  That requires understanding and respect of these people, something the American foreign policy makers too often lack.  The Ukrainian story is just one of many examples where every interest has been considered, except that of the local people most affected.  Poroshenko and the West are definitely doomed to failure in Eastern Ukraine, and so is Putin because he also doesn't care about the actual people.","I doubt the Russians are as worried about the markets as the Americans and the Europeans.  Their economy is already in very bad shape.  They want dignity, and they see it in their old Russian Empire.  The Ukranian economy is in even worse shape, and the Ukranians want their own dignity.  They see it in a 46-million strong, bread-basket, industrial base of the old Soviet Union -- a mini-empire within the empire.  The two people are not that different.  Both have long history of oppression, both have an inferiority complex, and neither has much experience in having a civil society...The Western sabre rattling is only encouraging Putin to demonstrate his strength and represents a confirmation of his narrative of Russia surrounded by enemies.  Frankly, I don't even think Obama's threats of costs are directed toward Putin (I hope Obama is not that ignorant of the situation).  Rather, this tough talk is merely meant to demonstrate some veneer of toughness to the Republicans.","I doubt the Russians are as worried about the markets as the Americans and the Europeans.

JerseyJeff,,1,,"After hearing Putin's speech, I am very bothered in how Russia is trying to draw a similarity to the Kosovo War...The Kosovo War had already become a humanitarian disaster by the time intervention began in October 1998 with 250,000 Albanian refugees and knowledge of massacres of Albanian Muslims was already known. After Serbia surrendered in 1999, the UN led the occupation for 8 years before the UN recommended Kosovo be split from Serbia...Russia, on the other hand, intervened to protect persecuted Russian speakers in Ukraine without any victims to justify a military invasion and occupation of Crimea.  Once the Russian Army occupied Crimea, within a little over a week Russia is annexing Crimea into the Russian Federation from Ukraine.  That is not the same at all and has nothing to do with self-determination but rather a justification of using the Russian military to expand Russian borders...The example of Kosovo doesn't fit well at all into Russian actions, but fits rather well with the actions of The Third Reich in annexing the Sudetenland and the Anschluss with Austria...This isn't self-determination, this is fascism...Russia could have brought the issue of Crimea up in a legal and legitimate way through the United Nations and through negotiations with Ukraine's new government after May 25th, but instead decided to use the Russian Army to grow Russian Federation territory while barely making an effort to put a gloss of legitimacy on Russia's actions.","Nobody is concerned if it will change Russia's mind if Putin will stay the course no matter what happens...It becomes about punishment and destabilizing Russia itself, making further territorial expansion difficult to implement as well as damage the ability of Putin's mafiaocracy from functioning.",Putin's only success for Russia was first being elected as oil prices began to rise from the 10pb lows of the 1990's.,,,,,,,

Ex-criminals ( or not ex) and terrorists look much more good than Putin in your eyes??? Come on, it is time to understand, that USA isn't always right.","As a European I approve Russia's intervention in Syria. Russia is interested in fighting ISIS because it is struggling with muslim extremists itself and is worried that ISIS could spread into Russia. I don't think that the US strategy to fight ISIS and Assad at the same time was promising. It was hard to see where the priorities are. I am convinced that Russia can handle Assad - at least Syria has been a stable state under Assad for many years. Also, if Russia succeeds in Syria this will most probably improve relationships between US and Russia. I am quite certain that Putin's intervention in Syria was a deal between Obama and Putin because Obama realized that he will not win this fight. So Putin helped the US to save its face.

alan brown,1,,,"The question is not what we want but what can be had that resolves this crisis without war and with a united Ukraine.  We would want (but can't get) a united Ukraine, allied economically and militarily with the west. What we can get is a united Ukraine with a completely autonomous east and south Ukraine with that section having close relations with Russia and western Ukraine being neutral and friendly with the west and Russia. This will have to be negotiated. There is no alternative. Yes, Putin has a lot of nerve demanding that Ukraine withdraw its forces from eastern Ukraine but the military realities are what they are and an invasion by Russia will result in the slaughter of those troops. This cannot be compared to Hitler and Chamberlain. Putin is an untrustworthy despot but he is no Hitler. President Obama, although late in realizing what was happening, has been saying and doing all the right things.","The problem we have is that Putin has history and geography on his side. Ukraine borders Russia, not US or Germany. Crimea separated from Russia by a small strait. Crimea was, in fact, part of Russia and USSR until gifted (without referendum) in 1952 to Ukraine when Ukraine was part of USSR. While Kosovo's decision to break from Serbia may not be a perfect analogy it is close enough and we supported it. Not for nothing Romney was ridiculed when, in debates, he argued Putin and Russia were main geo-political foes of US. Our President, however, is handling a hot potato well by not over-reacting. Hopefully, after annexation of Crimea, Russia and Ukraine can begin negotiations and arrive at some mutually beneficial arrangement. It may not satisfy either side but that's life.","What's the saying war is diplomacy  by another name? The solution to this is negotiations on the degree of autonomy granted to eastern Ukraine while keeping that region in Ukraine. The talks will play out by virtue of Russia's superior military might and its readiness to use it and the degree to which sanctions by the west hurt Russia. A ceasefire is the way to begin. The President of Ukraine, the separatists and Putin will weigh all this but no one needs a resumption of killing for these factors to be clarified.",Both sides see history from their perspective. It is not likely that either side will change. Therefore a peaceful settlement will require Russia and Putin to abandon the idea of annexing eastern Ukraine whether it calls it old or new Russia and Ukraine must accept that this region will have to be granted a sufficient degree of autonomy to satisfy Russians in that region and Russia. It is the art of diplomacy to get both sides to recognize this. The alternative is for a Russian invasion and annexation of further territory. The simple fact is that Russian forces hold the upper hand militarily and the USEU?NATO are not about to send troops to repel an invasion. That would be called WW3. A move by Russia to invade would be reprehensible but words don't count for much in this mess.,Crimea is now part of Russia and anyone who thinks Russia will return it is delusional and out of this world. Obama should take the off ramp being offered by Putin to tamp down the tensions and talk. The talks should concern negotiations between Ukraine and Russia so that this thing doesn't go any further. No more jokes from Putin and no more sarcasm from our President like calling Russia  a regional power Some regional power with enough nukes to annihilate us. What we need now is diplomacy.,"Very few doubt that Putin is a despot, that he has not been democratically elected, and that human rights of many groups are violated in Russia. When the security of Russia is threatened it should have been anticipated that he would move to restore it. We have done the same in too many places to itemize. Right now he has done the right thing by calling Obama directly to settle this matter peacefully. The settlement will not alter the status in Crimea but must prevent Ukrainian attempts to block access to Crimea and prevent groups from fomenting chaos in eastern Ukraine by either side. Ukraine can do this but requires international financial assistance to again become a prosperous independent state. It is a little surprising that the masked individuals surrounding the Parliament with axes and demanding the resignation of Ministers receives virtually no media attention here.","I read a lot of psychoanalysis of Putin and the suggestion that he is making policy on the fly. The former is useless. Of course he is making policy decisions as events unfold and swiftly. The net result is that he is winning. When Putin lays down a red line it is a red line. Also, why would any one expect Putin to telegraph his moves? This is a type of warfare he is engaged in and generals do not typically phone the enemy with their plans.","In a perfect world Crimea would have remained part of Ukraine and maintained ties with Russia while expanding contacts with the west and declaring it would not join NATO. The invasion and its consequences (not good for anyone) could have been avoided. Since Mr. Obama is our President and Mr. Putin is President of Russia it's clearly not a perfect world. The situation can become much worse if we scale up the rhetoric and sanctions or Ukraine continues to cut off power or reduces water supplies to Crimea. This may result in invasion of southern and eastern Ukraine by Russia. These two men and their advisers should now resort only to diplomacy and talking to each other and not pander to domestic voices or other pressures. Comparisons to Nazi Germany whose policies led to the death of 50 million worldwide, including millions of Germans and 20 million Soviets is grotesque and unhelpful.","Understanding Putin may just require understanding that he is the President of Russia not the US. It requires understanding that the security and stability of Russia is not benefited by the eastward movement of NATO and the EU (into Poland for example). Putin was probably not thrilled when we promised to install missiles aimed at Russia any more than we were when the Soviet Union installed missiles in Cuba. Bush and Clinton did not reignite the cold war. Obama may be on that road. When the revolution or coup, depending on your viewpoint, occurred in Ukraine a quick-footed President (not our Commander-in-Chief) would have foreseen the impending invasion of Crimea ( I'll bet Gates would have) and sent Kerry to Ukraine to meet with leaders there to work out an arrangement that would meet Ukraine's and Putin's (Russia's) needs and the invasion of Crimea might have been averted. But to send him to meet with Russia's officials and try to convince them of the need to do our bidding rather than Russia's interests was futile and led to our exposure as being impotent and having poor judgment.","It is clear that Putin means to keep his naval base in Sevastopol and to assure a friendly or neutral Crimea at all costs. The President can bluster (and his warning did not constitute that) but the entire world knows we will not intervene. He would correctly ruminate and then correctly toss it to congress. Hopefully those in Kiev will understand all this and negotiate something satisfactory to Ukraine and Russia and end this mess.  The alternative is a military solution (by Russia) and meaningless measures taken by the West and a fait accompli by Putin. I can't help but recall that many voted for the President's re-election thinking he would improve relations with Russia, China, North Korea, settle the Iranian crisis and the  Israeli and Palestinian impasse while rescuing the economy and providing a successful change to delivery of health care, save Detroit......"
Scow2man,,,1,"Oh, heck. Let the Russians have them,.As Churchill said a long time ago, Russia respects only force and despises weakness. That tells us how Putin regards Obama and the United States under his leadership..Obama should at least be honest (?) with us and the world; we will let them take whatever they want.","Let Putin have Ukraine and ponder what he'll want next. Maybe the Baltic states; after all, they were once part of Russia..So were Finland and most of Poland..Let him have them, too..After all, as Obama told Thomas Friedman, if Putin continues, it will be difficult for Obama to have good relations with Russia in his second term.

yasuaki torii,,1,,"Putin too could not grab the changing consensus of the world people. There might be a lot complain and hope in Ukraine and Crimea to this cause of upheaval, but apparently not only from protect Russia's national security from Western action had left Russia feeling cornered.    He is wrong, cornered are not only Russia but US-NATO are too.   After Cold War world order, we endeavored all our powers to concentrate two big parties, US-NATO and Russia.   But the world consensus already have changing subtle but steady.   Rampant nationalism( Arab spring, Orange and this time east Europe, China and peripheral est) are one same type of movement, new trends.   The world people have tired to be forced to globalized, concentrated to pivot (Obama's concept).  They began to decide think themselves, live themselves , live their own life without their upper part of pivots demands and norms.   They now prefer to live according to their history,culture, tradition, religion, consensus instead empty international norms or pivot's orders.    That the fundamental changing world's pendulum swings direction.   Whatever Putin now declare this truce may be shot time compromise.    Because Crimea and Ukraine woke up, they can't anymore tread backward.   The leading powers leaders should know this changing world and manege the each conflict flexible and practical nor according to decades old doctrine of power dominance.","I am absolutely neutral, so may be have the capacity to see the facts more calm and not prejudice.     I see this upheavals villains are Yanukovych and all present temporally new members of Parliament( Turchynov,Klitsko,Yatseyuk, also Tymoshenko est)       They maneuvered and exploited too much from both Russia and West.  WE may be safe to say that truth was both Russia and West were temporally abandoned this selfish, corrupt regime who ever take its's helm.    Added this facts, Olympic and Putin's survival instinct wait and see attitude had driven this independent square movement unexpected directions.   Putin wake up, I don't know actually who did that, but may be domestically situations are almost same as West and Russia even he would be have some power he too can not ignore his people's feelings and demands    Again all Ukraine's old-face must go like Yanukovych did. They are the same culrits as Yanukovych.      They lied. cheated, exploited, betrayed, both of Russia and West.

Why follow us to protect Democracy of Ukraine.     In short the present world politics, we hardly distinct democracy from same kind of autocracy.

He is very  savvy for world consensus.  All politicians are happened to be politician, fundamentally they are common human beings.   Even Putin or Obama can't ignore the domestic people's consensus or trends. Obama's diplomacy is not weak but flexible, it is good for world.  Politicians reputation and income come from domestic not international society. So Putin and Obama must be savvy to know how their people think always.  Decades passed after the World War, Globalization, Centralization have gone,  Localization, Diversity have come. All over the world Nationalism came, Nationalism is one type of localization, diversity.  People tired to be global and begin to want to live own life by own thinking according their culture, tradition, life style.   That Arab spring, Orange revolution, Japan's recent nationalism.      The human history is simple and one who could grab this trends will be great politician.   Obama is good, he is doing America people's and world people's consensus.","Decades passed after the war, the swing of pendulum seemed to be changing.   Universal phenomenon, all people's consensus changing.  Even Putin can't ignore his people's trends.    Ultimately each politicians depend on domestic demands because anyone can't expect his income from international society.   They are all no difference to common people and a kind of businessman.  Their working area happened to be politics.  Globalization has gone, centralization has gone.  Localization, diversification have come.   Simple, nationalism is one type of localization and diversification.  The world people have tired the globalization ans begin to want to live themselves by their own culture, tradition,heritage.     This trend will continue for another decades.    Human history are simple.","Sorry, David,  Your story here is Russian's elite story.  I had lived with a Manchurian farmer in Northern China.

Mixed ethnic, porous border, unclear nationality (actually some time they did not need the nationality because lived in semi-independent autonomous community).

Let's back this article and Putin's philosophy.    I guess that may be there no conception here in Ukraine and Putin (and Northern China), such as international norm, territorial integrity, nation's sovereignty est ideals.  They (and Putin too) are savvy to how accept reality, how to live-survive but they can't understand this West's ideal.       from this view point (Putin and Ukraine differ from West's philosophy),  I think, Putin Can't Stop.

I had lived with a Manchurian farmer in Northern China.   They have been living there centuries mixed with Hun, Mongol, Korean, even Muslim.   Mixed ethnic, porous border, unclear nationality (actually some time they did not need the nationality because lived in semi-independent autonomous community).   Ukraine's crisis have remembered me the Mikhail Sholokhov's  Tikhii  Don....Quiet Don , noble prize winning Russian Revolution Saga.  The hero is a Cossack farmer but nobody know from who he had inherited his Asian feature.  For centuries region have been invaded by Greek, Goth, Mongol, Turk est.  Each invading men left their blood there.  And he had survived The revolution changed his side the white- to red- army.  He went Turkey and gotten his wife there (Crimean say they as Tatars).   Let's back this article and Putin's philosophy.    I guess that may be there no conception here in Ukraine and Putin (and Northern China), such as international norm, territorial integrity, nation's sovereignty est ideals.  They (and Putin too) are savvy to how accept reality, how to live-survive but they can't understand this West's ideal.       from this view point (Putin and Ukraine differ from West's philosophy),  I think, Putin Can't Stop.    West is better think the other methods to this crisis.","No, not President losing in the confrontation to Mr. Putin.   This editorial is absolutely right.  If there were some complain about Obama's dealings, I think, Critics are fundamentally can't catch up the changing world consensus and real democracy.  The world is always changing(without everlasting change, human can't survive, civilization will decay  from inner elements).    After the War, all efforts were concentrated to Globalization, Centralization, only truth is democracy idealism.  But every one who have the ability to antenna to catch changing realty, might have been feeling subtle change.   The pendulum swing, world consensus changing to decentralization, not-globalization, not one truth conception but plural truth thinking est.  The west accuse Putin about international law(norm), territorial integrity, sovereign est, but those are only West's ideal, are not they?  Truth are plural conception, people can live happily without west categorized democracy, nationality or strict boarder.Crimea is not a region west describe;  ethnic...they are not simple one, through centuries they mixed with Greek, Goth, Hun, Mongol, Slav,Turk est.  Where is west's concept nation, border, how to live,way of life.   Accept the real democracy. Have the tolerance that there people who have not the same thought with us.  Let's return Ukraine. Make truth to be able to begin compromise negotiation. Abandon we are right, you are wrong attitude, that will bear nothing."
Claus Gehner,,,,"Conservatives seem to like the macho rhetoric of the Bush administration - the axis of evil - which then led directly to two desasterous, unnecessary and illegal wars. The US has no credibility at all when it now pronouces that Russia is violating international norms with its occupation of Crimea - note that not a single shot has yet been fired and no casualties have been reported...The rhetorical link by conservatives between the supposed weakness of Obama's response in Syria and emboldening Putin to move into Crimea is just too silly for words, and typical of the conservative nonsense. Military intervention in Syria would be a new, even more dangerous bottomless pit without exit strategy than Afghanistan and Iraq were. Even if Syria never happened, Putin would have intervened in UkraineCrimea - Russian stakes there are just too high.","The Editorial Board would do well to take a look at the Readers' Picks to realize out out of step the US media is with what many Americans perception is today, namely that the US no longer, not for quite some time, has the moral high ground from which to criticize other nations, including Russia - they must make it clear to Putin that he has stepped far outside the bounds of civilized behaviour...At least the Russians did not lie to the UNwhole world in order to justify its agression...It is also worth remembering that the Ukraine obtained its current territorial expanse only within the confines of the Soviet Union, and there was no guarantee that this territorial integrity would be maintained post Soviet Union, similar to the breakup of Jougoslavia, which was largely an artifact of the Cold War.","I have no idea what Mr. Friedman is trying to say here .....On the one hand he says that the US's (and the West's) arrogance and ignorance after the fall of the Soviet Union in relentlessly driving NATO eastward was what ultimately initiated the new anti-Western sentiment in Russia...On the other hand he falls into this deplorable American habit of painting Putin as a thoroughly evil leader, intent on a domestic policy of looting Russia (that is complete nonsense!) Putin did not gin up nationalism and anti-Westernism to distract the Russian Public - Mr. Friedman, you just got done arguing that this new anti-Westernism is due to American arrogance and ignorance about Russia's history. Russia, forget about Putin, ANY Russian leader would not stand still in the face of potentially loosing controlaccess to Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet through encroachment of NATO into Ukraine. The US is still maintaining an absolutely idiotic blockade of Cuba because the Soviet Union, a LONG time ago, established a military presence there, which no longer exists...And what is this nonsense about having a serious renewable energy ... strategy ... to undermine Putin. Do you honestly believe that coming up with a renewable energy strategy NOW will seriously impact the acute dependence on Russian oil and gas in the short- or even mid-term?..I fully agree that economic sanctions and immediate financial aid to stabilize Ukraine are absolutely necessary, but the rest of this is nonsense.","The Editorial Board would do well to take a look at the Readers' Picks to realize out out of step the US media is with what many Americans perception is today, namely that the US no longer, not for quite some time, has the moral high ground from which to criticize other nations, including Russia - they must make it clear to Putin that he has stepped far outside the bounds of civilized behaviour...At least the Russians did not lie to the UNwhole world in order to justify its agression...It is also worth remembering that the Ukraine obtained its current territorial expanse only within the confines of the Soviet Union, and there was no guarantee that this territorial integrity would be maintained post Soviet Union, similar to the breakup of Jougoslavia, which was largely an artifact of the Cold War.",,,,,,

Is Russia burning?,"What a timely contrast.  Thank you..The Pope invites change while Putin tries to seize the imagine past. The Pope appears to have been rebuffed but only by bishops, not the people. Putin appears to have the support of the Russian people but only as long as their fear of him and his bullying cause more pain than the consequences of crushing their neighbors.  The bishops who tolerated and hid the pedophile priest scandal imagine that the church faithful has forgotten their sin and hungers for repression and condemnation of gay and divorced and married Catholics.  Putin cannot see how he has wakened the border states to distrust, and the world to sanction his efforts.  The oil threat he holds over Europe dwindles as the price spirals downward as the world moves to drop the price and finally abandon that polluting commodity..Pope Francis will prevail or the church will fail.  Putin has invited isolation and exclusion which only an exporting nation can appreciate.",Putin digs his own grave. 14 of Russians are Sunni Muslims. Russia is surrounded by Sunni Muslims. Time will reveal the sorry mistake he has made. Is Russia burning?,"There are over 2 million Muslims living in Moscow and 14 of the population of Russia are Muslims. What occurred when the Soviet government collapsed Mr. Putin described as a paralysis of power. whereas, it was the failure of the raison d'etre. There lies the primary flaw in all of Putin's actions. Trying to restore an idea is like clinging to a corpse. It stinks, it is dangerous, it will always fail..Republicans who have allied themselves with the Tea Party are using the same strategy. Every success that Putin or Republicans appear to achieve has the visage and stench of death..Clinging to their guns and Bibles, is no different than sending troops to Syria. There is no achievable goal. What happens next if Assad is restored to power? What happens next if science denial, racism, misogyny, and the dismantling of the social safety net prevails?.Putin deserves close attention. The war faction in America must be scrutinized for any correlation to Putin. Are our actions in response to Putin's efforts to restore the Russian Empire or do they provide a humane course and rational progress to the victims of religious fanaticism and colonial exploitation?","The dreadful revealthat Putin can make is the unimportance of foreign, international money and financing as long as the Russian people will tolerate a level of privation for a period of time greater than the western economies and their peoples can tolerate inconvenience and privation.  The upper echelons of wealth are, in this scenario, most vulnerable as they have no tolerance for privation or sacrifice.  These groups have power and the resources to manipulate the media and corrupt government, that is government that has been bought and paid for.  It is likely that these groups will, like the Russian oligarchs attempt to muster self serving policies and politicians to do their bidding.  Putin has already disciplined his oligarchs.  The west has debased itself to their oligarchs notably in the financial collapse and subsequent recovery which ostensibly rendered sovereign states impotent vis-a vie the IMF, Banks, and Corporations and now all of these states bend to their oligarchs.  Political power and political will always trump economic power..Their shortsighted greed and strategies to shrink the western middle class and punish the majority of laborers, western oligarchs will flounder with thinly veiled attempts to rally their victims to support the preservation of their personal fortunes. Putin understands that wealth and arms are only tools of political power.  The west will try to dissuade him with wealth and arms. A Putin engineered recession may trump the effort.","In the global village our illusions about Russia are far less dangerous than our self delusion.  Yes, our inequality, our violations of basic human rights in war, fighting terrorists, and dealing with immigrants, our unalloyed racism that extends to the White House where a Black man could be elected but could not govern, our desperate efforts to rescue our economy from collapse but instead bankrupt the victims and reward the culprits.  Is there any wonder that those American oligarchs who have purchased the Congress, extended their own grip on all economic life, festooned efforts to provide food and basic healthcare, is there any wonder that they can't understand how Putin will sacrifice his oligarchs and rally national political power.  Stupidly, our oligarchs, having corrupted our electoral process, our judiciary and the sovereign states of our hegemony and our allies, our oligarchs failed to see how Putin disciplined Russian oligarchs.  Our oligarchs imagine that they can bend Putin.  If the political support among Russians is accurate, money and arms will not have the anticipated results. Sovereign states, that are actually puppets to oligarchs, will not be able to tolerate the privations that a leader can ask of a population that shares sacrifice..The illusion that afflicts us is that money has value that extends beyond our political process.  It does not, unless you are an oligarch.","Red line skipping is a Republican narrative device with no evidence in reality. Obama is working variables that are not confined to this tempest in the Ukraine. Supplying weapons or talking about supplying weapons has effect in Berlin as much as it has in Moscow.

He is betting that Assad can rule Syria despite Assad's territorial isolation within Syria, he is betting that Russia will somehow improve it's standing among the European nations that are already embargoing Russia, he is betting that when Russian planes collide with British, French, Canadian, Saudi, Omani, or Israeli planes that Russia will gain credibility?

Jesse Marioneaux,1,,,Obama is getting exposed as the fraud and imposter he is Putin is running circles around him and America.,Putin has outsmarted Obama by many years.  Putin has watched America for decades and is seeing the corruption happen and no one to stop it. Putin will come in as a saint and it shameful that the great America is being destroyed morally like this.,Putin has outclassed and outplayed Obama on the world stage this is what happens when you get leaders with no experience in world events. Putin is KGB which is the equivalent to the American CIA so he knows how to play the cards very well. We need a leader like that in America.,,,,,,,

The Russian people, hoodwinked by propaganda and nationalistic pride, believe all sorts of misinformation. Putin is sitting pretty, so all these letters talking about decency mean nada.  Hes pulling the strings and likes it, thank you very much. Same with those Russians fighting in Ukraine. Theyre nothing but thugs. Killers.

Or it was the U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. I don't know whether Putin has this right about Syria or Obama does. We should have learned by now that actions we think are correct can and do often lead to unintended and unwelcome consequences. Just as we didn't consult Russia before taking our actions in Syria with regard to ISIS, Putin is now doing the same by not consulting with us. I wonder when the two greatest powers in the world will align around the common goal of eliminating the barbarism and human toll taking place there.","While conservative by nature and quick to support the U.S. as it relates to foreign affairs I am having a difficult time not understanding the Russian position on Crimea. If I have the history right Crimea was part of Russia for upwards of 200 years. In the 1950's the USSR gave Crimea to their republic of Ukraine. No public vote or anything like that. Simply given to the Ukraine by Khrushchev. ..Some 40 years later as the USSR is unraveling, the Ukrainian people vote to be an independent country and no longer part of the Soviet Union. Crimeans vote as well and by a very small majority vote along the same lines. ..Fast forward to 2014. Political corruption in Ukraine including their President who gets driven out of office. Crimeans ask for and then vote to go back to the good old days and become part of Russia again and not part of Ukraine. ..Setting aside the concern for Putin and Russia making unilateral moves into other countries, which they haven't done, is the U.S. reaction firmly right and Putin's firmly wrong?

I'd go further however. We seem incapable of quiet and private diplomacy. And at some point we will have to find a diplomatic way out of these meager punitive measures because it will be in the best interests of the EU and ourselves.

Maybe he is mystified, as am I, that we fail to see his point of view as it relates to Crimea, and have started sanctions knowing he isn't leaving Crimea. Maybe his objective is to try to get the wheels back on the track that we've worked hard at knocking off the track. Suddenly Obama is a water walker because Putin picked up the phone? I've been asking for a week why Obama didn't pick up the phone. He's been too busy with his diplomacy in the press.","It seems clear to me that Putin hasn't been particularly truthful about a number of things during this crisis. Arguing the Russian troops in Crimea aren't Russian is the most obvious example. ..But given the history of the Ukraine I am having a hard time not understanding why he feels his actions so far are justified, nor the possibility he decides to redraw the map after the voter referendum in Crimea is concluded...I also think our diplomacy during this crisis has been amateurish at best. Public threats will commit us to take actions and report on them to the world. Public threats box us into following through even if they don't achieve a change in the outcome in the Ukraine. And if we end up doing nothing we will once again have blustered and ultimately look like we never had a clue. ..We continue to have a propensity under this administration to want to publicly and quickly declare our stance on world issues only to fumble around and reverse course as events unfold.

The country depends basically on oilgas exports to generate foreign currency. Russia is another oilgas exporting country along with Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran. ..That type of integration, in turn, generates a major strategic economic-financial weakness.

Europe takes care of bailing out Ukraine's economy while paying costs associated with trade and business deal losses incurred with Russia. ..At this juncture, Mrs. Merkel and associates do seem enthusiastic about Washington diplomatic approach to solve  the conflict.

Arun,,,,"Stephen F. Cohen wrote in The Nation (Feb 11):   The now exceedingly dangerous confrontation between the two Ukraines was not ignited, as the Times claims, by Yanukovychs duplicitous negotiatingor by Putinbut by the EUs reckless ultimatum, in November, that the democratically elected president of a profoundly divided country choose between Europe and Russia. Putins proposal for a tripartite arrangement, rarely if ever reported, was flatly rejected by US and EU officials...Friedman writes It would have been nice if we could have forged a compromise with President Vladimir Putin of Russia that would have allowed Ukraine to gradually join the European Union and not threaten him. President Obama tried to find such a win-win formula. But Putin is not into win-win here. He is into win-lose. So he must lose, for the sake of Ukraine and Russia...Flatly contradicting each other. Who am I to believe?  I believe Stephen F. Cohen. Friedman undermined himself with his cheerleading for the war in Iraq. I reject Friedman.","From an outsider's view, Mr. Putin seems to come across as one who prefers to hide behind Mother Russia's skirts by day, preferring instead to be a thief by night, using sneaky and underhanded means to take Crimea and indulge in other subterfuge, most significantly as a secret instigator and primer of the current conflict...Who knows if the majority of people in that territory wish to align with Russia or not? If they do or did, then there was, and remains a fair and internationally verifiable process to determine this. Unfortunately the collective gut impulse in that part of the world appears to want to accomplish goals only through underhand methods.  Probably because there is little historical basis or faith that fairness is even possible there...It's possible to surmise that although the local villagers in Eastern Ukraine may legitimately be shocked to see the consequences of murky conflict so starkly in the form of strewn dead and innocent passengers, they are likely ill-equipped (as in many other rural parts of the world) to know how to behave or respond (i.e. cordon the crash site, respect the dead, preserve belongings and evidence etc.) - certainly by western standards and norms. People can only do their best and there are reports of at least some locals trying to place flowers and makeshift memorials at the site.  ..The real onus of civilized behavior lies on the leaders of this conflict or their proxies. Unfortunately everyone seems to be at their mercy.","Yes, trk, we don't want to live in Putin's world. We played poker with him, with Ukraine as the stakes and lost. Now some of the NYT commentariat wants us to pull out our guns...Nov 21, 2013:..Russia is willing to take part in tripartite negotiations with Ukraine and the EU, but only if they are held before Ukraine signs an association agreement with the EU, Russian President Vladimir Putin said...November 29, 2013:..The EU-Ukraine association agreement cannot be elaborated in the EU-Ukraine-Russia tripartite format, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said at a press conference after the Eastern Partnership Vilnius summit. He rejected as unacceptable the tripartite negotiations ....--.(posting the links to the news items causes my post to be rejected by the NYT).Some columns ago, Thomas Friedman at the NYT tried to convince us: It would have been nice if we could have forged a compromise with President Vladimir Putin of Russia that would have allowed Ukraine to gradually join the European Union and not threaten him. President Obama tried to find such a win-win formula. But Putin is not into win-win here. He is into win-lose. So he must lose, for the sake of Ukraine and Russia...Why was the offer of tripartite talks rejected outright?","And trk, if the President did make the case that our national interests require a military alliance that extends to the border of Ukraine, I would ask him, why at this moment of time in 2014, is it such a necessity?..Without world solidarity, most importantly including Russia (and China), we cannot come to negotiated end to Iran's nuclear ambitions; nor can we come to a negotiated end to the Syrian civil war.   Is growing military relations with Ukraine (instead of undertaking the negotiations Putin proposed in November 2013) so much more important than say, Iran?  Haven't we have greatly increased the likelihood of war with this feckless foreign policy?  ..What is the great foreign-policy-gleaned-from-taxi-drivers-expert Thomas Friedman's take on all of this?  Why would a heavily-sanctioned Russia cooperate with the sanctions on Iran?  Must Putin lose so that we can have the war Friedman much desires with Iran?",,,,,,

The results of Obama's weakness was the loss of Crimea, &amp; the eventual loss of Eastern Ukraine, which will lead to Russia taking over all of the Ukraine.

He is into win-lose. ..If you do a search, there seems to be lots of articles where Putin is pleading for trilateral talks between EU, Ukraine and Russia, but the EU is seen rejecting this outright and insisting it will only talk with Ukraine. Looks to me like Putin was the one trying for a win-win and the EU is only into win-lose.... Friedman should really do a little more research before publishing these pieces. This is just lazy journalism. Not what I expect from a NY times op ed writer.","I respect Mr. McCain more than any other of the War Hawks as he has actually served this country and his viewpoint should be respected as he been there personally.  Putin is a bully and that is a fact, however, why should we get involved.  Half of Crimea wants to join Russia..We look weak because we can't even get anything at home working and it is apparent to the world..My question to these War Hawks is why should we use tax dollars on another conflict and not use it on public projects that will help the average American?",,,,
MB,,,,If I was Assad I'd be worried.  The hammer will come down on someone Putin can't protect.,"Let's see . . . how about canceling all Aeroflot flights to Europe, the US, Japan, etc. etc. and so forth, and stopping all flights by any airlines to Russia. Freezing any and all Russian bank accounts in the West. Canceling shipment of anything, if anyone, except for France and their weapons, is still shipping to Russia. Canceling France's weapon shipments. Stop buying anything made by Russia. Insisting that US tech companies who have branches and contracts in Russia stop work and stop payment. Is that drastic enough? I'm guessing canceling the airline flights might do the trick pretty fast...And before someone screams that innocent people will be harmed, including all the businesses who continue to deal with Russia as people die, take a good look at Ukraine and the thousands of innocent people who are being harmed there, not to mention the passengers on the Malaysian flight. Russia has in effect declared war. Talking and the limited sanctions have had no effect so far. Time for some action that might get Putin's attention.",For Putin it is a payback for Serbia in reverse. NATO bombed Miloshevich's Serbia to stop flood of Albanians refugees from Kosovo. Putin bombs Assad's enemies allegedly to establish peace and stop migration. The difference is that Assad is the reason that millions of Syrians has left and still leaving Syria. Helping him will not help refugees.,,,,,,,

A negative energy field has been erected around this President that while it may seem inconsequential does embolden one who can imagine invincibility by not allowing full expression of the masses.

One Planet,,,,"Merkel, Hollande and Obama hold Ukraine down while Russia rapes and assaults her, and all signs point to the fact that this will not stop until she is murdered.  And the Western press is on and on about the defeat of Debaltseve, while nattering on about a cease-fire and how Poroshenko failed! THERE WAS AND IS NO CEASE-FIRE, PEOPLE, and the Western leaders knew that there wouldn't be one. The real story here is that Russia did not hold to the cease-fire, has started a war and will not stop, has caused the deaths of thousands of innocents (including the victims of MH17) and even gets to parade in front of the United Nations to legitimize its predatory position. Western 'leaders' silently agree with Putin's blithe and sickening dismissal of all of Russia's crimes: Life is life; it just goes on, Mr. Putin said. No need to dwell on it.","You say that Putin is not blocking access to the site. Perhaps not directly, but I'd bet that somehow Russian experts will be there on the ground, if they're not there already, and the black boxes will end up in the Kremlin's hands, allowing the Russians to spin their own narrative on what happened. And, guess what, neither Russia nor the rebels will be the guilty parties. Just you wait.","Having read countless news stories and prognostications and proposed solutions of this ongoing (and seemingly never-ending), crisis, a phrase repeats constantly  throughout: ..a claim denied by Russia.)plus variations on the theme: a claim denied by Putinthe KremlinMoscowLavrov...)..Every action of Russia's is met with denials and lies afterwards. I am glad to see that people are no longer fooled that this 'peace plan' proposal is no more and no less than another of Putin's tiresome games, designed to soften the stance of  Europe and the U.S. ahead of their meeting. I am glad that it isn't working this time...It is beyond reckoning that the one fomenting the conflict (a claim denied by Russia) is the one proposing peace. A 'peace' that will allow Russia maximum leverage and face-saving.","One would have thought that Western leaders and the Kievans would have learned that what Russia says, it implements...It would be a relief to everyone if Russia, for once, meant what it said and came clean about its actions and intentions...As well, Putin said he could take Kyiv in two weeks. Kremlin propaganda trolls have started threatening nuclear holocaust. Based on what you said, the next step is for Russia to begin implementation. Have I interpreted your words correctly?","In 1994, the U.S.  (along with the U.K. and Russia) signed the Budapest Memorandum, promising to respect Ukraine's boundaries in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arms. It both amuses and amazes me how many of the Americans who say 'let's stay out of this, this isn't our conflict' seem to have forgotten this. The U.S. has an obligation here, as does the U.K. Not to honour it makes these nations no better than Russia...I wish the media would just call it like it is: the 'pro-Russian insurgents' show is being run by Russians. One Russian general has admitted as much. I know that recent polls have shown that these eastern and southern areas do want to stay with Ukraine. But, perhaps they people are afraid, given that there are masked, camouflage-wearing, machine-gun toting, scary looking men hanging around and taking over their buildings. We have seen what has happened to Ukrainians  who have publicly stated their support for Ukraine: beatings and at least one murder, not to mention the OSCE kidnappings. I suspect many of the contributors to this message board might also be laying low should they find themselves in the same circumstances. It is very likely that the police who provide no opposition in these areas have been bought off, as have many of the pro-Russian protestors. ..The desires of these eastsouth Ukrainians would easily be known during elections. But the goal of Putin right now is not to have them on May 25: democracy is anathema to him and his ilk.","In fact the Ukraine is also Russian...Not seeing how this is possible, so I will ask a rhetorical question: So does this mean the United States is also Spanish?..Russian soldiers are in Ukraine, and Putin has been arming the rebelsmercenaries.","Why do I keep thinking that the essential story is being missed. We hear calls for Putin to intervene with the rebels so that a proper investigation can be carried out. ..Putin IS intervening - someone is running the show there, and it isn't the Ukrainian government or any other international body (and not the Donetsk People's Republic). Someone has ordered refrigerated trains, someone has organized the collection of bodies, someone has had the black body bags brought in, someone has the black boxes (and knew how to find them), and someone has ordered that plane parts be moved. So, who is it? ..Once the evidence disappears, then the international experts will be allowed in to crawl all over the site and find what they can...Putin says one thing, just enough to call the dogs off, and then he does another. While he makes public statements saying that there should be a cease fire to allow for an international investigation, rest assured that that's just playing for time...in plain daylight and before the entire world.",,,
MT,,,,"Anyone with a basic knowledge of Ukrainian political and economical structure (both binomial and unstable) could predict the outcome of the coup. The coup was inspired and supported by the USA (mainly).  Now guess who is responsible for the unpleasant (for Europe and Russia, not for the US) outcome of the coup? Surely Russia is. Lets punish those bad Russians. Ordinary Russians should feel that if they do not support the US made coups, they will suffer. Glory to the USA!..In the next series:.-If Eastern Ukraine will have referendum  Putin is a liar, lets impose sanctions.-If Eastern Ukraine will postpone referendum  It proves that Putin controls separatists, lets impose sanctions.-If Russia will move forward to prevent civil war  Russia is a bully, lets impose sanctions.- If Russia will move backward  Russians blinked! (bluffing, weak,), sanctions are effective, lets impose more!.- Bad Russians do not want to give their natural gas to Ukraine for free  they pressure emerging democracy! Lets impose sanctions!.etc...The USA reminds me later days of USSR. Huge debt, overstretched budget, support of socialism (democracy) across the globe. Oh my dear Americans.....Strangely, ordinary Russians were never eager to impose sanctions on any nation. That is suspicious, dont you think? Maybe sanctions will help?","That is exactly what Kiev wants and that is why they refuse negotiations and send paramilitary forces to the East to kill some of those nasty, grumpy citizens (why not, really!).  Junta knows it will not be able to control all Ukraine and chooses to escalate conflict in order to provoke Russia to invade. I do not think that Putin cannot see the trap. Thus, 22bl will probably be paid to Russia by US and EU. Luckily US can print as much money as needed.",The ukrainians have to fix their country themself..- Agree 100...But it would be a big help if Putin wouldn't pour always some gasoline on the nationalistic separation..- What? Just Wiki out some info about Svoboda party and Right Sector. Nothing familiar? Nationalistic separation is NO1 idea from pro-European (HaHa!) fanatics. Citizens from the Eastern Ukraine regarded by them as lumpenproletariat at best.,"The article could have been reduced to Mr. Putin has not yet made any public statements about the latest events. (which drives us crazy!:))..Concerning gas contracts.Russia has never used natural gas contracts with Ukraine as a lever when relations soured. Rather, every attempt of Russia to get some money for its product (current Ukranian debt to Gazprom is about 1bn) and stop its stealing, is interpreted as such by some clich-addict media.",,,,,,
Norman Pollack,,,,"Mr. Putin's moves--effectively upending the agreements that served as the foundation of a post-Cold War order in Europe....  Nope.  That post-Cold War order was upended first by US-EU-NATO when with the unification of Germany the promise was made that NATO would not be expanded eastward.  We see the result, as in absorbing Poland and the Czech Republic into NATO, breaking that pledge.  But more, US-contrived pressure on the internal politics of Ukraine to join EU, for the express and related purpose of taking on NATO membership, meant only one thing: NATO presence right at the Russian border...Putin acted a) timely, with the coup d'etat against the democratically-elected president of Ukraine, and b) wisely, given the provocative NATO posture which no doubt would mean missiles, bases, etc.  Yet the US persists with its containmentisolation policy, long in the works (the Cold War never ended!), directed to Russia, using subliminal anticommunism as a motivating factor even well after communism ceased to describe Russia, and, that for precedent, turning the same policy onto China, also post-communist...One can say, Obama's war-proclivity toward Russia and China is merely the way of asserting US global hegemony AND clamping down dissent at home.  For what is massive surveillance but the recrudescence of Nazi-like policy, wholly unjustified by the rule of law?  Obama's gleeful resort to targeted assassination speaks for his moral emptiness and contempt for civil liberties.","I expect better of MacFarquhar and The Times--everything here to disparage Putin.  Why the one-sideness, except that NYT has become an uncritical mouthpiece of the administration, abandoning objective journalism.  There was no point for the remark, there was some chance that it was all a feint, unless to smear Putin, and the sentence, By pulling back from the threat, Mr. Putin seemed to be trying to reassert some measure of control, means that he is damned if he does, damned if he doesn't, so that the pullback per se is first denied, and then given negative meaning.  This kind of distortion disgraces the memory of A.O. Sulzberger...Putin even urges dialogue and postponing the referendum; meanwhile all Obama can do, like a spoiled brat or bully, is stir the pot in order to a) bring NATO to Russia's border, and b) incite tensions in the hope of dramatic confrontation.  No softie there.  With Brennan, Clapper, and Rice by his side, America, in the name of liberal humanitarianism, is spoiling for a fight.  And after Russia, comes China.  Obama's Pacific Rim tour is at one with his get-tough policy toward Russia--do to both Russia and China the same thing: encirclement, containment, isolation...No doubt The Times editorial board would applaud, no longer indecisive, now the determined leader of the Free World, a fusion therefore of counterterrorism, anticommunism (we're still fixed on the Cold War, no matter the changes in Russia and China, and counterrevolution.","Hi Jodi, Good, I respect spirited disagreement.  I ask in return: Does Putin have a hit list and Terror Tuesdays sit around personally authorizing Assassinations?  Has Putin mounted two unjustified interventions, Iraq and Afghanistan, in sync with GWB?  Has Putin reached the same degree of contempt for civil liberties via massive surveillance, eavesdropping on foreign leaders, and using the Espionage Act to silence whistleblowers?  Has Putin engineered the coup that toppled the Ukrainian democratically-elected president, or for that matter sponsored paramilitary operations of CIA-JSOC for regime change?  Has Putin developed the pivot, the Pacific-first strategy, for isolating China--or kept a global network of military bases, or sought a military alliance (NATO) right up to the border of America?..In the spirit of frank discussion I ask you and NYT posters who enthusiastically condemn Putin to answer my questions.  I suggest Putin in this developing crisis is acting more responsibly than Obama, that Lavrov is more committed to peace than Kerry, that Obama's national-security team is far more determined on a course of war (eventually, nuclear) than Putin's team.  America has been an aggressor for so long that we take that for granted.  One does not have to be a stooge of the Kremlin (of which you accuse me) to recognize the dire consequences of US policy.  Red-baiting seems old-fashioned; we've been through that with McCarthyism.  I'm glad to see it back in style.","Obama has dropped all pretense of constructive leadership and shows himself to be obsessed with confrontation and force.  To be to the Right of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce, esp. for a Democrat, requires some doing.  But Obama is now a true ideologue, more warlike, more capitalist, more jingoist, than many traditional conservative groups...Also more foolhardy, for he is now distancing himself from the EU--and worse, marching toward the edges of what seems his intent: to provoke submission from Russia, and then China (given his Pacific-first strategy), all at the risk of nuclear war...Bad enough we as a nation have to endure massive surveillance of our own people, bad enough to have Kerry smother Sisi with love as journalists go to prison, bad enough that he is back to drone assassination and the use of the Espionage Act to prevent revelations of USG wrongdoing.  But to overt face-off against Putin when Putin has not given cause, is ugly, bizarre, madness, as though he wills intervention and war as politically expedient and somehow economically rejuvenating...Radicals are passive and give Obama a free pass.  Ironically, we must look to the business community to curb his appetite for war.  Obama's national security advisers to a person represent what we tend to call the Neo-Cons, passionate in their quest for US UNILATERAL world dominance.  The world, however, is changing, multipolar, tired of living under Cold War assumptions.  Soon, America in splendid isolation.","Gordon's warmed over account shouldn't warrant comment--even the hillary anecdote and photographs appeared before, with little substantive information on the deliberations and agreement reached.  The Times is on a joy ride of escalation, as when an earlier article quoting Dmytro Tymchuk as an impartial observer failed to reveal fascistic leanings.  Why demonize Putin?  Why ignore the significance of the original coup or the proto-Nazi leanings of the the Kiev government?  Why distort Putin's statements about a Russian invasion, when right along he has called for an internal Ukrainian solution?..Is this The Times of A.O.S. and Scotty, or a reincarnation of the Hearst press in 1898, where Ukraine becomes the functional equivalent of the sinking of the battleship Maine as opportunity for going to war?  The drum beat grows louder with each day, Kramer and Herszenhorn leading the charge...Time to vet the incendiary language as unworthy of a great newspaper.  We know of US assistance in the overthrow of a democratically elected government, thus initiating this unfortunate chain of events.  Yet The Times turns a blind eye to the illegality, the fascistic elements at play, the Bandera legacy, the blatant anti-Semitism--why be apologist for all of that, and for an Obama administration up to its neck in global maneuvering to contain China and Russia, indeed, the confrontational stance with its militaristic patina?..I'm deeply ashamed of what is happening to the newspaper of record.","NYT's open-ended bias against Putin and Russia continues to expand.  Still no mention of the coup, which brought events to a head, or the EU-Kiev proposal of placing NATO troops on the Russian border.  Why are not these factors taken into account.  Moreover, separatists is a loaded term (as is minions), for federalization was the initial goal, until the bloody massacre at Trades Union House in Odessa--also not mentioned, nor the significant neo-Nazi component of the kiev government...Strangely, you assume Putin's aggressiveness when it was he who opened discussions with O.S.C.E., while EU and Kiev were running away.  And it was he who kept pleading for DIALOGUE between the parties.  You make the mistake of equating him sotto voce with Hitler, a campaign of vilification which, by hardening the West and Kiev, make confrontation and perhaps full-scale war possible.  Even probable...Yes events are running out of hand.  I believe the US wants war with Russia, or believes it can have its geopolitical way through the superiority of its nuclear weapons and military force.  So much for our Nobelist in the WH, in pursuit not only of isolating Russia but unifiying the framework so as to do the same to China.  America uber alles!","US accustomation to its own double-standard, founded on its claims of global hegemony, will of course distort the Crimea referendum and fuel age-old Cold War thinking, as in how in 1949 we lost China because of softness at home--and now, will lose Crimea to the Russian Bear (aka still Soviet Russia in disguise, with Putin merely a stand-in for Stalin), therefore overlooking and exonerating American intervention on the side of the Kiev government--born of coup d'etat.  Even to suggest America lacks toughness under Obama (current US criticism of the situation) reveals both how far to the Right we've come (a John McCain-Lindsey Graham configuration of war for its own sake to prove greatness!) and the underestimation that Obama is fully in there as warmonger-interventionist, and utter negation of Nobel Peace Prize...Crimea is fully justified in its vote, a) because of the coup and deposing of a democratically-elected president, and b) the fascistic character of the Kiev government, which we are loathe to admit.  Ukraine violated international law and its own Constitution--not Russia.  Yet the US, despite its own role in Ukraine regime change, appears anxious to escalate tensions with Russia, for the puerile reason of showing to the world its toughness and credibility...The fascism we tolerate--perhaps even praise--in those we put into office (so that NATO can move up to Russia's borders)--is rubbing off at home, for Obama, fascism lite, for his critics, the genuine article.","The implication of Bremmer's analysis is: If the US draws redlines, back them up, lest America lose international credibility.  Nay, not the implication, for he already suggests that, but rather, view the Russian perspective as that which is different from our own--and act accordingly.  Bremmer doesn't object to confrontation, even war, just, no matter what, convey the image of weakness.  To US military policy makers, govt. or academic, the operative word is CREDIBILITY, even if that should should bring down the world around i60 years ago Herman Kahn could not have said it better: Hegemony is America's divine right.  Beef up forces before issuing threats, then pounce when ready.  Ukraine today is everything and nothing, a chance for moving military forces to the Russian border, at th same time a mere convenience, a pawn in the Power Game...Why US comparative weakness in Europe?  Because Obama is already with Pacific-first moving beyond, to the real ENEMY China, so that military assets are steaming--in the case of naval power--that away, superbombers are being put in place, the Far East America's much sought New Hegemonic Glory!  Even Putin and Russia, demonized, to be sure, are becoming Old Hat, particularly since deep-down the US really is taking Putin for granted as one who is moderate, circumspect, in the use of power.  Our script for him is ourselves looking in the mirror. China's another story, a country challenging our claims of global unilateralism and dominance.","Excellent article.  This is not about Khodorkovsky nor about the Sochi Olympics, but about the world power configuration and whether the US and Russia (and we must include China) can live together in peace...As an American, I side here with Putin, strange--and unpatriotic--as that may sound, as a way of seeking greater American democracy.  Obama preaches freedom and presides via drone warfare over targeted assassination, in fact and inevitably the murder of little children.  He uses gay rights as a cover in geopolitics to pursue global hegemony.  He waves a liberal banner at the same time that America now has the widest  differences in the distribution of income, wealth, and power in its history...Yet Obama has the gall to personally boycott the Winter Olympics, and cast Russia as the repressive monster.  On foreign policy today--the decisive world issue because of the dangers involved--Russia has not been aggressive.  The US constantly fishes in troubled waters, Obama's pivot, his Pacific-first strategy, his nuclear modernization and arms build-up, his phony humanitarian interventionism, all represent threats to world peace...Russia, repressive? Obama's National Security State, with NSA, the New Gestapo, makes Putin look tepid in comparison.  Currently the US is conducting the largest surveillance ' eavesdropping program in human history.  Yet we wave the fig leaf of gay rights to show how humane we are.  I'm glad for Khodorkovsky's release..  How about Snowden, here?","Putin called Obama, not the reverse.  Rather than insinuate the coup is a propaganda ploy of Russia, honesty requires looking at the role of Sveboda and Right Sector in Ukraine's government, and the latter's threatening of the Parliament.  Honesty also requires acknowledging America's role in the coup as well as its long-term purpose: to make Ukraine the entry way for US-EU-NATO-IMF influence and, a specifically NATO military presence on the Russian border.  By neglecting these points, NYT forfeits its claim to objectivity and becomes an Obama mouthpiece.  For shame...Putin sought to defuse a growing conflict.  Instead, the NYT-US line is that sanctions hurt, and the Putin is blinking.  Obama's variant on the theme, stated earlier in the week is that Russia demonstrated its weakness by its actions in Crimea.  A groundswell of Reaction, centered on the constant repetition of the terms 'toughness and 'credibility, reveals the macho-bully motif in America which could easily lead to war.  NYT, why cater to this pathological mindset?  Don't you find deplorable the Nazifascistanti-Semitic forces driving forward the coup and running the interim government?  Is our country's hatred of Russia so great that we would welcome any alternative, just as these groups' earlier formation joined Hitler to oppose Russia in World War II?..Fascism is alive and well, and reaching out to it, as here, implies the willingness to join its ranks.  Rather, American must question its hegemonic quest."
MS,,,,It isn't Putin who has understood nothing. It is Merkel and Co.,"Putin already annexed Crimea, as it was full of Russians.  It was full of Russians because Stalin relocated the native Crimean Tatars years ago.

I'm currently across the border on vacation with my family in the Rostov region of Russia and watching the intensification of the Ukrainian conflict over the last month has been agonizing. My Russian born wife is firmly against the separatists and support by Russia but regular Russians like those we stay with are fed a steady diet of propaganda on state TV that renders alternative views impossible. I hope Russian people will have the courage of Ukraine in the long term and seek to change their system. Most importantly Putin has got to go. The fact that he gets to claim credit as a peacemaker disgusts me. He's a crafty one though. He's practically pulled off another Georgia  Moldova frozen conflict.

NeverLift,,,,"Obama averted war for peace in our time, and laid a blueprint for a Mid East nuclear war in the not too distant future.  He surrendered to Iran and, by proxy, Assad and Putin...Just what could he ask of Putin that would get any answer but a resounding -- and public -- nyet!!?","Putin has nothing but contempt for Obama -- contempt for his weakness on the international stage.  To Putin, Kerry's acceptance of terms dictated by Iraq, as ordered by Obama, is just further evidence of Obama's readiness to fold under pressure, his desperation to leave some kind of legacy of achievement when his legacy will anything but...Obama will continue to avoid talks with Putin for one reason.  He is afraid of him.  He knows what Putin thinks of him -- and, as a result, of the US as an opponent of Putin's quest for empire -- and does not know how to come out of such a meeting with his tattered international image not further diminished...When Putin thinks of Obama -- he smirks.  Obama knows that.  He knows that -- unless he is willing to rattle the saber and mean it -- Putin would use a meeting to further humiliate him...There will be no meeting.  At most, a perfunctory grouping for the cameras, and the photo will show Obama beaming.  And Putin smirking.","The Soviet attempt to maintain military pace with the West virtually bankrupt their economy and brought about the collapse of that regime...One can only hope that Putin's arrogance has not totally erased his memory of that debacle.  Unfortunately, what is most memorable to him is almost certainly his personal feeling of humiliation at that defeat and from that, combined with his need to be viewed as the savior of Russia from degeneration into criminal oligarch chaos, his reaction is likely to be irrational...The EU is working towards weaning their energy needs from Russian oil, Putin's principal source of revenue.  That and the continued tightening of sanctions may push him to the point of choosing between a course of action he would view as surrender and widening his military adventures.  Surrender is not in his vocabulary...The absence of firm, meaningful, support for Ukraine's fight to stay independent may well have led him to believe that he can advance with impunity.  I hope that NATO has maintained the same capacity  and willingness  to counter Russian advances that existed in the days of the USSR, and that all NATO heads of state  particularly Obama, who has vacillated repeated throughout his second term on this subject  make it publicly clear that they are committed to such a course.","Putin does not knuckle under.  To anybody...This is part of a strategy.  Likely scenario:  The pro-separatists will try to hold their referendum.  Kiev will attempt to stop it.  Pro-separatists will die in massive fighting.  They will beg that their native land, Russia, save them.  Putin will respond militarily, saying, It is the duty of the Motherland to protect its children...He is incorrigible.  He is devoted.  He is devious.  He has nukes.  He fears no western power...He is KGB.  Never forget that.","Putin keeps referring to Russians living in the Ukraine.  If the people he cites hold Russian passports, then not only is he correct, but they can be sent home by the Ukraine as foreigners who have overstayed their visas and, additionally, for trying to overturn the government of their host country  a criminal act in every country on Earth...If, however, they are  as I expect  Ukrainian citizens who happen to speak Russian, then Putin has no more justification than would, say, Mexico threatening to invade the US to protect the rights of those US citizens and legal residents in the southwest who happen to speak Spanish...The language one speaks has no political or legal bearing upon ones rights and responsibilities as a citizen.  Here, it is pure pretense, with Putin reinforcing the illegal violent uprisings with both Russian military in unmarked uniforms (illegal, under the Geneva Conventions) and military grade weapons  including anti-aircraft missiles...Those actions are acts of war.","This is the direct result of two leaders' inherent characters:..Putin, furious at the Soviet Union collapsing under Reagan's SDI proposal -- which they couldn't match, technically or, most importantly, economically -- has stated, and demonstrated, a willingness, even an eagerness, to go to the nuclear brink to get back what he believes the West took from his Russian Empire.  Given the ultimate choice, he might well go nuclear rather than capitulate...But he doesn't have to.  He, and the rest of the world, now understand:  Surrender is Americas new foreign policy...On the other side, we have Mr. Obama.  Weak in international leadership, indecisive in action, inconsistent -- even incoherent -- in proclaiming policy, a demonstrated unwillingness to confront even the Iranian menace, never mind the Russian bear:  This lackluster president has functionally invited Putin's actions. ..What we need in the White House is another Ronald Reagan.  What we have is a Jimmy Carter...I pray Putin will not achieve his goals before the next administration.  By that time, the American public will be fed up with whimpering negotiation and demand assertive opposition to the new Red menace -- before the latter recreates its position as a world power to be feared.","No, that is not that.  The so-called ethic Russians in the disputed oblasts are very much a minority.  The reason you don't hear from the majority there  all ethnic Ukrainians  is that they are unarmed and have been physically suppressed, even killed, by the Russian-armed minority when they dared speak up for their country.  They were prevented from showing their support for Kiev in the sham referendum that the Russians and their in-country lackeys ran.  Nobody  not even Putin  cites that now as expressing the true will of the people of those regions.","I agree with most of what you post.  However:..1.  There is no veto in the General Assembly.  Unfortunately, only the Security Council can authorize action against a member state...2.  Putin does not have veto power in NATO decisions.  It does, unfortunately, have Merkel . . .  Iron Lady Thatcher would never have shown such spineless behavior...3.  The world is far from powerless.  In the extreme:  The US still has 450 Minuteman II missiles in active readiness, in addition to its submarine-borne and airborne nukes.  Many if not most Russian missiles have been lacking in maintenance for so long they are inoperable.  But, if the West would unite, it can cripple the Russian economy with dispatch.  The oligarchs would never stand for that.","We all know that the ethnic Russians in the disputed area are a minority there, and their expectation of autonomy for five oblasts (provinces) of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhi  actually, to later become a Russian province, although it would still contain an ethnic Ukrainian majority  is a fiction created on their behalf by Putin.  Their existence in no way justifies Ukraine surrendering that area to control by a neighboring foreign power...Consider, for example, Texas, with a large and growing Latino  mostly ethnic Mexican  population. (Indeed, it is projected they will be a majority in the not too distant future.)  Let us consider a scenario in which Mexico was a major military power, and decided it wanted control of our oil, gas, seaports.  Should the US accede to Mexican demands that Texas be released from its unification with the rest of the US?..The difference is but one:  We have the military strength to treat such a demand with derision.  Ukraine does not.  Well, there are no states neighboring Russia that have the military capacity to withstand a Russian military onslaught, and Putins ambitions have no bounds.  Do we let them all go?  If not, where do we take a stand?..With the first so threatened.  Otherwise, there will be a second, then a third . . . and Putin will laugh, and laugh, and grow more convinced of his and Russias invincibility, of its right and capacity to defeat the West...We stop him now.  Or surrender Europe.","The maneuvering and mouthing of meaningless phrases from the lexicon of diplomacy accomplished nothing except the appearance of the possibility of agreement where none exists...Bluntly:  Putin wants nothing less than the annexation of eastern Ukraine, and Putin never stops pursuing his ambitions.  This has nothing to do with how the Russian minority -- it is a minority -- in that area have been treated by Kiev.  It is simply political.  Putin believes that, if he achieves this goal, he will be in a position to prevent the remainder of the Ukraine aligning with the West.  He will know that he can, at any time, take the rest under his protection and so prevent that -- and the West will do nothing but wring its hands and hold more meaningless meetings...The Baltics are next.  27 of Latvia' population are ethnic Russians . . . about half that of the citizens in the disputed Ukrainian territory.  Don't they deserve protection by their homeland?..Putin is reestablishing a Russian empire.  He will not be stopped by words.  He might be stopped economically, but out NATO allies balk at complete isolation, whimpering over the damage their economies might suffer.  Well:  Might they suffer more when Estonia, Moldova, fall into Putin's empire?  Belarus, with only a small fraction of ethnic Russians, is almost an autocracy, its leadership favoring Russian alignment.  Then:  Why not Romania?..We stop Putin now.  Or we accede to a new Russian Empire."

You have heard me say this before  its my long-standing theory, which takes the place of a political philosophy...People who perceive the world as a crowded place believe that government has a very important role to play. They see it in action every day  enforcing the law, directing traffic, removing garbage and providing clean water. Theyre also likely to witness the inequality of the world and they want government to at least make the divisions less painful...The current crop of Republicans, especially the Tea Party types, see the world as an empty place, where people can take care of themselves and government exists only to levy taxes and get in their way. Given the fact that the country is becoming increasingly crowded, I dont think you can define that as a message of change...We can't fix that, but we can ultimately rationalize our way past it!","It is certain that China and India won't be used by Putin, but it is absolutely certain that China and India will be USING Putin to achieve their interests.    Either way, Putin will be problematic for the US (until he realizes that, in the long run, integration with 'the west' is his best option).",China will 'adopt' Russia and use it to forward it's own interests.

As a fully 'unregulated capitalist' his interest is in wealth and power and a place on the world stage.     He's not about souls, civilization, humanity, or friendship, and never will be for more than the moment it takes to get other people's stuff.","Putin is simply taking advantage of the fact that Republican doctrine has made the US appear divided, weak, and foolish in the eyes of the rest of the world...For him, Crimea trumps religion, abortion, homophobia, poverty, and human life, in general.    He may use those social phobias to 'pump up his base', but his eye is clearly focused on the money, and wealth to be had by him, his relatives, and his pay-to-play oligarchs.",Putin would fit well on the Republican primary stage.,"OK, so the Russian army inside of Ukraine knows that they have the election 'locked up'.      Putin needs Ukraine to distract from the disaster that he's created in Russia.  ..The question that's becoming more and more critical is:   why can't the people around the globe who want democracy get democracy?;  too many special interests?;  too much cultural fragmentation?;  too many centuries of being run over?;  deep rooted anti-democratic sentiments within the culture itself?;   all  of the above;  or, what?","Putin may be pulling his troops away from the border, in order to remove himself and Russia from the equation while the insurrectionists he's planted in Ukraine spend the next year or two seeding the takeover, or just 'pull a GOP' and rig an election asap."

Robert Jennings,,,,"I am very interested in Economic sanctions have worked against Russia; but Putin is ignoring the hardship that sanctions are causing Russian citizens. So far, except for some predictable wishful thinking I have seen no evidence that the sanctions are having any detrimental effect on Russia. On the contrary they apear to be aiding Russia to make some internal economic changes that will be beneficial to the Russian economy and Russia turning East will strengthen the country.",There is little real difficulty in predicting Mr. Putin's next moves. So far it seems that he has largely been reacting to 'Western' moves vis-a-vis Ukraine. These have included: -.(1) The EU promoting a bilateral trade treaty with major negative implications for the Ukrainian economy; Mr Putin reacted by pointing out to the Ukrainian President the consequences for Ukraine of loss of trade with Russia and of subsidised Gas from Russia. The Ukrainian President decided not to sign the trade deal and asked for trilateral negotiations which would be to the benefit of Ukraine. The EU refused..(2) Arranging a coup d tate in Ukraine in 2014;  Mr Putin reacted to protect his Black Sea Naval base by encouraging the secession of Crimea from Ukraine and its eventual absorption by Russia.(3) Encouraging the Kiev regime to attack anti-Kiev secessionist regions of Ukraine - primarily in the East and thus fomenting a Civil War. Mr. Putin reacted by providing some support to the anti-Kiev forces  many of whom are ethnically Russian..(4) Creating a false scare about Russian intentions and an opening for NATO to move beyond its competence and sound endless war drums. Mr. Putin has responded by banging his own drums.Exercise control over Western moves and designs and you automatically influence Mr. Putin's moves and designs,His military was indirectly involved in downing a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine.So far there is no evidence of that statement. Assertions by the USA State Department are not evidence and are suspicious given that the USA has the technology to provide incontrovertible evidence should it choose to do so..Perhaps Mr. Friedman means that a Russian made missile brought down the Malaysian airliner? We do know that these missiles are in the hands of all sides of the conflict in Ukraine. Is it too much to ask that OP ED contributors to the NYT stay within the truth?.Could we not just agree that V. Putin is a dictatorial oligarch with a murky past and spare the pop psychology?,"It is very difficult to understand what is driving events in Ukraine. Whilst most of the Western Media are content with a Putin is a baddie Rationale there is little analysis of the role and objectives of the United States maybe the State Department flying solo? and the European Union..There is ample evidence that the United States was active in driving the coup that caused the flight of the elected President.That Coup coincided with lethal fire which killed quite a number of People (Rioters and Police). There is credible evidence that live fire was by agents provocateur connected with the coup regime.One hypothesis I have heard is that the USA wishes to break off a piece of Ukraine, in Kosovo-like fashion; this would be the Western part with a historical fascist DNA. That seems to be the current tendency, since members of the fascist parties previously condemned as such by the EU Parliament, are installed in the Coup regime..If these are taken into consideration then President Putin is doing no more than reacting to events rather than driving them..Last night I participated in a discussion on this whole issue and for the first time I heard the notion of the USA, eyeing Kaliningrad also. So may we now expect some destabilisation activity in Lithuania and Poland?.Comment, and editorials, might be better, and the Ukrainian people spared much bloodshed if there was some attempt at reasoned and balanced discussion on Ukraine.","A one-size fits all approach is a mistake. The Ukraine crisis is as follows: -.1.	The EU was ready to sign a neighbourhood agreement with President Yanukovych of Ukraine..2.	He backed out because it would be bad for all of Ukraine.3.	He suggested a trilateral agreement to suit all stakeholders..4.	The EU refused this approach which would be to the benefit of all Ukrainians..5.	The USA State Department initiated a coup that caused President Yanukovych to run away..6.	The Coup regime comprised a number of fascists previously denounced by vote of the European Parliament..7.	Many people in East Ukraine denounced the Kiev Regime and proclaimed themselves anti-Kiev.8.	President Yanukovych still retains the legitimate signature recognised by the EU earlier.9.	The situation is now spiralling out of control..The above does not need to mention Russia or Putin as a driver of events. Russian involvement has been largely in reaction to USA and EU provocations andor blunders.","The following facts that can be checked on-line to assist the confused..1.	The EU refused President Yanukovychs request to negotiate a three way trade agreement with Ukraines main economic partners EU and Russia.2.	The USA state Department  led by Ms Victoria Nuland  midwifed a coup d'tat  in February 2014 involving members of the Svoboda party.3.	There is evidence that the causalities in the Maidan were shot by pro coup agents.4.	The World Jewish Congress has demanded that Svoboda be banned. The  was condemned by the EUs own European Parliament in a motion on Dec. 13, 2012. The text  states: Parliament goes on to express concern about the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine, expressed in support for the Svoboda Party, which, as a result, is one of the two new parties to enter the Verkhovna Rada. It recalls that racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic views go against the EUs fundamental values and principles and therefore appeals to pro-democratic parties in the Verkhovna Rada not to associate with, endorse or form coalitions with this party..5.	Ukrainians living in the Eastern part of Ukraine rejected the coup d'tat and organised against it with the help of Russia.6.	Members of Svoboda are heavily engaged in the Civil War in the form of a privately financed militia..7.	President Putin has largely been reacting to events in the Ukraine. These events are being driven largely by Western interference in Ukraine affairs..Peace in Ukraine is most important.","As Konstantin Sonin, vice rector of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow is quoted in the article as saying I think we make too much rationalization of what the Kremlin does. I think they were very much driven by events. This whole series of events was not about Putin as the Western corporate media wishes to pretend  it was driven by a craven EU chagrin at Ukrainian President daring to prefer better terms for his people than the vicious austerity policy of the EU  and a long term plan by the USA State Department to destabilise Ukraine.","like his Ukrainian intervention.Russia reacted in Ukraine to an USA managed coup dtat that installed a fascist government which provoked the current Civil War. Some Western Countries are becoming aware of the massive refugee crisis that may soon spread westward from this Civil War. Already over one million refugees have fled to Russia. The Fascist Government is currently arranging the overthrow of the Ukrainian President .  the Russian economy were not grimly stagnant and likely to remain so .According to most informed economists (those who do not take their facts from Western Corporate propaganda) the Russian Economy should recover from the Oil Price collapse and return to modest growth  modest in this case meaning a higher growth rate than the American economy.. American hawks fear a repeat of Putins Crimea gambit in the Baltic states.American hawks fear nothing of the sort. They are well aware that this fear is part of their own propaganda machine  designed to scare Eastern European Countries into increasing their military budgets and justify continued USA military expenditure... to be clear: Putin is a Russian nationalist.Yes and much more than that, closest western example might be General De Gaulle former French President who was not at all inclined to bow the knee to the USA.

If there ever was a time in history for the people of that region to leave wouldn't it be now.","Well, is anyone really surprised at all with this latest tidbit of information. Masked men in new uniforms and driving vehicles with Russian license plates took over the Crimean peninsula as the rest of the world watched in disbelief that Mr. Putin would be so brash as to broker this type of behavior. There is no surprise either that most of the countries that were formerly under the thumb of the Soviet's are scrambling as fast as they can to become NATO members. So here we are in the twenty first century trying so hard to overcome poverty, crop failures, and economic woes worldwide, and yet there are nation's that spend their people's fortunes on weapons designed for destruction, and any nation in their sights is a fair game for their fifteenth century mentality.","We live on one beautiful planet which was a gift to us all. Can you just imagine the planets we might have already seen if our nation's could just stop imposing their rules over others. Ruling other lands with weapons of destruction does not make for good neighbors. How is it that Russia could have gotten along so well  with the Ukraine since the break up of the soviet union, and then suddenly and swiftly march their troops across their border and proclaim to the world that their hooliganism is back and stronger than ever. Perhaps Mr. Putin and the Russian people have forgotten what it was like to have foreign troops do the same to them.","Russia helped break the back of Nazi Germany. If I recollect they had a larger supporting cast from the west who also supplied the Russian's with food clothing, and arms to achieve that goal. Without hesitation Russian annexed most of Eastern Europe without a gasp after the war was won, reaping havoc on most of the nation's who would protest their presence in their lands. How quick is the forgetting from Mr. Putin what it was like to have foreign troops marching in his own land.","Shouldn't Chechnya now be offered the same right's of separation that Crimea just instituted? If the Russian's have such a disregard for the law's of the land of other nation's then how can they expect to rule outside of their own, and where oh where did these russian militia's get their weapons from if not russia? Annexing territories, who would have thought Putin would come up with a scheme like that.","Do you honestly think that Washington, or Adams, or Jefferson would really give a hoot as to Mr. Putin's demeanor. Russia is doing what it has been doing for centuries, tormenting their neighbors with their brand of friendship. Mr. Putin's memory cells must be blocked out however as I remember my grandfather building liberty ships that became part of never ending convoys of food and supplies headed for his land during WWII.",This was a well orchestrated and planned armed invasion of a neighboring country that has been a good neighbor to Russia and it's people.

He was shocked by Ukraine's demands for clean elections in 2004, and horrified by the Arab spring uprisings: it was all to easy for him to imagine himself in the place of those toppled dictators.  If a day comes when Russians can look across their frontier and see fellow former-Soviet Slavs living with freedom and prosperity, Russia's present strong-man style of rule will be finished...This Comments thread will fill with harsh attacks against you, by some of the many apologists and defenders of Putin.  Their attacks will only confirm the truthfulness of what you have written.","One meaning of think is to hold an opinion.  Thinker would do well to gather facts before forming opinions...1. The government in Kyiv was not thrown out in a coup.  The democratically elected parliament voted freely on its own initiative to depose a single officer, the president.  The parliament, prime minister and cabinet all remained in place: that is no overthrow of government!..2. Apologists for Putin never acknowledge that there WAS a genuine coup d'etat in Ukraine:  this occurred in the capital of Crimea, where a force of armed men including active-duty Russian soldiers occupied the Crimean parliament and council of ministers.  With these armed foreign troops STANDING IN THE CHAMBER, the parliament voted to dismiss Crimea's government and to replace its prime minister.  THAT WAS A COUP, UNDER THE GUNS OF AN OCCUPYING FOREIGN POWER...3. The referendum was a sham in numerous dimensions.  Compare point-by-point how it was conducted, with the Scotland independence referendum conducted a few months later.  EVERYTHING that was done in Scotland to ensure that referendum was lawful, valid and democratic was omitted in Crimea, which in any case was already under full-scale occupation by Russian armed forces...YES, IT WAS MILITARY FORCE.  We don't just Think so.  The facts speak.",,,,,,,
J. Cornelio,,,,"Let Putin have it, not just Crimea but if he wants it and can beat the natives for it, the Ukraine as well...These testosterone-driven, adolescent games of the world's great powers for every inch of worthless territory are pathetic...If Putin's autocratic, religiously inspired ideals of righteousness and manly power proves to be less appealing to the human animal than the West's obscenely materialistic and greedily solipsistic paean to individual spirit, then he will lose and we will win...Or maybe not.","I understand what Putin achieves domestically by stirring up the passions of tribalistic jingoism (that works everywhere -- remember freedom fries?).  But what does he achieve internationally?  Annexing a couple of states for which the term basket cases applies in spades.  Or is it weakening andor angering nearby states on which Russia depends for foreign trade?..Moreover, whatever the shortcomings of Western ideas (and there are plenty), it still tends to be more appealing to the human spirit where, at least theoretically, everyone has the option of obtaining the kind of obscene amounts of wealth and power which Putin's Russia reserves for the .1 (oh wait, maybe I better drop that argument).","FINALLY!..A straightforward, intelligent, jingoistic-free analysis of the power politics involved with Putin's invasion...Too bad reason is the pet poodle to our worst instincts (fear, tribalism, etc).  If, instead, it were reversed maybe we'd stop shooting ourselves in the foot and better figure out when, why and if our adversaries are doing the same.","FINALLY!..A straightforward, intelligent, jingoistic-free analysis of the power politics involved with Putin's invasion...Too bad reason is the pet poodle to our worst instincts (fear, tribalism, etc).

Moreover, as the desire to juice to the ratings which politics-as-sport guarantees, virtually all media outlets have learned the Murdoch's empire lesson---US versus THEM sells!..So, Putin hold us in contempt because we have proved contemptible---unable to evolve to a point where our reason is capable of harnessing our fears and our hatreds and our anger.",,,,,
Mike Halpern,,,,Putin must be pinching himself with disbelief. All he has to do is say neo-Nazi and NATO and half the posters on these Ukraine blogs are practically begging him to restore the old Soviet Empire.,"Before all the references to neo-Nazis, peaceful referendum (imagine that, 99.6  of the people want to be ruled by Moscow), western imperialism, as personified by Victoria Nuland, no Russian soldier has come anywhere within Ukraine, Putin is a man who loves peace and democracy, allow me to  say that this betrayal of Ukraine by the west is of a piece with the pre-ww2 betrayal of Czechoslovakia - and add a personal plea: those who condemn Israeli land theft, but turn a blind eye to the Russian variety, spare us the phony nobility of your self-evident double standards.","Let's for a moment grant the premise of so many posts here that Putin is a peace-loving democrat who was forced into the ways and byways of land theft by the evil machinations of the US. Aside from acceding to the principle that two wrongs make a right, those posters who truly believe this may not be aware that their sentiments exactly echo those of the westerners who used to assert that the Soviet Union has a right to take control of all of eastern Europe to protect (by forming a ring of buffer states that gallantly left it to the Poles etc. to absorb the blow) the Motherland from a revanchist West Germany.  Now its supposed to be a predatory NATO that needs protecting against. Who can blame Putin: in his wildest dreams he probably couldn't imagine how much mileage, i.e. someone else's territory, could be gotten just by repeating ad infinitum neo-Nazi and Victoria Nuland.","What if the situation were reversed, and the US announced an intention to annex Canadian territory and sent volunteers from the armed forces to carry out the job; would all the posters here who justify Putin's land theft by proclaiming that it's Russia's sphere of influence, so what's the big deal take a similar blas attitude to an American assertion of its supposed sphere of influence rights?","What crime has Putin committed?..By your lights, clearly none. Is that because you see annexing some other country's territory, as long as its done by progressive forces, as not a crime but as a boon to civilization? Or is land theft, even by non-progressive forces, something for which you just happen to have a soft spot?","A working assumption by many here is that criticizing Putin implies that the critic is a rightwing neo-con blinded by patriotism to the US. No way to prove this charge, of course, but that never stopped posters from making it. However, what's more important than the implied insult is the corollary that Putin has a right to conduct an expansionist foreign policy because of US actions. I don't see anything comparable to annexation in current US policy, but let's by hypothesis grant the premise of American wrongdoing: why is the argument that Putin then has carte blanche supposed to be convincing on anything but two wrongs make a right grounds, and why are the people of countries bordering on Russia supposed to pay the price for supposed US perfidy, exactly as they paid the same price in the heyday of the Soviet empire?","I think the Israeli settlers have made a strategic error in the way they justify their continued quest to steal the West Bank. They would do better to take a leaf from some of the pro-Putin posts here, i.e. it may look like land theft, but its actually done to 1) create harmony between peoples, 2) foster world peace, 3) teach the bankers a lesson, 4) preserve the spoken and written language and, most important of all, 5) encourage democracy. If the settlers could let these phrases trickle out of their mouth with the same relish evidenced by the Putin is right to steal eastern Ukraine brigade of posters, these erstwhile land thieves could become the vanguard of a new world order for revolutionary change and betterment, or something.","This is truly masterful on Putin's part and his old comrades in the KGB must be saying I knew he was really great. People here are debating whether he is sincere about a referendum etc., meanwhile it's just accepted by some here, and not just the posters from Russia, that the annexation of Crimes was the most natural thing in the world and we should turn that page with nary a backward glance..Other countries must be regarding with envy the ease with which Russian territory is increased at one fell swoop of land theft. If Mr. Putin is the nice guy some people seem to think, maybe he'll do a struggling humanity a big favor and author one of those how-to tomes: Land Theft and Annexation for Dummies.","Why, even if it is true, is this being cheered by some  as showing Putin's peaceful intent? He has already dismembered Ukraine, and he can count on the Sunday referendum being one of those 97 votes in favor of actual or virtual separation from Kiev. If the tally is anything below 95 he will doubtless claim voter intimidation and begin further direct dismemberment of Ukraine. At the very worst from his perspective, he has already annexed Crimea essentially for free, but even if he steals no more territory he can bask in a geopolitical version of the Stockholm Syndrome, i.e. thank you Mr. Putin, O gallant man of peace, for knowing when to stop all the theft.","Yes, things are back to normal here. The obligatory fascist and Victoria Nuland references, and now a new supposed dagger thrust at the west: NATO as historically as much an offensive as defensive alliance. Why can't these posters simply come clean and own up to the fact that they yearn for the old Soviet empire, and can't cheer Putin enough for trying to resurrect it and for teaching those neo-cons, neo-Nazis, and neo-fascists, i.e. anybody who doesn't rejoice at Putin's Greater Russia intentions, a lesson once and for all?"
Nick,,,,"Beyond their dependence on Russian gas, Europe has become the playground and piggybank of the Russian elite. Mainstream parties are worried about losing Russian business. The left wing ignores any wrongdoing that can not be blamed on the US or Israel. The right wing loves Putin because he is openly racist, homophobic, and antagonizes the Americans.","It is a well-rehearsed script. Ossetia and Abkhazia broke away from Georgia, Pridnestrovie is trying to part with Moldova, Nagorny Karabakh is torn between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Buffer zones is the kremlin's strategy of NATO opposition.(same strategy was used by russian empire) Debaltseve is necessary for Putin to unite Donetsk and Lugansk into Novorossia - Ukrainian version of a conflicting territory serving as a buffer zone for a Russian regime. Pro-russian sentiment is strong in these eastern territories especially now after conflict claimed thousands of lives..Europe is ready to accept this scenario as they are in need of Russia for their own economic well being. They are gaining western ukraine as a new member state..USA however is interested in continuing this conflict as the sanctions are hurting Europe much more than US, giving it economic advantage..Ukraine's viability depends on IMF(read USA) financing as they are very close to default and economic collapse, so they are likely to follow through with American's preference of continuation of this conflict.","Putin is analogous to a 9-year-old holding an active grenade.  Trying to lay the blame for this debacle at America's feet is both inaccurate and defeatist.  Russia's foreign policy is greatly destabilizing not just to the security of the region but to the humanistic goals of free trade and free communication between and within nations.  ..If we want Eastern Europe (or the world for that matter) to reflect those values instead of the feudal values that Russia represents, then we should take direct action in helping Ukraine repel the Russian invaders...Not that I think that's what will happen.  Instead, Western EuropeAmerica will give Putin a load of concessions in hopes of 'defusing' the situation.  But giving Czechoslovakia to Hitler didn't satiate him and South Ossetia, the Crimea, and eastern Ukraine won't satiate Putin.  ..And the NEXT time Putin maneuvers to acquire more territory, there will still be confused Russian shills like CK here saying it's America's fault.",Obama needs to back his words up to make sure that Russia gets the message. We need to immediately deploy forces to Poland and Turkey to make sure that Putin knows we are ready and willing to intervene.,"2. Uniquely, Ukraine holds the key to the destruction of Putin. ..Strange as it may seem, Ukraine is the most dangerous country for Putin's rule. Not militarily, not economically, but internally.  It stirs something in a Russian soul that he has worked decades to suppress -- the rebellion.  Against thuggish rulers, corruption, robbery, suppression of all freedoms, and misery. Of all countries, Ukraine is the one most like Russia. Culture, traditions, history, and even language is the same. It's a mirror image. When Russians look at Ukrainians, they see themselves. So far they have been together, but now their histories have diverged. The Ukrainians decided they had enough. They rose up, and they kicked the thugs out. ..What happens now is of utmost importance. Entire Russia is watching.  If they like what they see, it is the end of Putin. This is why it is of utmost importance for Putin to NOT let Russians see this for what it is. This is why there is such an onslaught of disinformation about what's happening. It's a matter of life and death...The best what West can do is to make Kiev into a beacon. Help it build a normal society -- with freedoms, free elections, and fairness. That's what Ukraine wants for itself anyway, and now has the momentum to create. ..If Russia sees this, it will follow. If Kiev's rebellion is crushed, it will send a grave message across  Europe. The cold war will set in. Decades will be lost in tensions and confrontations. Generations will be lost.",Obama needs to back his words up to make sure that Russia gets the message.

Michael Stavsen,,,,"In accordance with this logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar al-Assad who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent civilians. According to the transcript Obama went on to say When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation's internal affairs, it breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all..However while the world has watched for over 2 years now as Assad has dropped his barrel bombs and thought that it was a war crime of the greatest and most severe magnitude, the world has also watched how the one person who could have demanded that it stop was seemingly not effected by it at all..When Assad dared to cross Obama's personal red line, Obama had no problem ordering ships to within their missiles striking distance to Syria, and made threats that Assad took most seriously..If Obama took as seriously the mass murder of tens of thousands as he took Assad's audacity to violate his red line surely he would demanded that if Assad does not stop the bombings he will call back those same ships with their missiles with the ability to inflict serious harm on Assad..But he did no such thing. His plan for these bombings is to stand by silently and say nothing and do nothing about them and that they shall go on for the foreseeable future..So this criticism is both false and insincere. It is a desperate last word while Putin pushes him aside and takes his place in the world's fight against ISIS.","After years of Obama doing nothing in Syria all he has to offer is his criticism of Putin who is ready to take concrete action in both the fight against ISIS and in the war in Syria at the invitation of the parties in the region..Obama's critique; that he believes that Assad must go.  He is at this stage no more than an arm chair critic, one that has no plan of his own, but is merely there to disagree with the policies of others, others that are ready and set to act..So Putin is once again going to push him aside in Syria and take command of the situation. He will be the one who will be providing the air power and more so that those on the ground can get their fight on..This will be not just in Syria but in Iraq also where both the Iraqi government along with general Sulemani from Iran have entered into an agreement with Russia to fight ISIS..This is the general who had the only success at ousting ISIS from a city in Iraq, but when he needed some air support Obama ordered his forces leave while the American bombing took place..And the Iraqi government who had Shiite forces ready to go in and retake Mosul and Anbar, is done with taking orders from Obama not to fight unless they use Sunni fighters that do not exist.So while Putin along with Iraq, the Kurds and Iran finally give ISIS the fight the world has been waiting for, Obama will fade into history as the president who made the US irrelevant, useless and unreliable in the most important region of the world.","Putin does need Obama to work with him. He has reached agreements with the Iraqi's, Iranians and Syria. And Obama is not just irrelevant to Putin. He proved himself to be incapable and incompetent when in regard to the whole of the middle east. Of course he may just be incapable and incompetent in general.","Obama repeatedly stating his view that Assad should leave office is so far removed from the current reality that it amounts to simply saying that he has no idea what he thinks ought to be done..Is it Obama's position that he want for Assad's government to fall and for the militants to take over all of Syria, which is what Putin is trying to prevent..Does he not see who the parties to the conflict are, that they are pretty much all Islamist that are not against Assad personally but against the whole old order of secular rule. That they want the current government as a whole to be gone and to be replaced by them taking control..As such the two sides in this conflict are the government, which represents order and governance by a competent and responsible authority, and the other side are a bunch of different militias that share in common only that they want the governing power to disappear. After which the real fighting between those groups will begin over who shall take control. In short the two sides are government and order vs. a total breakdown in all order and complete chaos..Obama's strategy in Syria to create a fantasy group of fighters that are neither for or against Assad has produced a total of several fighters. After displaying such laughable incompetence he deserves what Putin is doing to him, which is to make a mockery of him on the world stage.","No, us Americans are fully capable of acting with decisiveness. It is Obama who decided to do nothing. And that is because he had better things to do, like doing a deal with Iran, and trying to win the Nobel by getting the Israelis and Palestinians to finally reach a deal. Thing is he thought he would get away with it and nobody would notice. But now Putin comes and shows the whole world how Obama failed to attend to his main responsibility as president.","The reality is that the US is not at all active in Syria, nor does it have any policy as to what should be done there. The only thing that they keep on repeating is that Assad must go, but they do not bother to explain how they want this to happen, and this is because they themselves have no idea how and who should make him go..Is the US policy that it wishes to see the rebel groups defeat Assad and occupy the areas that are currently held by the government in the same way that they occupy the areas that they hold now. That all of Syria should be a patchwork of different areas, each held by a different rebel group, meaning that everyone from Nusra to ISIS to secular groups shall seize an area, after which they will continue to fight among each other for years over control of Syria..It is their belief that once they take over all of Syria they will all come together, secular and Islamist alike to form a functioning democracy, or do they think that the Islamists would prevail in setting up an Islamist state with hardcore Sharia law and a state that will rival the Islamic State in its hatred for all things western..Clearly this is not the outcome they want to see, yet they insist that taking action that will prevent this outcome is a terrible thing.

It would be the US that  would be accusing Russia of supporting the illegal overthrow of a democratically elected government, as Putin did of the US, and are recognizing this illegitimate government because they don't care for the people of Ukraine, and are more concerned about their own geo political condition..The US would probably go on a campaign of isolating the new government, probably with sanctions as a start. Then there would be talk of the military option."

Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev worked together hand in hand to make the world a safer place. All that effort thrown away over poor decisions and no communication..I did not support President Obama for office, however, I absolutely thought he would do a better job than I have witnessed. Putin has done for Russia what is correct and within the Russian sphere of influence. Our country in trying to punish Russia has punished the world..Le us go beyond our parochial interests and work with strong partners to achieve our desired results, not with the vacillating group of countries known as Nato and Europe.","Your analogy is perhaps more appropriate than you intended. ..The United States had invaded Cuba, and it was that failed invasion that sent Cuba scrambling to the USSR for a nuclear deterrent. In turn, the Soviet Union had invaded and annexed Eastern Europe and maintained malignant puppet regimes for many decades. Ask the citizens of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, etc. how they trust the Russian bear, emboldened as it is by NATO's fecklessness and driven by an increasingly rabid nationalistic fervor, all the easier to foment with the elimination of rational dissent. Russia has wetted its appetite for territorial expansion and, as grey as the situation is in Ukraine (and South Ossetia), Putin has learned of its optical value to a propaganda-addled population. ..This is not a benign power the West is dealing with. Despite the apologists on left and right in Europe and America, Russia is testing the waters for further intimidation and (unless we resolve to stop it) expansion. This defensive measure is a small assurance. No one in their right mind believes that these forces will be used in an offensive capacity. However, it must be made absolutely clear that any Russian activity on NATO soil is an act of war and will be met with the combined might of the alliance. ..Just like Cuba in the 60s, Eastern Europe today has sought defensive alliances to protect itself from invasion. Let us honor our commitments.","Putin should also call upon his own government to hold a free and fair referendum in Chechnya and Dagistan calling for sovereignty or independence from Russia.

Henryk,,,,Putin is talking about the fifth column organized by the West in Russia and in the meantime the Russian news channel Vremya asks people of Russian origins in Ukraine to revolt against the government in Kiev.,"President Obama touched on the most important aspect of the US-Russia relations. This is about values, not about how many tanks or aircrafts the US sends to Eastern Europe. ..Mr. Bremmer, how hard is that to understand that Russia plays in Eastern Europe a role of an oppressive tyrant who always tries to impose its will on its weaker neighbors, as happened in Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968? President Obama simply said, that the US will support anti-tyrrant and anti-imperialist uprisings such as the two mentioned above, Polish Solidarity movement or Ukrainian revolution in 201314. These uprisings may not win immediatelly but will succeed in a longer run, because democracy and freedom is posed to win against a Soviet-style tyranny. ..Very good speech by president Obama. Compare it to the last week ramblings by Mr. Putin about restoration of the Soviet Union and how big mistake it was to dismember the evil empire.","The Kiev government, please, catch the bearded man and few others and make a permanent show in the media. I want to see Lavrov denouncing the bearded guy as a foreign agent...For everyone following the story, yes, this is how the eastern block looked on the inside. The difference is that now we have much better access to information and the whole world may contemplate the cynical machiavelian play by Putin and his comrades. Their only doctrine was and is the concentration of power in Moscow and this is what Putin calls his patriotism.","Putin is a heir of Russian imperialism and the 9th of May is an annual occasion to celebrate Russian imperailism and increasing chauvanism.  RussianSoviet imperial forces were used in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslavakia in 1968, in Lithunania in 1990 not to fight fascism, but to fight with freedom and maintain Russian imperial interests. ..The only good think is that Russia is economically very weak, in comparative terms perhaps it is Russia's weakest moment in modern history. Cold War II, if happens, will be won by the West.","Putin will stop, if the Administration shows the iron will. There is no need to send troops to Ukraine. Ukrainians need political support and if it turns into war, some military equipment. In the Belbek incident, where unarmed Ukrainian airmen confronted Russian soldiers, Ukrainians were shouting America is with us. The Administration should make clear that indeed it stands behind the Ukrainians, behind promises made in 1994.","I am not getting this narrative. The dramatic events started from a desire of a certain section of Ukrainian society to get back on track the process of integration with the European Union. The reasons are pretty clear: western neighbours of Ukraine such as Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, develop much more efficiently than the totalitarian regimes such as Russia. I am sure the same people will insist on the continuation of the process of integration with Europe. For Putin the outcome is the alternative: either intervene and eliminate the pro-European forces, probably with help of tanks or agree that Ukraine will at the moment drift towards the West (it may change in the future). This is essentially a loose-loose situation for Mr. Putin and I am not seeing here any farsighted strategy in what Russia is doing in Crimea, except of uniting the whole Europe againt Putin and increasing electoral chances of nationalist in Ukraine.","There are certainly extremists among the protesters. This is always the case and was the case in 1980 during essentially non-violent Solidarity rebelion as well as in 1989, when countries of Eastern Europe left the Soviet block. The extremists have their 5 minutes during the change from an autocracy to democracy, at least it seems to be the rule in this part of the world. All of these extreme parties vanished from the political scene in Poland, in other countries play some marginal role. Hopefully the same will happen in Ukraine. ..Regarding current government, nazi or not, they decided to appoint one Israeli citizen to be a governor of Dniepropietrovsk region. This is exactly this citizen, about whom mister Putin was so eloquently talking for three minutes yesterday, apparently because according to Mr. Putin he stolen some money from one of the Putin's olgarchs.","Thanks for this comment. There are some differences comparing to 1968. First of all Putin is much weaker than Brezhnev. Moreover, minor soviet satraps such as general Jaruzelski of Poland are no longer present in politics. As a result Western and Central Ukraine cannot be attacked without a big military effort, probably very unpopular with Russian public. Furthermore, the Putin regime would be weakened by a not very sucesful Ukrainian campaign and this may lead to a change of power in Moscow. I am not convinced that he is willing to take the risk. Destabilizing Ukraine, sending men with rifles, supporting another pro-Russian politician - yes, sending tanks - not likely, in particular because many of the tanks would be lost in the campaign.","Thanks for this comment.

Furthermore, the Putin regime would be weakened by a not very sucesful Ukrainian campaign and this may lead to a change of power in Moscow. I am not convinced that he is willing to take the risk. Destabilizing Ukraine, sending men with rifles, supporting another pro-Russian politician - yes, sending tanks - not likely, in particular because many of the tanks would be lost in the campaign.","I am not getting this narrative. The dramatic events started from a desire of a certain section of Ukrainian society to get back on track the process of integration with the European Union. The reasons are pretty clear: western neighbours of Ukraine such as Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, develop much more efficiently than the totalitarian regimes such as Russia. I am sure the same people will insist on the continuation of the process of integration with Europe. For Putin the outcome is the alternative: either intervene and eliminate the pro-European forces, probably with help of tanks or agree that Ukraine will at the moment drift towards the West (it may change in the future). This is essentially a loose-loose situation for Mr. Putin and I am not seeing here any farsighted strategy in what Russia is doing in Crimea, except of uniting the whole Europe againt Putin and increasing electoral chances of nationalist in Ukraine."
John Meakin,,,,"This was a very poorly thought out revolution, which immediately triggered a response from Ukrainians who did not want their government overthrown by  insurgents.. Their response was entirely predictable as was Putin's who was faced with a very hostile group setting up shop on Russia's border...The insurgents were immediately welcomed in Washington by Obama himself which is a strange way to treat people who had just overthrown a legitimately elected, if distasteful, government..So far we have a lot of news about PutinRussia but a virtual news blackout regarding the group or groups that were responsible for the initial action and the counter insurgency that has followed and what their aims and objectives are.","Putin's strength is that he is likely to be seen in the ME as an honest broker with no history of double dealing or intrigue. A RussianChinese base in Syria will stabilise the area and also deter hotheaded incursions by other powers which could ignite another futile and devastating war, which surely nobody wants..Whether this is a good development or not depends on whose side you are on, but it's a workable one with few realistic alternatives.","The simple conclusion that one must come to is that the revolutionaries have not only failed in their task but have created a much bigger problem than, perhaps, existed before..We have no imformation on who the revolutionaries are, or what their aims and objectives were ,because the Press has preferred to carefully work  around these issues..The problem now is that the revolutionaries will be dealing with fellow Ukrainians who are not likely to forget what happened for a very long time...The natural  cultural gravitation towards Russia is not something Putin has engineered but is what should have been expected..The concerted effort to turn the EU against Russia will go nowhere...the people of Europe are not interested in never ending  economic wars...The people who started this now have a big  tiger by the tail.","It's worth remembering that the tragic events in Ukraine were started by persons overthrowing a properly ,if distasteful to many,elected government and then moving quickly to install a government more the their liking...Not surprisingly, many people were unhappy with this way of doing things and particularly with  the importation of mercenaries to muddy the water further...This activity has created a threat on Russia's doorstep and one would have to be very nave to think that Putin was not going to respond.",,,,,,

For his sake I hope Mr. Putin continues to find him useful.,"The US lost enormous credibility and the good will of most of the world with its unilateral invasion of Iraq and botched occupation, and the strategic and tactical failures in Afghanistan during the Bush administration.  The US has spent many dollars, time and energy just to get back on an even footing after the Neocon Era...Sen. McCain has written a very interesting column.  His opening paragraphs read like more like an attack on the isolationist libertarian philosophy espoused by Sen. Paul 's father than an attack on Pres. Obama's policies.  And much of what Sen.

There's more to life than complaining. ..Undoubtedly, non-Isis interests can unify (enemy of my enemy) and roll back violent Islamic extremism as a singular goal. After that, back to complaining.","It must be devastating for Putin to be considered insincere stateside after his heartfelt letter to US citizenry published by the NYT last fall. Surely he is concerned our famously short attention span has gotten the better of otherwise sound judgement.

In Iraq, the US backs Iraq and Iran to preserve a Shia-dominated regime while in Syria it backs Sunni insurgencies bent on taking down a Shia-affiliated Iran-backed regime...Putin catalyzed the deaths of many and displacement of millions in Syria? Maybe he's jealous of the damage done and catalyzed by the US in Iraq and Libya to name only two examples...Can the US stop Putin from doing what he wants? Oh, I know. How about threatening to rename The Russian Tea Room?","If Putin opts for an invasion, the post-invasion legal framework under international law can be guided or at least inspired by arguments raised by the US and the UK to defend the legality of the second Iraq invasion.","It all seems driven by PR. They weren't really Russian troops, the USEU didn't tacitly provoke the revolution etc. On the assumption Putin doesn't want a PR nightmare, the EU should move faster to put on the ground the political equivalent of the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, a large OSCE observer presence in Eastern and Southern Ukraine. Unless it's considered risky, members of the EU parliament should also take rotating shifts on the frontlines of the contested areas.

This obfuscation serves the perpetrators of inaccurate language in their agendas. In the Ukraine situation, meaning-less language (words detached from reality) are useful in triggering or avoiding triggering of the basic human animal fight or flight response. Putin uses language to trigger a fight response among his constituency. The West uses language to avoid a fight response and even a flight response, the latter being self-awareness and admission that one is running away from a problem.","I remember reading about how many years and how many billions it would take to build a bridge from Russia to Crimea. Apparently, Putin plans to come in early and under budget.","If Mr. Putin's domestic popularity lags his expectations, he could always order convoys of partially empty white trucks to drive around Russia.","Agreed and Obama went a step further with diplomatic ignominy and alienation from Putin with his comment like a bored kid in the back of the classroom.

Yes, he might, but then hed only be violating another rule of geopolitics: The First Rule of Holes  when youre in one, stop digging...For some reason when I read The First Rule I thought about U.S. foreign policy during the last 15 years----throwing out, supporting throwing out, or seeking to throw out bad foreign leaders (Iraq,  Libya,  Syria) even when the no-goodniks are always replaced either by worse leaders or, worse, by anarchy.  ..President Obama's recent decision to normalize relations with Cuba just might be a signal that we are getting out of the business of seeking to topple foreign leaders or systems and moving towards diplomatic relations with all countries whether we approve of them or not.  Perhaps the acid test here will be Iran...As for Mr. Putin,  I think he is a creative opportunist of the first rank to have come as far as he has, and no doubt can change his approach to take advantage of new opportunities and overcome new dangers.   I think my former student,  Rep. Mike Rogers,  is right to say Putin is playing chess but wrong to dismiss President Obama as a marbles player.  ..Both leaders are chess players, but based on the results they have gotten and the difficulties each has worked under I would say Putin has been a somewhat better player so far.","Last week, Russias president, Vladimir V. Putin, said he could take Kiev in two weeks...I believe Putin made this comment in a context suggesting that he was explaining how  restrained he had been,  since taking Kiev would be so easy...Perhaps we and the Europeans hesitate to label this as an invasion (which it clearly is) for the same reason the U.S. government didn't want to call the overthrow of Morsi in Egypt a coup, since admitting such things without taking legally or (apparently) morally required responses would be awkward...When you look at how political boundaries have moved around during the last thousand years, the presumed stability implied by the post-World War II rules of the game appears hopelessly optimistic.

He correctly understands that the least bad outcome in Syria will be the prompt and total victory of the government forces there in the civil war.  He may now be presented with an opportunity to rectify Khrushchev's decision to hand Crimea with its Russian majority to Ukraine, when it didn't matter much because both were parts of the U.S.S.R.  It matters now.

Yes, he will fool some Americans some of the time. Putin does not need to invade his neighbors. He can give little Lithuania.

He is smart to pull back now before such a reality occurs in Moscow.",The Russians are now in open theft of their neighbor's territory.  Perhaps we should uphold our end of the Budapest Memorandum and give the Ukrainians a few nukes.  Then Putin can deal with a nuclear Ukraine with nothing to lose.  The Russians are being thugs.  The only thing they respect is force.  Let us in the West gird ourselves so that we can demonstrate the amount of force necessary to stop such blind and illegal acts of aggression as we see in Russians war on the Ukraine.,"Sadly this is the result of one thing, Russian desires to insert itself on its neighbors in what it deems is its sphere of influence.  The Russian, led by an emboldened Putin, have sought to prolong the fight in the Ukraine.  Putin himself told George W. Bush that the Ukraine doesn't really exist.  The weapons used are not something that anyone can just buy they were supplied by the Russians for the Rebels to use.  The Rebels in their zeal of shooting down another Ukrainian jet claimed responsibility for this tragedy.  It's time for the World to demand Russian stop support for such groups and to punish the Russians for this.","If you ask the leftist here the media is just as bad, as the media attacks the POTUS and Senators and gives Putin room in the opinion section to push his case.",,,,,,
BSR,,,,"As unpleasant as it is, this proposal is likely to be the best outcome for Ukraine unless the US and NATO are really willing to send weapons into Ukraine. Russia's actions are despicable but they do have national security interests in Ukraine and are not likely to back down without more of a fight.  Putin will continue the charade of sending in just enough Russian soldiersmaterial to support the separatist but still try to deny doing it. Unless we step in militarily he'll be able to hold off the Ukrainians for longer than the Ukrainian government will stay solvent. ..The bigger concern is whether Putin is simply lying again. Recall they have talked about cease-fires before. Unfortunately those conversations were all followed by escalating violence. We should push for a settlement while preparing for further sanctions and escalations. ..The old Russian proverb Reagan used to say is as fitting as ever.  Doveryai no proveryai (trust, but verify)","The reason further sanctions won't change the Russian tactics is that sanctions take years to be effective. Putin knows that he will be able to demand all sanctions be lifted in exchange for peace in Ukraine. ..The US should consider real sectoral sanctions with bite now, arming Ukraine, and building up real NATO positions in in the Baltics and Poland. If we and the Europeans don't want to do that then we owe it to the Ukrainians to let them know they need to stop fighting and negotiate the best deal they can.",The US and NATO should visibly build up NATO bases and missile defense in the Baltics and Poland. This can be used as a bargaining chip later if Putin becomes more reasonable or left in place to better defend NATO countries if Russia continues to act aggressively,"Why would Putin take this deal? Essentially the authors suggest Russia should leave Ukraine and accept that Ukraine will join the EU and NATO (in a few years) in exchange for sanction relief. This is the same deal we've been offering since the conflict started. Putin would be accepting defeat in order to have the sanctions lifted, but Putin doesn't really want the sanctions lifted...Russia's real problem is the drastic fall in the price of oil which will lead to a significant recession because Putin failed to diversify the Russian economy. Putin needs the sanctions so he can blame the pain of the recession on the west instead of his mismanagement of the economy and endemic corruption. ..Putin would be foolish to accept this deal (even if its the right thing to do). Instead, he will just freeze the conflict in place but act like he is trying to de-escalate it. That way there won't be any more sanctions. Then in March when the European sanctions expire he'll incrementally de-escalate enough so that EU will be divided and won't be able to maintain the sanctions. This way he can freeze the conflict which will prevent Ukraine joining the EU and NATO. Eventually Ukraine will go bankrupt and the west will get tired of giving billions of dollars to Ukraine in aid. Putin is gambling that Russians will support him long enough for Europe to lose interest.","This confrontation appears to be nearing its endgame. Russia has realized that continuing to support the insurgency indefinitely is no longer feasible. It has already pulled out the top commanders (Strelkov, Borodai, Bolotov) to avoid their punishment after the rebellion and to facilitate negotiations. Now the goal is to finally seek a negotiated settlement. A continued insurgency is critical for his ability to negotiate Russia's interests (No NATO in Ukraine, more power for pro-russian east)...The aid convoy is probably not a trojan horse in the classic sense of it being filled with guns and soldiers. Instead the goal is to maintain Putin's bargaining power in the upcoming negotiations next week. Ukraine is rapidly taking ground, albeit at high cost. Putin is using the humanitarian mission to force a ceasefire and resupply Luhansk in order to prevent the insurgency from being crushed. Ukraine of course did not want that so they were dragging their feet because blocking or attacking the caravan would be terrible PR. ..Hopefully we will see an end to this whole disaster soon.","There are a lot of comparisons made on these comments between the US and Russian systems. There are some grains of truth to the comparisons but the reality is worlds apart. If US citizens were motivated they could demand an end to money in politics. They don't because enough people are fooled by the Koch industry advertisements. In Russia, ending the kleptocracy would require a bloody revolution. Putin stops this by internet censoring, controlling all effective media, jailing political dissidents and protesters and vote rigging. ..Comparisons with Russia can be helpful to see the errors that we make here as well. Claiming equivalence does a major disservice to the civil institutions that make our country great: True democracy, freedom of speech and assembly, and an independent judiciary.",,,,

If putting U.S. military equipment and troops makes Putin think twice, then it is well worth it.","It is one more factor that must be considered.  If you American military equipment and the ability to get American troops into place quickly, it creates doubt for any sort of border-crossing shenanigans.  It adds unpredictability and shows that there is American resolve to defend these nations.  It makes it that much likely that Putin would try the same cute we are there but we are not there games that he is currently playing in Ukraine.",".  As someone who grew up in Poland, I know quite well the meaning of Russia and the sorts of atrocities that they are capable of.   The U.S. is certainly not perfect but they are even in the same ballpark as Russia.  When Russia came through in WW2, they wiped out a generation of Poles, all the top leaders, military, the best professors, politicians and more.  They deported many others and ruled the country with an iron fist, with utter brutality...  For some Americans, it might be shocking, but people in Poland, other than a small minority of hardcore Communists and Russian sympathizers, actually WANT American military in the country.  While people are complaining about U.S. military equipment possibly provoking Russia, Russia is holding troop exercises and movements right near the Polish border.   Russian subs and planes are routinely violating sovereign air and sea space of various nations.   ..  This isn't a case where the big bad American imperialist war machine is looking to throw their weight around.  The people of Poland, Estonia and other nations overwhelmingly support U.S. presence as a deterrent.  As is said, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.   This is the prevention, to hopefully help prevent a bigger war... For those who say negotiate with Russia, you are dreaming, not when fanatics and fascists like Alexander Duguin have Putin's ear. Vile rhetoric about reclaiming Soviet lands is the norm.   This is not the isolated rhetoric of nuts either.","So let him escalate.  He's already massed troops on the borders of Baltic nations.  All a move like this does is reaffirm the U.S.'s commitment to its NATO allies.   Now both sides have their cards on the table, as long as Putin thinks that the U.S. is willing to fight to protect those nations, he will never act and that is the entire point.  Russia is like that little kid that keeps pushing the envelope, seeing how much they can get away with.   You don't get them to behave better through appeasement, it only further emboldens them.","It is not about war, it is about peace.   Both sides are putting their cards on the table, both sides understand what the risks and potential consequences are, as long as both are playing the game, neither will act.   ..   What would embolden Putin is appeasement by the U.S., sitting back and doing absolutely nothing while he masses troops and tanks on the borders of these Baltic states.","The Baltic states are building up their militaries and generally meeting their NATO obligations, it is other members of NATO that are not pulling their weight, which is largely why these Baltic states lean so heavily on the U.S..     America is the only currency that matters, they are seen as the defender of freedom for these nations.   Nobody is looking for war, rather, it is to stand up to Putin and not allow him to keep pushing further.   As long as both sides think that the other is willing to act, nobody will.","Stop the military action and negotiate with Mr. Putin but keep HIS feet, and those of his financial backers, to the fire..   Replace Putin with Hitler and we might as well be back in the mid 30's.   Discussion with someone, who according to a close adviser views nations such as Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and others as strictly Russian property is useless...  Putin understand only the threat of force.   As long as the threat is real he will not act.",,,
Fritz,1,,,"Incredible article. Russian propaganda in German newspapers? What a nonsense, not to mention the description of the reality in her country. She confuses her wishes with reality which may fit typical US thinking. No matter what we do, what we believe, our faith, is all that matters. The reality in the Ukraine is much worse than the reality in Russia. Like it or not, if you know a little bit of Russian history, Putin is the most liberal law loving head of state Russia ever had. Face reality, read something on Russias history. Russian history starts with the need to have a safe road form the North to the Black Sea, this is where the Romanows started.",,,,,,,,,
David in Toledo,,,,"Yanukovych had pledged to the Ukrainian people to affiliate with the EU.  Who knew he would visit Putin and come back to break that pledge and instead try to push Ukraine into the Russian Economic Union?  Who knew tens and at times hundreds of thousands of his own people would publicly object?  (We couldn't have orchestrated that if we had tried.)  Who knew Yanukovych would make a regime change on himself by running to Russia, right after signing an agreement with his opposition to keep his job?..And now Mr. Putin wants to change the regime in Kyiv, without waiting for the May 25 election which will do just that.  Must not like elections.","1) Until Putin started slicing off pieces of Ukraine, Ukraine didn't need much of an army.  2) The Ukrainian army has been cautious about attacking fellow Ukrainians, however rebellious.  3) Some army members in a portion of the east have deserted or defected, just like Robert E. Lee, sometimes under pressure.  4)  Now the Ukrainian army has to go up against both the rebels and their well-supplied Russian sponsors from just across the border.","How do you think the USA came into being?..So you are now equating Strelkov, Borodai, Gubarev, Pushilin, and Putin to Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Franklin?  Have you read the biographies of these people?..Why not, for comparisons, use the revolutionaries Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, Nicola Jorgic, and Vujadin Popovic (Putin can be compared to himself)?","Why not this sequence?  Mr. Putin orders all Russians, volunteers or not, to leave Ukraine.  Mr. Putin withdraws troops from the Ukraine border and invites UN blue helmets to join his border patrol...THEN we talk about humanitarian aid to the formerly-seditionist communities which have lost their leaders and their supplies.","Every few months, we have a ceremony here in which new citizens take their oath.  They come from all over, and usually there is a Ukrainian or a Russian (or two) included...In addition to Edward Snowden, how many Americans are signing up as Russian citizens?..(And let's not consider the Ukrainians Putin is pulling into Greater Russia as willing immigrants, 97 votes or not.  Moving your boundary is not the same as welcoming someone to come across the boundary which the rest of the world, including your neighbor, accepts as your boundary.)","Russian troops captured inside Ukraine by accident, a passenger jet shot down not by us, and prisoners paraded down the street by the Donetsk Peoples Republic in violation of international law...The propaganda wars have just gotten even more challenging for Mr. Putin's apologists.","The more of Ukraine Putin might try to absorb, the more protestors and potential resistancesaboteurs he would be taking in...Not all of the eastern Ukrainians have seen Paree, but enough of them now know more of personal freedom than during the USSR, and are more loyal to Ukraine than to Russia.  They would be difficult to keep docile and obedient down on Putin's farm.","Reminds me of another cocky guy's Mission Accomplished moment...Turned out, while going laser-like after the terrorists would have been a good idea, that particular Mission was poorly conceived and executed.  I'm guessing and hoping that Putin will discover he's made similar mistakes.","Well, your post just got through.  Mistake 1.  The Russian-proxy pirates are being squeezed so that, without Putin's support, they will soon have to join Yanukovych back in Russia (2).  Putin's pirates had shot down 12 other planes already, which proves their motive to shoot at planes (3).  Of course they hit the wrong plane this time (oops on the tapes).  The airline chose its own route from among those that were open to international traffic and many other planes flew through the same area that day (4)...Were the pirates of the Donetsk Peoples Republic on a ship that had been fired on, and did they believe they were under attack from flight MH17?  Will they and Mr. Putin admit what they have done, and compensate the victims?  That is what happened in 1988 with Air 655...Spin as you will, conceal what evidence you can, the truth will out.","Judy, could you not write, Timothy, I know the US controls the Ukrainian government because. . . .  And My expertise in analysis of political puppetry is such-and-such . . .?  Just asserting that you somehow magically know more than the rest of us is unconvincing...We know Yanukovych was and is Putin's puppet because he abdicated to Putinland.  Barack Obama's only interest in Ukraine is preserving, as much as possible, the rule of international law -- that sovereign states not be sliced up by their neighbors and pirates are brought to account...We have all seen the international observers speaking for themselves and complaining that the pirates have limited their time and movements on site, while drinking and firing their guns in the air (not at any federal attackers)."
andy,,,,"I hope Pres. Obama doesn't listen to the hawks in Congress. The USA must stay out of this conflict! Sending weapons to Ukraine would be tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia, and Putin today is like a cornered tiger - his economy crumbling under the weight of sanctions and cheap oil; his consensus eroding at home - he has nothing to lose...By giving any sort of military support we would get entangled into a murky situation and we would throw Europe into turmoil, as Putin would waste no time in pointing at NATO as the new enemy. He would use this excuse to move against Poland and the Baltic States. It would be WWIII for Europe. We don't need that. Ignore Congress. Veto any action. This is not our war.",This comment might have been written by Putin's press office...I am astonished to read so many comments justifying Putin and his actions! Is this the NYT or Pravda (circa 1987?),"I wonder what all those Republican senators have to say today about the great leader in the Kremlin that they praised for his strong decision making...Russia is a rogue state, in the hands of a rogue dictator who is not so much of a great strategist after all. The same country yokels that were given these deadly weapons to play with could have just as easily have shot down a Russian Aeroflot airliner - and now what would Putin have to say about that?","Right. One crucial point: Putin's base are profiteers from petrodollars who are used to spend them in NATO zone. Many sit in parliament that voted for aggression in Ukraine. Deny them visas, and they will miss their villas and yachts in Mediterranean and Miami already this summer, much early then any cost to Europe! You'll see the effect very soon.","The US and UK along with EU must put Putin's oligarchs already identified and Parliament members  top government officials before the personal choice between.the West where there families, fortunes and vacations are and neo-soviet nationalistic regime in Russia..   Before it is too late for them and all of us! A nuclear armed aggressor of national-socialist type in Europe will cost London and Paris dearly..   So the only way is individual sanctions on much larger scale including proxies and NOW!",,,,,
Tom Cuddy,,,,"When the Soviet Union imploded and Western Hawks started being anti-Russian instead of anti -Soviet I wondered if the whole anti Communist thing wasn't a ploy to be anti Russian. Seriously the degree that anti Soviet ideology became anti Russian was amazing. USA triumphalism, saying we 'won' the Cold War instead of humanity winning the Cold War was particularly grating. We expanded NATO after assuring Gorbachev that we would not, So Putin sees excessive US power as a big deal? Wonder why?",Are you sure the people that overthrew a democratically elected government months before scheduled elections are the true voice of the Ukrainian people? Just because Putin is bad does not make the Maidan people any less Right leaning as far as its leaders go.,Putin or W? It is a toss up as to who iswas more reckless. Our Monroe Doctrine and the Russian 'Near Abroad' are really pretty similar. To me the criticism of Russia's foreign policy sounds like the USA demanding one set of rules for itself and one for everyone else. I am deeply suspicious of the  Kiev government as I also am of Putin,"I  am so suspicious of Kiev being a  wind up being anti  Moscow puppet but it that a bad idea? I do think ISIL gives Putin as great chance to show he is protecting Christian society.  If you want to re -instate Christendom I think fighting Islamic extremism is more important than hating gays. I do not trust the Kiev govt at all, but iut is obvious Putin is not the trustable type either.","Isn't Russia intrinsically an empire? What is Russia proper? The ancient Kingdom of Rus with Kiev as a capitol? ( not popular I imagine). At the time Bush II was proclaiming his imperial pre-emptive war ideology we said other countries will notice. Putin knew to call Chechyna Islamic terrorists The US can never agin pose as a semi moral power, which is an oxymoron butan oxymoron we gave face value too between WWII an d 9-11.

The sanctions imposed on Russia are something Putin can laugh about.",,,,,,,
M. Imberti,,,,"'Why should the US feel obliged to solve their (the EU) problems?..What problems?  The EU doesn't have any problems with Russia.  Unless you mean those countries formerly part of the old Soviet Union, which should never have been admitted into the European Union in the first place, as their peoples are mostly Slavic and have more in common with Russian heritage and culture than they do with their European counterpart..The whole point of making them 'part of Europe' of course was to put NATO conveniently at Russia's doorstep, and coming to their 'defense' is an excellent excuse for the US to surround Russia with military power. One can only hope Putin sees this as the display of bravadoccio it is and not as a serious threat.","A little publicized fact is that the Russian ambassador at the UN presented a plan to resolve the Syrian conflict in February of 2012, by offering to conduct negotiations between Assad and his opposition, with Assad eventually making a dignified, face-saving exit..The Western powers saw no need to make a deal, believing Assad was on the verge of defeat, and turned down the offer..The result:  3 and 12 (and counting) more years of bloody civil war, hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced, and a refugee crisis threatening to destroy Europe.  And they are still debating whether to accept Putin's help?","Some other commenter has already pointed out that those WMDs were Soviet, left in Ukraine after the collapse of the USSR, did not rightfully belong to Ukraine and therefore were not theirs to keep or give up - they HAD to be removed to avoid the possibility of their falling into the wrong hands..As for the protection guarantee,  it works both ways:  since Ukraine has been plunged into civil war due to the violent actions of some anti-government faction (egged on by the West), including the illegal removal of the elected president, Putin is observing the spirit of the agreement by intervening to protect the pro-Russia population..The lesson:  if you claim to be a democracy, you should start acting like one.",Thank you for the excellent comment and the link to an article that should be mandatory reading for all the Putin's bashers out there.,"I was about to put in my own two cents, but in reading the first dozen or so of the Readers' picks I see that my opinion has already been expressed  by others (special nod to Mark Thomason)...Just this:  my suggestion for a subtitle to the article would be What is the US' aim in supporting an insurgency in Ukraine? - other than reducing Putin's sphere of influence in the European continent and perhaps introducing a little of our own.  Never mind what the majority of the Ukrainian people prefer.  We can't ignore another opportunity to spread Western-style democracy - after all, it worked so well in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, hopefully Syria.... ..Another question is why would the European Union even consider including Ukraine as a member?   To add another bankrupt country - another Greece - to their current problems?  But I bet Ms. Merkel has her reasons - just ask President Obama.",,,,,
Richard Navas,,,,Putin needs a surgical procedure to re-connect the two sides of his mouth.,But why would he want to stop this war?  This war is exactly what he intended. This is the plan.  (Actually he would refer that Ukraine simply submit)   The motive force that compels him to secure Ukraine for Russia is far stronger than any sanctions we have levied.   Vladimir Putin not halt this project until the cost is vastly higher.,"Mr. Obama, it is time to ramp up the voltage on Putin far beyond anything tried so far.  The Russians will keep on pushing and pushing and pushing until they feel far more hurt than they have.  If not now, we will be forced to do much more in the months ahead.","The Cool One--Barack Obama--is exactly the man the US needed in confronting Mr Putin.  Since the beginning of the Ukraine crisis the challenge has been finding the correct voltage necessary to message the Russia leadership that their Ukraine plan won't work.  A few sanctions and an increased military presence in the region (which included closer monitoring of the airspace) caused Putin to change tactics from the 'grab it, it's yours' operation in Crimea to the low level conflict we've seen in E.Ukraine.  This delayed Vladimir's schedule, but did't stop him.  So Mr. Obama has regularly notched upped the voltage and worked in the background with European allies to prepare further steps.  There was no need to Big-Talk Gun waving bluster.",,,,,,
C.O.,,,,"The onesidedness of this Editorial is really a sad phenomenon because it is one further proof of the dominant anti-Russian ideology of the West and of the complete lack of American selfcriticism. As to the geopolitical competition between East and West and the rather vigorous role the US is playing in it I can only recommend reading John Mearsheimer's essay on the Ukraine crisis. You indict Russias 2014 annexation of Crimea and Russia's backing of separatists in the Ukraine without putting these events into perspective. The Crimea is not only a historical center of Russian identity but has a largely Russian population. Whether we have here an annexion or rather a secession is in serious disagreement between international lawyers. And that Russia is supporting Russian separatists in the Ukraine is to some extent understandable and pales in comparison to the multiple backings of rebels by the US worldwide. In my opinion the US should propagate a Swiss model for the Ukraine, a federalisation of the state, and should stop the economic warfare that is bad for all sides. Putin suggested a trilateral economic treaty between Europe, Ukraine and Russia in place of the exclusive EU- Ukraine treaty at the expense of Russia. But this was rejected. Not a wise decision.","According to my information  the demontrators did not ask Putin to send troops to the region as a peacekeeping force but rather to help them in case the Kiew  government opted for military action. In addition, talking of the new Ukrainian government, and warning Russia not to undermine it, seems somewhat odd since the new government came into power through a coup. But these points aside, I think that nothing should be easier for Kerry and Lavrov to meet and organize the elections in Ukraine for March, including the possibility in various regions to hold a referendum whether to  stay in Ukraine or join Russia. That should be democracy at work.","Comparisons between Putin and Hitler, also made by Hillary Clinton, leave something to be desired. When Hitler annexed the German Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he did so with the consent of France and England who pressured Benes to give it away, possibly reminiscent of US President Wilson's point after World War I that borders should reflect the ethnic makeup of a population. Hitler became the criminal that he was when he invaded Prague, attacked Poland and unleashed his murderous war against Russia. I don't think that such a criminal megalomenia is on Putins mind.","It is incomprehensible to me that the West is calling on Russia to use its influence on the separatists but at the same time is not calling on Kiew to stop its military actions against the eastern Ukraine. I think this must be part of a deal for a peaceful solution. Unfortunately the same double standard is evident elsewhere on this globe. Obama's call on Putin in respect to the Ukraine could easily be rephrased like this for Syria: the West should stop the flow of fighters and arms across the Syrian border and convince them to end their violence, lay down their weapons and enter into a dialogue with Assad. This may sound provocative but it is about time that the West and Russia cooperate in a more reasonable way to end their proxywars.","The comparison between Hitler's anexation of the German part of Sudeten Germans in 1938 and Putin's anexation of Crimea is often completely misunderstood, even by Hillary Clinton who made the comparison recently. You have to look back at US President Wison's impressive 14 points for an international peace treaty in 1918 whose main points dealt with the sovereignty of free nations and their territorial integrity. Part of the territorial integrity consisted of the identity of borders and population. Contrary to this concept the German Sudetenland for various reasons became part of Czechoslovakia after 1918 and stayed a hot spot until 1938 when Sudeten Germans voted for reunification with Germany. It was actually France, Great Britain and Italy who pressured Benes, the President of Czechoslovakia, to let the Sudetenland go. The criminal activities of Hitler, all well known, were manifest in other fields.",,,,,
anthony weishar,,,,"Putin is like a cat playing with a captured mouse. The west is too dumb to know it, thus the confusion about his actions. He's KGB, so he's far beyond the other world leaders in the chess game of world politics. The troop movement is a great example. The US and other say they appear to be in the same place, unmoved. This tells Putin who is watching and what they can see. He may have moved them and left the appearances of entrenched troops. One of Russia's main military tech programs designs with stealth in a variety of media.","This opinion and many of the news stories about this conflict totally miss a critical element, oil. Much like the US invasion of the Middle East, Russia has interests to protect in Ukraine, the pipelines that send Russian oil to Europe. There is no way of knowing what the new Ukrainian government might do to these supply lines. Putin holds the trump card here. He can create chaos in Europe by turning off the oil. He also has a military force that has not been decimated by ten years of ground wars. The US has a million Iraq-Afghanistan veterans on disability and a trillion dollars worth of equipment in disrepair or clogged with sand.","This has been a long time coming. America's use of war and military action to solve disputes in other countries created the image of a global bully. We should have picked up some sense of our negative image when we had to start telling people in Europe that we we Canadians. Putin uses restraint where the U.S. would have used fighter jets, missiles, and drones. He comes of as less bellicose and more of a negotiator. Of course the U.S. hasn't set the bar too high over the last few decades.","Now we're getting to the core of the problem, natural gas and oil. Russia is the world's number 1 supplier of natural gas and number 2 for oil. Much of it runs through Ukraine. Putin is chuckling because he's doing the same thing the U.S. did in the Middle East, protect the oil and gas supply. Most of Europe's natural gas and oil comes from Russia. If China, who is backing Putin, and Russia drop the petrodollar and the US debt they own, the US economy will be in chaos. We need to tread lighly here.",,,,,,
Felman,,,,"Probably as serious as claims that any other country can not control nuts who fight in Syria against Assad or American soldiers of fortune fighting in each and every  war or military conflict around the world. You are clearly do not want to see the forest beyond the trees - thanks for a one-sided coverage of the conflict from a day one, here, in US. Eastern Ukraine is populated by ethnics Russians, who are citizens of Ukraine. Absolute majority of the rebels - you would call them freedom-fighter, if they would be in Syria - are ethnics Russians, who are citizens of Ukraine..What Ukrainian army does in the moment, is killing its own citizens - and US not just applauds, but encourage the killings. As any ugly war agents its citizens - take Assad example - the war brings thugs like ISIS or like Strelkov or Sasko Bely. I do not care about these thugs - kill them all. But seeing hundreds children and women killed by by Ukrainian army artillery and bombs breaks my heart. You may not care because they are ethnically Russians or at least have some Russian blood in them - but I do. Hanging this was on Putin is just stupid - it is real problem in Ukraine which Kiev want to solve by ethnic cleansing - with Europe smiling on it.","I hate Putin for what he does in Russia, which is unfortunately willingly supported by the Russian electorate. And I know this firsthand But when you compare Russia's foreign policy with that of US and NATO in last 20 years or so, it makes much more sense than desire of the colde-war winning party to impose its will on the rest of the world..Nothing can be compared with disastrous results of Bush'sChaney'sBlare's unjustified invasion and destruction of Iraq, followed by similar invasion and destruction of Libya by NATO. Now West (and Saudis!) trying to do the same in Syria - with even more casualties and probably even more disastrous results. This article is focusing in a mediocre KGB officer and is trying to assign him a fear of public disorder. In modern Russia - you have to travel there to understand this - Putin is so popular that he has to fear nothing. While my favorite Russian party, The Union of Right Forces, is so unpopular that it cannot get 5 of votes in general elections to get representation in Russian Parliament. Meanwhile, the dominant party, United Russia, ses the Fox news (Rupert Murdock) style propaganda and US Republican Party methods and principles (powermoneyfull control) to stay firmly in control. I would love to see Russia progressing towards democracy, but I do not share the Wets desire to destroy it and to put it on its knees - the policy that USA and NATO are pursuing from the day when Russian Federation was liberated from Soviet Union.","And what are your numbers. I'd been in Russia last year and I clearly seen emergence - not as tong as want - but still a very strong emergence of middle class. I do not like Putin's politics, but it is a fact that Russian economy developed very well during his presidency.  Admitting this fact does not change that Putin is pushing Russia backwards, but it explains a lot of his popularity.","While I hate Putin and United Russia pushing Russian democracy backwards, your observation of the democratic institutions in Ukraine are completely off. If you could read - as I could -Ukrainian Soviet-Era-style propaganda or simply watch debates in Ukrainian Rada (parliament) , you would be strongly disappointed by the state of democracy in Ukraine. Sorry, but Ukraine suffered from switching from corrupted pro-Russia to corrupt pro-EU government, went through two revolutions in last few years. But I hope by finishing the war against its own citizens and focusing on rebuilding the country economy, Ukraine will became a flourishing democracy - this will be the best response to Putin.",,,,,,

Many countries bordering Russia are worried about its aggressive actions, past, present and future. And despite all the hue and cry about the villainous NATO, that defense pact never had anywhere near an offensive capacity to match that of the Warsaw Pact! Russia, like Israel, is using the crimes of the past to justify a super aggressive stance towards its neighbors. My heart is with the Ukrainian government and people, but I think Obama is correct to work hard for a negotiated settlement while building up NATO's support for the Baltic countries.

NI,,,,"Putin was always a wily fox or should I say a wolf. The wolf wore a lamb's clothing for sometime but I guess the suit got  too hot. So he stepped out in his own skin. Crimea is annexed with hardly a whimper from us or Western Europe. Ditto, western Ukraine but that was not annexation, just Russian presence ( just a matter of semantics but won the stand-off ). Sanctions applied, achieved with great coercion of Western Europe. Now Angela Merkel is doing the heavy lifting. Meanwhile we are undoing what was put in place to clip Putin's wings.  Our Secretary of State pays homage in Sochi. We find we have to have Russian engines for our rocket launchers. We need their space-craft to ferry our astronauts to the space-station. We have become the super-power with wobbly knees. No wonder Putin smugly pursues his dream of becoming the Soviet Union.We will be seeing him strutting his chest and horse-back riding near his datcha, of course, shirtless.","Putin has always been wily. He knows when he comes to the UN he will be taken to task about Crimea and Ukraine. So he makes a deft move for a different solution to the Syrian crisis. He is killing many birds with one stone - focus the light away from Crimea, a likely solution to the murder and mayhem in Syria, rein in the ISIS, justify support to  Assad, be the Leader to initiate a possible workable solution to beat the ISIS and above all steal the thunder from right under our noses. Sounds like a great plan - for him and Russia !!!","It is way past time we got the countries right, our priorities straight We went to war with the wrong country, gave the wrong country a favored nation status ( China ), picked up battles in places where we are not welcomed, championing and committing human rights when it suits us. We have wrong friends and allies who belittle us at every juncture and we turn a blind eye to their atrocities. So let's change course ( better late than never ). Let us get out of the Pandora's Box which is the ME as we cannot distinguish between friend or foe. Iran should be way down the priority list as their nuclear capability will be of no consequence to us. Remove sanctions so that they can join the ME conundrum and bring some control and sanity. They will do the job better because it is in their backyard. Israel can very well take care of itself. Their powerful army has shown it's superiority even minus the nukes. Let's get out of Trade Pacts killing our jobs. China should be off the favored nation list - for encroachment of islands off the Pacific Coast, Human Rights and Labor Laws violations. And the most important - we should really focus on - Russia. We (along with our NATO allies ) impose strangulating sanctions and a strong military buildup on the eastern border with Russia. That will deter Putin from his grandiose expansionist plans and he is smart enough not to play his nuke card. China, the opportunist fence-sitter will also skulk away. Meanwhile we beef up our own borders.",Now this would be a real solution  to Russia's intentions or rather all the Russian troops and artillery already in East Ukraine. Macho Putin would'nt be foolish enough to advance and annex parts of Ukraine under the Pro-Russian militias. But the Western Europe Has to bear the burden more if not equally. This would give us more for the buck. And get the hell out of the ME where we are babes in the woods.,"All the dealing and wheeling in Minsk, was for nought. There was not even ONE day of ceasefire. All the time,diplomacy and money went down the drain. There was not even a pretense of a ceasefire. Europe thought diplomacy would work but everything went Putin's way. He will not rest until he annexes Eastern Ukraine or perhaps the whole of Ukraine. When he lands up on the border of Western Europe will they realize their folly. Hopefully, we will not get involved. Let the Europeans put up a fight. The whole world thinks we have to do their dirty jobs. Sorry! Rich Europe must defend itself. We'll do our bit to help them - TIGHTEN SANCTIONS until Putin is gasping for air.","Great! Now we should step back and let Russia take on the onus. And since Assad is their pal, they can offer a safe passage into Russia for Assad and his family with perhaps a dacha overlooking the Black Sea. Putin's move is a blessing in disguise. Let's not squander it away, egotistical that we are!","And have we added Russia to the  State sponsored Terror List. They most certainly belong in the list compared to Cuba, Iran,Syria and Sudan. Putin, being cornered, has become an extremely dangerous animal. And he has nuclear arsenal to boot. And to think, Lavrov, their foreign minister wanted to transfer all nuclear material from Iran to their country. Laughable, if it was not such a serious existential threat. Iran looks like a lamb to Russia's wolf. And while all our efforts will be spent to declaw Iran who has shown extreme restraint, Russia will use this opportunity to wreak havoc in Europe, NATO or no NATO. The advantage is always in the element of surprise and Europe will be left gasping on their wrong foot. And the vulture that he is, he has given Iran an offer which they cannot refuse especially when we are trying to extract a pound of flesh from them and pushing them to the brink and interfering in their own national affairs. And that is exactly what will happen, if we let our Foreign Policy be Israel-centric and our un-patriotic Congress who cannot see beyond their noses, undoing Executive Powers which countries like other negotiating parties Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China will never do. This Congress is undermining our own credibility and our super-power status, beholden to a few well-healed lobbies. Putin may bring about his own demise but not before he condemns others to the same fate.","This is what happens with a nebulous, ambiguous cease-fire - NO CEASE-FIRE..All that shuttle diplomacy resulted in nought. The wily fox Putin won. Hopefully this victory is short lived. The clock is ticking for Europe. Have they not understood the very obvious Putin's master plan? Or are they waiting for us to do their dirty work? Hopefully, we have the smarts not to get embroiled. The Europeans have skin in the game. So let them  do the fighting as they have everything to lose.We will help them - WITH SANCTIONS.","Great! Now we should step back and let Russia take on the onus. And since Assad is their pal, they can offer a safe passage into Russia for Assad and his family with perhaps a dacha overlooking the Black Sea. Putin's move is a blessing in disguise. Let's not squander it away, egotistical that we are!","Why are Western Leaders trying to appease Putin? Ukraine is a sovereign country, remember? Putin should'nt even be in the picture. If he is supporting the rebels with artillery, that maybe understandable ( not really! ) but to send Russian troops to Ukraine is declaration of war. The Western powers should help Kiev with all artillery at their disposal. Also, they should tighten the noose around Putin until he is gasping for air with total sanctions. Show him no mercy. We will see him buckling down very fast. Yes, the Russians are going to be really hurt. But then, they have the responsibility to overthrow this Despot. If you can do that to Cuba (which was really no threat except in the distant, distant past) Russia should be dealt with in the same manner because there is a clear and present danger."
V,,,,"We also know how to dish out the pain, and Putin is on his way out...I seriously have no idea how you've got the notion that Russians like to see themselves as victims. We don't. Perhaps if you listened less to narratives peddled by pro-Kremlin trolls and paid more attention to what independent Russian media and bloggers have to say, you'd have a different picture of us...Same with the often-cited and highly dubious figure of Putin's approval rating, that comes from VTSIOM, a polling agency controlled by Russian authorities. If Putin really had his 84 share of supporters, he'd have no reason to clamp down on opposition rallies and unlawfully persecute his opponents.","Quote for the record:.Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the major geopolitical disaster of the century.  As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama.  Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself..Vladimir Putin",,,,,,,,
sammy zoso,,,,Looks like the economic sanctions against Putin and his cabal are working very well so far - as in silly and stupid. When is the U.S. and Europe going to get serous about helping Ukraine? So let's get tough already and make sure the crime scene is well guarded with some military personnel. And then leave some behind to take care of this disgusting rag tag group of rebels cause so much despair. This has gone on long enough.,Putin would be smart to watch his step. The people of Russia will decide when they've had enough of his tyranny.,,,,,,,,
coale johnson,,,,i keep trying to avoid this comparison.... since it seems so obvious it must be naive? non-intellectual? the problem is that what i see and hear from putin seems to show a small man with BIG ideas and an over healthy sense of self worth. if we allowed him ukraine would he be satisfied or encouraged? i hope our silent president is getting some big ideas of his own on how to stop this without a military showdown.,"pointing out obama's many and varied flaws does not make putin look any better to me and it certainly does not change the actions he takes and continues to take against ukraine. this seven steps to heaven he proposes, just before nato meets is just a ply, an obvious ploy. he could have proposed this at any time. why now? i think you know.",i take issue with the title of this article...... militants? well i guess so but as much as they may be militant they are paid mercenaries in the service of putin. i think the destabilization of ukraine began with the looting of the country by putin's ousted puppet. how perfect to let an irate populace create the vacuum he needed to invade.,Victory is more important to them than than human life...maybe when we realize that this is how wars are fought we will be less eager to start them. i am betting that putin is as  surprised as anyone that they shot down a commercial airliner..... but then he is the one who opened pandora's box.,i never thought i would see another viet nam and then along comes GW and he starts TWO of them. now it looks like i just might see WWIII..the sanctions seem to be the best choice but i wonder if there is a plan for the moment when putin takes off his shirt and rides his charger into ukraine?,what we need to counter putin is slim pickens.,,,,

HJAC,,,,"What poppycock Mark!  You seem to have it all worked out and that Putin can do what he wants regardless.  It is simple really, elementary my dear Watson.  Your armchair account does not deal adequately with the unforeseeable and the unpredictable in your calculations.  The what if scenarios are absent here, not to mention the terms, possible future repercussions, weaknesses, strains and actions that occur to affect outcomes and change them. You seem to have it too nicely packaged.  Do events always go to plan?  Is the West as naive as you imply?  Does Russian really have all the aces?  Is it the Russians and the risible separatists who are panicking rather than the West?  Who knows how the Russians, the Kremlin separatists, the Ukraine and the West will further respond when much is still fluid and in flux that resolution and agreement, if it comes, may be years in the making.   Perhaps the Ukrainians are tougher than you think.   It is even possible that there are much more unthought-of actions to come from the West.  After all, Russia only has two options: invade or continue to support insurrection.","How much more of this carnage can the Ukrainian people bear?  At what point will the country just crumble?   Economic sanctions and diplomacy to holdback and resolve this invasion have failed but I applaud the efforts that have been made. The Russians have developed a simply-minded kind of philosophy that involves the use of force not as a last resort but as a first option.  Surrender and give us what we want or we will take it anyway with all guns blazing indiscriminately of anything that stands in our way.  The prodigal son has arrived, all hale mother Russia.  This sounds vaguely familiar.  Putin believes might is right.  Another part of the simply-mined political philosophy of Russian thinking.  Machiavelli, Genghis Khan and the Viking Blood Axe are compulsory reading for the oligarchical Russian political and military classes.  Faced by such forces Ukraine has ordered conscription. They are going to have to defend their country by laying down their lives for freedom.  At last, NATO's Secretary General Anders Rasmussen has today openly stated at the UN that Ukraine should consider joining NATO.   This is a significant shift in strategy, lets us hope it makes a difference.","Who is the aggressor here?.Does a country have a right to self-determined?. Is a country justified in wanting to defend its territorial boarder when invasion appears imminent?.(1) A US journalist is beaten, blindfolded and told he might be killed.(2) International observers are arrested as spies.(3)  A recent peace agreement has been broken by Russia.(4) Russia military aircraft have violated Ukraine's airspace.(5) Russian has its army on the boarder of Ukraine and combat ready to go in any time.(6) Russian takes Crimea from Ukraine.(7) Ukraine's parliament removed the previous president on corruption charges.(8) Ukraine approached European and US for assistance to rebuild its economy and democracy.(9) European nations have had their airspace and territorial waters tested by Russian air force and navy..(10) Europe and the US have imposed sanctions against Russia with the US taking the lead..(11) Putin tells the world he has a right to invade Ukraine should he feel the necessity to do so.(12) Pro-Russian protesters seize TV and radio stations.(13) The mayor of Kharkin was been shot and is in a critical condition..(14) Pro-Russian sympathisers are continuing to destabilise Ukraine.I could go on..In this conflict, these are some of the current facts as our free press has reported them.  No amount of selective and simplistic historical facts of past events will do because what truly matters for now is what is actually occurring as events unfold.","Putin is a bombast!  There is no end to his mendacity.  1010 I would give him for being treacherous.  These elections were designed to cause further mayhem. We have heard the Kremlin separatists mention how they would like to march to Berlin and Brussels and just the other day, true to form, the Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted that he would like to bomb Romania.  Sick jokes clearly seem to embolden them.  Putin has ordered his accolades to plunder and pillage Ukraine, the idea being that havoc and destruction will eventually make the Ukrainians anxious enough to realise the error of their ways and compel them once again to become united with Mother Russia, fearing Putin the merciful.  The West is dealing with a regime that appears rotten to the core.  Certainly Russias Achilles heel is their state energy giant GAZPROM.  Europes Achilles heel which Putin has correctly judged is how reasonable and friendly they are.  Rasputin has done his homework.  Nothing good has yet to come out of this conflict.  Impressed by the results of this election and the Kremlin will have struck another nail in the coffin of Ukraine.  If the people of Ukraine what to be part of Russia that is their choice but this mad hatters tea party of an election can only further fuel distrust.","For many different reasons, military intervention by the West should not be an option.  If Putin wants to take Ukraine, then, self-evidently, he can.  By now the West, if it is serious should know how to play an opponent like Putin.   We all know what he is doing and what he wants.  He is high on testosterone and daily steroid injections.  Megalomaniacal, brutal, charismatic and adorable; from Russia with love!","With impunity the Russian's feel they can strike at will. Their philosophy, way of life and diplomacy is centred on the concept that might is right.  Russia is clearly a country pathologically struggling to get out of the 18th century in so many different ways.  It is in excusable that the Russians will not allow Ukraine to decided its own destiny. In its anger, Putin like Nero is determined to set it on fire.  The West has its problems too but compared to the Russians our view of freedom and democracy gets lost in translation.  Our world has much still to learn. Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe, H. G. Wells.",,,,
Cornflower Rhys,,,,"But would supplying them with arms protect a sovereign nation's right not to be invaded?  I don't think so.  If the West, i.e. NATO, is not going to go in and make Putin stop, then they are wasting lives and treasure.  It won't work, that's the worst criticism one can make of the move.  Sure, right is on our side, but so what?","I am no fan of Vladimir Putin, but let's face it -- he may be right.  The West has fomented insurgency in the Middle East that has been nothing but a failure.  Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Yemen.  The fact is that the West has no answer to the question, after Assad, what?  This is in part because the answer involves occupation and engagement to build the government that would come next for decades and the West, esp. the US does not want to do that.  So having no answer to that question, perhaps Putin is right - Assad is better than the available alternatives.","Putin can't do anything he wants.  Putin does exactly what he knows he can without risking outright war with the west.  E.g. the Ukraine, not a NATO member nation, and Syria, which the west has clearly shown for several years now that it will not fight to defend.",Putin is a little boy on the playground kicking dirt at the knees of the big guys.,,,,,,

If the petrodollar dies, so does the racket called US economy in conjunction with the IMF and the Fed, which could easily set us back to the early Middle Ages with a barter economy. Russia poses the greatest threat in that direction, so US foreign policy is geared towards at least slowing down the process. Destabilization of Ukraine is in its best interest, while Putin's Russia would benefit more from a less corrupt Ukraine; something Ukrainians have painfully failed to achieve in the last 20 years... The motors or US economy, Wall Street and the Fed, must keep flying, or we will not have any economy left. (The vast majority of citizens are already approaching 3rd-world living standards.) As it has been proven several times before, the US economy needs armed conflicts simply in order to survive. However, this time, it has bitten off a larger chunk than it can swallow. Provoking Putin into making an economic alliance with China proved how ill-advised current US foreign policy is, but it seems to be getting worse...Who are our allies?","Putin may have thought about this too. As long as Russian assets are in petrodollars, he can lose. Maybe wants to end that era. The US is making the same mistake now as the Soviet Union did when it put on the gloves for the arms race in the Reagen era. Out butts are sticking out of our pants, but we keep spending the money we don't have.",,,,,,,,

Also the regional economic and political interactions among the former Soviet republics did not entirely vanish.   Secondly you claim human energy was released as the yoke of communist tyranny was lifted.    In actuality it wasn't so much human energy as man's instinctive worst traits that were unleashed..This is proved by how mafia-like almost criminal forces began taking over in the former U.S.S.R. as soon as any 'yoke' was lifted...So contrary to any such claims, there was no great improvement, and the very fact that Russia today is over-reliant on its resources, its commodities, just proves how badly any 'human energies' actually were released.  In fact, this sounds like some kind of propaganda for Western-type 'freedoms', this idea of people getting this energy, propaganda for the very kind of human freedom which has resulted in the capitalism running amok in the West..So the very arguments you are trying to use against Putin's legacy, really backfire and prove how wrong they are.

It would be unfair to give Ukrainians a false sense of security by suggesting otherwise..What the US, and more so the thus-far more reluctant western Europe states, can do is to ensure that the Putin regime pays an ever higher price -in terms of economic, political, and cultural sanctions- for continuing to violate Ukraine's sovereignty and to wreak violence upon the country..And the western allies can strengthen the defenses of those countries which are full NATO members, so that the Russian oligarchs are less tempted to continue trying foreign mischief-making as a ruse to hide the incompetence of their domestic policies, by expanding their aggression beyond Ukraine to other ex-Soviet bloc countries...If Putin wants another Cold War, the West can fight another one and win a second time (if it remembers what worked and did not work the first time).","The deceptive propaganda of Putin and his henchmen richly deserves a forthright and direct rebuttal from the West.

He will stop at nothing.",But the real question is whom does Nickolai respect more: Putin or Obama?,Never. The Ukrainian parliament is dominated by pro Putin sympathizers.,"Please get it right. History can't be rewritten. Russia derived from Ukraine, from the Kyivan Rus. The first Russian leader was the progeny, a prince (Yaroslav), of the king of Ukraine. He Christianized the Russian empire as part of Ukraine and his sons carried on the legacy until those lands were invaded around the 12th or 13th century. ..And let's not get another thing wrong: Putin is on a mission. You are correct, Porter, about Ukraine's land invasion by Putin. But it's today, Ukraine. Tomorrow, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Poland and Czechoslovakia, the day after.

His propaganda machine runs 247 and now this delusional oligarch whips out the threat of nuclear weapons if the west intrudes. And he hates, absolutely loathes, Barack Obama.

Stalin reseeded the region with Russians, predominantly in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's northern neighbors have done a great job at decimating the native population over the last 100 years, starting with what Ukrainians know as Catherine the Bloody. Stalin was bent on eradicating a people and nation he couldn't stand; and, if he couldn't completely kill them, he would try to exterminate their identity, their language and their religions by homogenizing them with Russia. Well it didn't work. Many fled and maintain their sense of ethnic identity abroad. And many have returned to a struggling democracy. There's a reason why Ukraine's national anthem is Ukraine Has Not Yet Perished. Putin would love to finish off the job once and for all. He is no better than Hitler. Have we forgotten those horrors in our generation?","Unfrotuantely, Putin's actions now are reminiscent of Stalin's many decades ago.

It already started: Putin has been planning this for years.","One thing here is disturbing me. Unless I've missed it, I haven't seen media reports on what is going on in Moscow now. Friends there are reporting vociferous protests against Vladimir Putin. There are calling for his overthrow and condemning his invasion of Ukraine. They are demanding the withdrawal of Russian military forces. Russian intellectuals, in particular, have been quite vocal in their opposition to the invasion of Crimea and threatened penetration of Ukraine's mainland. These reports are showing up online on Ukrainian Pravda. ..If Russians are appalled by Putin's actions, he has no popular political support for his unlawful actions. ..And yes indeed, this is our business. If Ukraine falls, western Europe and bordering Asian nations will be next. Make no mistake about Putin's Stalinist ambitions.","Absolutely wrong. Being intimately familiar with Ukraine, I can assure you that if Ukraine falls -- yet again -- to Russia, there is going to be a huge loss and Putin will fill the power vacuum created. Why do you think that Merkel is legitimately ratcheting up the war rhetoric? Ukraine represents the west's gateway to Asia and Asia's to the rest of Europe. Despite an impoverished economy and weak infrastructure, Ukraine abounds in natural resources. It was a world leader among nuclear powers until that mid-'90's treaty executed by GW and Putin, but there is much to be saved. A fortune is at stake here. There's a reason Russia is salivating over Ukraine and Putin is willing to test his country's economic mettle against the West.  Think about it. We don't live on an island unto ourselves.

Consider that when Ukraine started using airstrikes against the rebels, suddenly anti-aircraft weapons appeared.  Consider that it was not long ago that Ukrainian forces had Donetsk (or was it Luhansk) surrounded.  The NovoazorskMariupol gambit is an attempt to open a front in the Ukrainian rear to break that siege.  And now the tables have been turned on the Ukrainians.  Here Putin's obvious strategy is to undermine any hope of a Ukrainian military victory and to force negotiations...To be realistic, Ukraine is not getting out of the Russian sphere, at least not completely.

From the beginning, Kiev has short-sightedly resisted shoring up political support in the East, refused to negotiate, made ridiculous demands, and stupidly gotten themselves into an unnecessary military conflict that they cannot afford and which will eventually bankrupt them.

Apparently, same went for legal military bases in Crimea - according the treaties between Russia and Ukraine military personnel should have remained within the boundaries if this bases. The same approach was used by Pres Putin when he planned his election for 3rd term. Does it ring a bell?","The military intimidation in the Crimea, the control of flights out of the country, the abuse of the press, and all the masked soldiers wandering around with guns and other weapons made this a travesty of self determination.  Add in the outright bribes from Putin about raised military pensions, and the silent voices of the minorities there, as well as the petty concerns about lack of electricity and water without Ukraine's cooperation, and you have the picture of a modern military takeover.  If this were a true Russian Spring, the troops would not be around and all the suppression and propaganda would not have been necessary.  The fact that young people in the Crimea are seeing through this mockery is encouraging.  Maybe the older people including Putin long for the glory days of the Soviet Union with all their captive nations, but this is the 21st century.  This can't stand, and would set up too many precedents for other countries with Russian minorities in them.","@Betty S. - What made you think that the corporate oligarchs are any better then plain and simple Russian oligarchs?  The latter afforded their inalienable right to help former Lt-Col Putin become the president and transform Russia into the biggest privately own corporation in the world. ..As for the 83 voter turnout with no SuperPac ad campaigns and swiftboating smears, there was enough of both, Russian style, plus guns on the street and intimidation of opposition.",,,,,
SA,,,,"Let Putin take as much territory as he wishes. He will lose it back very soon - when Russia implodes like the Soviet Union did and when Eastern Ukrainians realize what a bad deal they got (like many Crimeans and Russians already begin to realize). The great absurdity is that the last thing Russia needs is more territory. What it needs urgently is a functioning economy..Instead, the US and Europe should invest rapidly and heavily in Ukraine's economy and modernization..Nevertheless, do send defensive weapons if that can keep the death toll in check, especially among civilians, most of whom care more about their survival and economic well-being then about the twisted logic of Putin's sick mind. Save lives, not positions, and do so unapologetically. Putin already has too many dead Syrians on his conscience and should not be allowed to continue on his killing spree - at any cost.","Watching the news footage of UkrainianRussian thugs violently taking over local government buildings and violently attacking peaceful pro-Kiev marchers is just too reminiscent of how Hitler came to power in the 1920's and early 1930's. I have no idea what Putin's long-term goals might be for Russia or himself--but his tactics so far make it seem that he has discovered a twenty-first century analog to Hitler's cunning use of violence, intimidation, fear, deceit, and manipulated elections. ..I don't know how much of the early protests against the government in Kiev--or the proposed EU agreement--may have been aided by the desire of the West to hedge Putin in. But I don't think the West should behave now as if influencing or controlling Ukraine is all that interests Putin; nor should we assume that--if his tactics cannot effectively be countered now--he won't be emboldened by his success to try them elsewhere.","I think Obama is going to send defensive weapons to Ukraine. He cannot afford another 'red line' skipping after the notorious one in Syria - unless Putin comes up with something really tempting - like the chemical weapons agreement then. Putin is not diplomatic. He uses these summits as moves on his autistic chessboard. Since he only understands power, he should be met with power, not necessarily military, but really painful in other ways. He is bluffing and I think the US strategy will outsmart him. Russians may be better at chess, but Americans are better at poker.","After the collapse of the Soviet Union, there is now a serious possibility of Russia falling apart, with dire consequences for the rest of the world. Putin is a cornered mouse - of his own doing - with a finger on the nuclear trigger. How far his believing his own lies will take him is anyone's guess. Managing diplomacy with such a madman playing his own chess game is a very serious challenge. Let's hope a more sober 'strongman' kicks him out of his beloved 'big table' (mentioned by Ray Finch below).","Re: I pray we are not descending into another cold war. Putin is stuck in his KGBCold War mode. The rest of the world has moved on, while Russia enjoys little following from other nations, let alone many nationalities within its borders. He is a major nuisance. Let's not forget that there would not be so many dead and so many refugees in Syria, and most probably no ISIS either, if it was not for his support for Assad. Instead of a cold war, we have now an ugly alliance of dictators and would-be dictators (in Russia, China, Iran, Turkey, Venezuela) all scared stiff of their impending demise, which unfortunately will also have dire consequences on each one of us in the highly interdependent world we live in now.","The Ukrainian government is doing some stupid things: starving people, unleashing the Azov battalion, etc. But so do most countries at war. There is a mirroring of insanity that takes place and large numbers of civilians are always the main victims of the use of force. (The Allies bombing Dresden...) Putin's cynicism is akin to that of Hamas: the more Ukrainians die, the more his bid for annexation gathers momentum. It is quite amazing that the majority of Russian people don't mind having a bloodthirsty Mafia don for president.","Only a couple of days ago, Erdogan lamented that Westerners do not like Muslims, but do appreciate their oil and money. How many Muslims' blood does Putin have on his hands - Chechens and Syrians by the 100s of thousands? I guess Erdogan doesn't like Russians either (who does he like, anyways, besides ignorant and hypocritical Islamists?) but he seems to like their money enough to silence his usual unbridled self-righteousness.","Only a couple of days ago, Erdogan lamented that Westerners do not like Muslims, but do appreciate their oil and money.

Pablo,,,,"It is American backing for the overthrow by force of a democratically elected President that started this mess in motion...And it was the democratic citizens of the Ukraine that asked for that backing, after seeing their president come under the dangerous and bizarre spell of Lord Putin. And because the Ukraine is a sovereign, independent nation--which owes absolutely nothing to Russia, Lord Putin, or even a few separatists being paid by Putin's strong-men--they can do whatever the heck they like. That's what is normally called democracy. Pericles came up with the idea in ancient Greece.","This is, of course, naive. To attribute Putin's ambitions in Ukraine to simply the modulation of popularity polls in Moscow is like saying the Chinese invasion of sovereign territorial waters in the South China Sea is only in order to harvest scallops.","If Russia bordered the ISIS-occupied region, we could solve two problems in one fell swoop: Putin's need to prove he's a vital force to the Russian populace, and the US need to infiltrate the ISIS territory in Syria. Two birds. One stone. After all, Putin is fantastic at waging secret wars, claiming he is not, and then turning around to be the good peace broker.","The Russian government, with its systematic oppression and denial of human rights and murders of journalists, homosexuals, and any one else who would resist their totalitarian oppression, simply can't be trusted to behave themselves, because they have invaded, and stolen, The Crimea, and now support armed gangs trying to usurp Eastern Ukraine - a sovereign territory...So Putin's armed gangs need to allow the international authorities in right away, no excuses. ..And yes: the Ukrainian government should not be involved, because that is what impartial means.","What is the difference between these conflicts? you ask?..First of all, Putin is not defending himself against anything at all. He is doing his best to twist, lie, swindle, and usurp sovereign territory for his own purposes. ..We, on the other hand -- and many of our allies -- have high confidence that the death cult know as ISIS (remember? That's the one that beheads little girls in the midday sun, in front of their parents, because they are infidels) is rabidly determined to bring its terror on our heads...I cannot think of two situations more profoundly different. And here you are, seemingly on a different planet, demanding that there is no difference. It's bizarre, actually. But the two situations you present so confidently as analogous are entirely different.","Think about it this way: if you're so bent on equating what Putin is doing with similar actions we've made in the past (and I do not deny them), please also consider where you would like to live the rest of your life. Would you rather live in a country that kills its journalists, persecutes gays, excoriates Jews, and is actively reviving the gulag system? As for me I would rather live in the States -- warts and all -- because, well, it is much, much more open and free and happy than Putin's Neo-colonial Russia. ..In sum, herein lies the reason that we must resist Russia: they are now an imperial system that is determined to spread the very same horribly oppressive system to other areas of the world (read: The CrimeaUkraine).","I don't care who it is, neocons or aliens, with whom Ukraine has joined in partnership. Absolutely none of it in any way justifies a Russian invasion. The Ukraine is a sovereign nation state. If it so desires to partner with anyone to do anything--outside of invading Russia (I'll let you ponder the irony)--it is none of Putin's business. Yours is a mish-mash of straw man arguments, which serve simply to deflect from the violent and unconscionable violation of Ukraine nation-state sovereignty.","Dear comrade vova, as much as it is clear that your heart has undying devotion to the Great Comrade Putin, I urge you to consider your propaganda techniques. ..FIrst of all, you are certainly right to brazenly twist violations of human rights and territorial sovereignty into humanitarian acts intended by the Great Leader, as you have done here: Putin was right to annex Crimea, cause there would have been thousands of corpses now, had he not done it...However, dear comrade, I urge you to characterize the Great Leader's intentions in less dogmatic terms, as such words may, though tragic, place doubt in the mind of the capitalist-pig readers who would impune His infinitely compassionate intentions to the poor children of the New Russia. I recommend I believe Putin's annexation (which was unfortunately because of the accidental incursion of thousands of Russian troops, military, and weapons batteries) has prevented the horrible suffering of millions of children, who the United States despises...Again, comrade, do not be discouraged...Hail the Motherland and her defender The All-Compassionate Putin.","I don't think Russia want all of Ukraine...Russia does not want all of Ukraine. Ah, I see. How compassionate, rational, and calculated Putin is to make the strategic decision to steal only part of the Ukraine.","@R36 - Um. Not sure if you heard the news?

It doesn't matter if its a hawk or a dove as POTUS, the fact is there is little we can actually DO.  Putin has had his chance to gracefully deescalate this crisis, easily securing the ethnic Russian population while honoring his treaty obligations and looking like a hero.

It was a fools errand that never could have worked, and we all know how that ended. Whether we like it or not, a large number of the people in the eastern Ukraine are Russian, not Ukrainian. Let's say we armed the Ukrainians and they (however unlikely) defeated Russia militarily. We would still wind up with the impossible task of convincing a war-weary Russian-speaking population that they would rather be Ukrainians. It won't work, especially when Russia's lurking in the background causing trouble. Realistically whether we arm the Ukrainians or not, Russia will win this war militarily. But once Putin puts his mission accomplished banner away, he will likely find himself in the exact same situation of trying to convince the other half to that mixed population that they would rather be Russians and not Ukrainians. It won't work out too well for him. Especially once it becomes obvious that Russia is in no condition to keep the promises that they will wind up making to try to win over the hearts and minds.","I can't tell if it's my own paranoia or if it's well-placed suspicion, but so many of these comments read as if they were penned by The Agency, Putin's online commenting troll-factory (See: <a hrefhttp:www.nytimes.com20150607magazinethe-agency.html titlehttp:www.nytimes.com20150607magazinethe-agency.html targetblank>http:www.nytimes.com20150607magazinethe-agency.html<a> ).

This is an important point to stress, Assad is murdering his own citizens in order to stay in power. There is no grand human Geopolitical theory to be tested here; there is no excuse at all. Suppression of peaceful airing of grievances to a sovereign, peaceful airing of facts and reason, this is what tyrants fear most, and it is what Putin fears most...The world is complex, but Assad is employing the tactic Putin wishes to reserve for himself--killing his own people because they are thinking for themselves. There is no excuse for this.","Poroshenko should use his head and return the 10 soldiers to Putin as a show of good faith. Put the pressure on Putin to take the high road. Putin doesn't realize that he could be a hero if he were to let Ukraine be. Come on Vladimir, be a hero!",Putin cannot face up to what he has done. The body language in the lead picture heading the article says it all.,Too early to tell but I think Putin blinked. Obama gave Putin a way out while being able to save face.
MoCrash,,,,Give Putin time and the tricolor flag will be replaced by the hammer and sickle on red.,"Almost immediately after his election in May, Poroshenko signed a trade agreement with the EU. So if Putin's objective is to keep Ukraine from doing business with the rest of the world, he's thus far failed miserably...Given Russia's provocative acts and interference in Ukraine's affairs, it is time to begin discussion of whether Ukraine should join NATO for its own protection against a militarily superior and aggressive neighbor. Then we'll see whether the big Russian bear is so bold.","And herewith is an example of how systemic propaganda distorts reality. In the Russian mind, Mr. Putin must seem totally justified in is aggression. To the free world, the perception is entirely different, and accurate.","While I admit Russia has legitimate interests in Crimea, I fail to see a threat to Russia compelling enough to warrant military intervention. Were Russia's military bases threatened? Hardly. Were Crimean Russians being harmed? No. This is simply an instance of Putin taking advantage of the present instability of the Kiev government to grab territory. Putin is a leopard whose spots have never changed from the Cold War KGB thug (ousted for his failed coup against Gorbachev) he has always been, one who has never fully reconciled with the notion of independence of Ukraine (and other former Soviet satellites) from a USSR he would dearly love to re-establish.","Most of the Western businesses Putin could nationalize provide consumer services, so that would only hurt the Russian people. If Russia cuts natural gas to Europe, it will damage its own economy since it will lack viable markets. And Russia could lose its permanent seat and veto power in the U.N. Security Council. Any Putin reaction to the West's sanctions would probably hurt Russia more than the West.","While I admit Russia has legitimate interests in Crimea, I fail to see a threat to Russia compelling enough to warrant military intervention.

Russia is not under siege, it's the aggressor. While NATO has not expanded east beyond Poland and the western Black Sea states, it is the mere threat of stronger Ukrainian economic ties to the EU (can it be blamed, given Russia's shaky economy?) and his desire for a return to Soviet-style domination of the region that motivates Putin. His hands are all over the demonstrations in eastern Ukraine (even if the Times board is careful not to make the claim without solid documentation). While Americans are tied of futile wars, Putin's imperialism must be halted somewhere -- and Ukraine's border would seem the appropriate line. If Russian troops cross, NATO should act (even though Ukraine is not a member) to send Putin the only message a former KGB thug can understand.","So let's just sit back and wait until Putin reconstitutes the old Soviet Union. Is that an acceptable alternative, or is it more rational to exert increasing pressure on Russia after its incursions into Georgia, Crimea and possibly eastern Ukraine amd Moldava? Putin's intentions are obvious; it's time he also understands their consequences.","I'm not sure Putin is smarter than EU leadership -- if so, he could have gotten Crimea without force -- but he is certainly more cunning.","Putin only seems to want ... political freedoms for Ukrainians. That makes him appear reasonable. But, of course, once eastern Ukraine is under Russian control, those freedoms will be no greater than those granted to Russian regions."

I hope Obama is looking for a deal that does NOT cost the American taxpayers more than the 1 billion Kerry promised Ukraine..The Oligarchs will steal 12 of that money; check their in London in 6 mos..Russia buys Crimea from Ukraine under pressure on both from Germany &amp; US.  Maybe costs them a bit more than the 15 billion provided by the EU. Crimea was part of Russia before US existed.

God forbid they should admit President Obama had played this thing about right.,"President Obama is central to America's decline in the world.  Obama sees the world in his terms believing that his view and utterances will change the situation but does nothing to shape the outcome.  Kerry and he seem astonished that Putin a known bully invaded another country, especially one where the Russian navy's lone warm water port is located. How naive! And what does Obama do? He talks and talks and talks. But does nothing to punish Russia...Obama has this delusional belief thatRussia will aid with Iran and Syria. Meanwhile the mullahs March onto a nuclear future. And Assad a few years past the deadline set by Obama for him to leave Syria is more powerful than ever...But then again this is a clueless man when it comes to world affairs. Heis tough on our allies, Israel and Colombia, but easy on Russia and Syria. He sells out Poland and the Czech Republic believing the Russians will owe him one...Obama is a weak president well in over his head.  He is not respected and certainly not feared.  His reduction of the US military to pre WW II levels only reinforces our nation's decline to our adversaries.",,,,,,,

Kennedy quickly rejected any plans to invade Cuba.  In the end, the missiles were removed and Cuba remained an independent nation headed by a government deeply opposed to the US...There is no current plan to place nuclear weapons in Ukraine.  Putin is invading to assure that Ukraine remains an obedient client of Moscow.","The interesting question for future historians:..Has Putin overestimated his influence over the pro-Russia factions in Eastern Ukraine -- or -- is this just another idle gesture that Putin has no interest in honoring?..Personally, I strongly suspect the second.  There are no reports of Russian forces moving back from the border or any public calls from Russia for the factions to back down.  He'll just sit back and let the problems fester until he's forced to intervene in order to protect fellow countrymen.","Markets typically have a short memory.  They may fall for a while following the sanctions, but it's also very likely that they will soon recover, either because the West quietly reduces the sanctions a few months from now, or Russia finds work arounds to minimize their impact.  ..The big challenge will be to find effective means to make then endure long enough to have an impact on Putin's policies.

We also embargoed Iranian oil. Now Putin buys 500,000 barrels per day at low prices and sells it to the west at retail prices. Without the Iraq War, Putin would not be sitting in the Crimea and on the border across from Kharkov and Donyets. The Iraq War was bad for Iraq, bad for America, and very good for Russia.  Now we are at at disadvantage if we try to defend a far away country about which we know little. However, it must be done or Putin will continue his march to the West. Clearly, a land war fought in Ukraine would be difficult for America to wage. However, there are ways to push back on Russian aggression. Take even one division of American troops in Poland and move them to Poland. Increase the numerosity of fighters in the Baltic republics. Also, drop the boycott on Iranian oil (the third largest stream in OPEC), and buy directly from the Iranians. The Israelis will not like it, but I don't bloody care.

Putin acted as any sane head of state woukd when the US backed a coup right on Russia's borders, and for all his flaws, has artfully played a limited hardball game against what is wuite frankly US aggression...As the US smiles upon a new Ukrainian regime that looks comprised of neo-NAZIs, corrupt oligarchs, and foreign carpet-baggers granted overnight citizenship and lucrative government posts by Petro Poroshenko - including the former President of Georgia who is wanted in his homeland for embezzlement and human rights abuses - the Times takes ots credibility and burns it when you publish these pieces...Screed after screed ...","Whereas the US taxpayer fuels the Ukrainian side. Talk about crowdfunding!..The Times has a vendetta with Putin and Russia, and the reporting is nakedly vendetta-driven. The reporting also totally lacks any balance at this point. Its just amazing that somehow the Public Editor hasnt been forced to confront the unbalanced and vendetta-driven reporting.","The cease-fire will not hold: the West (US neoconservatives and Cold War retreads) wants all of Ukraine brought into its sphere, attempting to topple Putin and ultimately force regime change in Russia, and Putin must have a viable security buffer against Western aggression. Nor will Western (ie, American) escalation work, as Ukraines NAZI stormtroopers and hapless conscripts will never defeat the Russian-backed proxy fighters. ..Russia has won this fight, and the US er the West must accept that there are limits to what aggression and encroachment any powerful nation will allow on its borders. The US-backed oligarchs in Kiev will have to accept a limited domain...And, someday, the Times will actually have to publish the photos of Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers running around with SS and Swastika symbols on their helmets.","So, Putin is frightened in Syria of mass protest because that was part of what led to the downfall of the USSR...This sounds like official Washington propaganda to me...I suspect very much that Russia has not moved into Syria because Putin is terrified Russia will cease to exist if freedom (ie, the jihadis the US arms and backs via Saudi Arabia) takes over...In fact, Putin's move does not look like fear per se at all. It was a very well-timed move to shore up the dictator Assad, and to protect the Russian presence (and naval base) in the Middle East...Hopefully, Russia will succeed in reducing just a little bit the chaos that the US has created in the Middle East over the last 13 years starting with a war of choice, based on lies, in Iraq...On a different note, I am very tired of the official Washington pose that the US stands for freedom and human rights in the Middle East whereas (gasp!) Putin is backing an eeeviiiiillll regime. The US has backed and continues to back some of the most oppressive, brutal regimes in the world in the Middle East. Official Washington has no credibility whatsoever criticizing Russia for backing Bashar al-Assad.","Certainly, economically attacking Russia will generate such pro-Western good will there and will undermine Putin. This is because, clearly, Putin has never been a popular figure in Russia at all, having never been popularly elected or seen as anything but a dictator there. And certainly Russia has never shown the ability to develop its own economy while being shunned by the West. Clearly isolating Russia economically I","Putin is only doing what any Russian leader would do, and it is pathetic the degree to which US policy on Ukraine has simply resulted in Russian expansion.","Given that the samctions Russia faces, the US drove because Putin didnt let the US get away with a coup in Ukraine, and the price of oil is dropping, Putin is absolutely correct that outside forces are at work...In particular, the US has not just been a rogue actor, but an outright scoundrel, in backing a coup in Ukraine. This was a shameful and needlessly destructive exercise in imperialism and gamesmanship that has cost thousands of lives and created havoc for no reason of importance to the American people...I feel sorry for the people of Russia, who are victims of American power games, and I feel sorry for the A.erican people, as we have a regime here now that will do nothing to address our economic and other plights, but will easily unite behind foreign adventures and imperialism.","More of the Western triumphalism that Gorbachev soeaks of. The degree of gloating from Putins enemies over the damage that the US-driven sanctions against Russia have caused is disheartening indeed and it remain shocking, the willingness and zeal if the Times in participating...More to the point - Russia is not going to roll over and let the West take Ukraine by coup, at least not without a large security boundary. That issue is not about Putin per se. No responsible head of state in Russia would allow the US to get away with such a blatant coup and in such a critical place, right on Russia's border. Ukraine is a stones throw from Moscow, and corresponds to Russias only direct access to warm water. No Russian head of state would let the US get away with such a move, and that is also placing aside the last century of history in the region that saw the Ukrainian Fascists the Times is backing side with Hitler in WWII and cause millions of Russian deaths...The Times has succeeded in all of the most critical elements of war propaganda:.. invert victim and aggressor.. obscure history.. obscure economic interests.. demonize and personalize endlessly.. monopolize coverage..The Times should be aware that a lotnof its readers can see this happening, and that credibility is a precious thing that, once squandered, is difficult indeed to recover.","Thanks for reporting on major aspects of the crisis that the Times is unwilling or unable to report on, and balancing just a bit their latest daily hit piece on Putin and Russia."
LW,,,,"Given the apparent willingness of Pres. Putin to gamble aggressively, and the probable rage that he is likely experiencing because of his proxies severely embarrassing him with their incompetence -- and the possibility that they may be even more embarrassing should any be taken into custody -- I wonder whether he is considering using the incident as a pretext to launch the regular Russian military into crushing the Donetsk People's Republic, making a show of apprehending and killing the clowns implicated in this incident, and staying for the long term on the excuse that clearly Kiev had lost control and could not impose order on such a lawless region.  He strikes me as a terrible man to disappoint.","But if your counter part is of a late 19th, early 20th century rationale, diplomacy is pointless and caters to Putin's belief: the west is too weak and indecisive to meet and confront Russia militarily.'.....which is confirmed by all historical evidence so far, to his advantage.","Preservation of the military facility at Tartus, which is the sole remaining Russian military facility outside the former domain of the USSR...There's also prestige at stake, with Putin more than happy to show the world that Russia's government has more resolve than that of the United States.","He'd have to move quickly and in force, because it might be problematic for him if any of the leaders saw a betrayal coming and decided to surrender to Ukrainian authorities with evidence and a willingness to testify about Russian arms transfers, rocket artillery support, and other assistance that Pres. Putin has been steadfastly denying.","The answer of course is nothing since there was no sudden invasion...The answer, of course, is that Putin gains very little from an actual annexation of impoverished eastern Ukraine ex-Crimea; unlike the Crimean peninsula, he would gain no more petroleum resource rights nor land underneath a military base.  He's keeping Kiev off-balance and in no shape to enter the European Community, and that's all he needs...If eastern Ukraine had a thriving economy or a huge reservoir of natural gas instead of worn-out mines and obsolete industry, it'd be a different story.","Preservation of the military facility at Tartus, which is the sole remaining Russian military facility outside the former domain of the USSR...There's also prestige at stake, with Putin more than happy to show the world that Russia's government has more resolve than that of the United States.",,,,

The open question is will he be able to enjoy those holdings to the end of his natural life?

Russia is not the Soviet Union and Putin is desperate. His 'cards' have all but run out.,"President Obama &amp; Sec'y Clinton severely criticized Mitt Romney in 2012 for his statements that Russia was an adversary.  They were going to push a reset button for the U.S. Russia relationship.  Their reset has not gone well..   The U.S. &amp; NATO backed an overthrow coup in the Ukraine to get rid of a pro-Russian leader, replacing him with a pro-Western leader, not waiting for the scheduled democratic elections.  Now Obama's team wants NATO to send military support to this new regime..   Looking back at history, Ukraine &amp; the Crimea have been part of Russia throughout the modern era--until 1989, only 26 years ago. And Russia was disastrously invaded from the West in two world wars.  They remember that, and have every right to feel uncomfortable with Western military forces on their borders. President Putin is simply playing a strong diplomatic game on behalf of his country. His leadership in the Syrian chemical weapons issue was very helpful.  He really might be right on the need to resolve the ISIS issue first.","Western cultural incursion and appeal managed to penetrate the Soviet dictatorship and it will continue to penetrate the Putin dictatorship.  When speaking of the cultural stasis of Orthodox Christianity, one must consider that its relevance was promoted and exploited by the Soviets long before Putin expropriated it for his own ends.    The cultural intransigence perceived by Mr. Cohen is akin to racism in America:  It's political usefulness depends on the immediate political expediency...Insofar as sending a message to Putin by significant deployment of heavy weapons, consider the messages already sent when the West reneged on its promise to not  move NATO one inch East.  The conventional wisdom that Russia must be contained by a huge military buildup by all European nations and the US is a recipe for disaster and is so 20th century.  Putin has the nukes and no amount of conventional hardware on its borders will discourage him.  A visible military threat will only increase  Putin's popularity and escalate the situation to an horrific potential.","Shock and surprise- Massive Political Corruption and Betrayal of U.S. National Security for Foreign Cash Which Flowed into the Clinton Foundation coffer as Russians Putin Gained 51 Control of U.S. Uranium Company, via Uranium One, and 15 of the World's Unranium supply...This story of political corruption and betrayal has been suddenly spotlighted, unearthed, due to the outing of Hillary Rotten Clinton's massive foreign money acquisition while she was Sec of State, and her husband Bill Clinton was coordinating the deals himself, by Peter Schweizer in his just released book Clinton Cash. ..Having read the NY Times article, I can say it's  written very extensively to the authors credit, establishes the Clinton's hands of influence and manipulation for their personal and political acquisition gain, at the cost of U.S. National Security.  ..This is but just one example of the blatant political and or legal corruption, graft, and greed- for whatever political and or personal reasons, that is the parasitic poisonous cancer that is rotting the very core fabric of our body politic, destroying the pillars of our Constitutional Republic. ..At what point constitutes aiding and abetting the enemy of America- aka Treason, as a High Crime by a US President and his Cabinet, which is punishable by Articles of Impeachment. Apparently no one in Congress knows and wants to know, let alone cares.","Something of interest here that should not go unnoticed is that these latest Clinton scandals are coming from the left, not the right. Putin probably covered his bets by hacking HRC's Blackberry and iPads. The DNC understands this and knows that Putin owns the Clintons. The only thing that can upset this reset is for HRC's campaign to fail. This appears certain now that the left has joined with the right in outing the truth. It makes sense because the insiders on the left would have no trusted sources except those on the left like the NY Times and Newsweek to which they can leak these anti-Clinton revelations. As witnesses emerge to put context to these hypothetical conspiracies, we should begin seeing calls for a special prosecutor. The evidence for this is mounting and the co-conspirators are lawyering up. The first to flip gets the best deal. Stay tuned.","Take away from this lesson is Diplomacy without backup force is hot air..Glad that the US has not been directly involved.  Merkel and Hollande deserve this dress down because by now they shouldve learned that the mantra that theres no other way to stop this conflict but diplomatic is truncated by backed by economic and other means.Unfortunately European leaders are trying to stop a robbery in progress with a copy of Criminal Code  Robber knows hes wrong but he hasnt been caught yet.  Victim needs to call the cops  Shes calling but only gets an advice from 911 operator what else to give to the robber so he leaves.The US and Europe is not about to send in German, British, Dutch, American or even Polish soldiers to die so that the two brotherly nations of Russia and Ukraine stop killing ea other, and rightfully so..The economic war works half way well so far.  I believe, if it wasnt for swift response in implementing it the situation would be much worse.  So, at this point economic war is it.

Putin will do what he would want anyway but if he knows that there are some more potent defenses he may think twice before sending his crack troops in  Otherwise, demoralized already, if Ukraine army quit fighting being incapable of any defense because of lack of sufficient weaponry from western friends, that would be a damn shame on us all.","It is in everyone's interest to stop this tin pot dictator. Putin is on borrowed time and the longer this stretches out the worse for Putin. He will run out of money with the price of oil so low.

Pierre Guerlain,,,,"In spite of the rhetoric Obama &amp; Putin (that is the US &amp; Russia, of course) are working together to some extent over Syria and that is good news as was their cooperation over the nuclear deal with Iran. Putin is autocratic and supports Assad the butcher, Obama has his kill list and terror Tuesdays and supports the beheaders of Saudi Arabia. This is the Hobbesian we live in. If the carnage stops in Syria this cooperation between shady characters will prove beneficial..Obama at least spared the Middle East, America and the world another Iraq-type war (though he did Libya which plays a key role in the current refugee crisis). So better than Bush--even if one does not forget about drones.","Roger Cohen should read the articles by his namesake Steve Cohen of The Nation for his suggested solutions are just red rags leading to war. Putin is, of course, no angel, authoritarian and not a real democrat. But writing: Force is the language Putin understands better than any other is a clue that Roger Cohen uses a typical colonial, imperial rhetoric (just substitue Arab, Indian, or indeed Jew for Putin and you have the typical xenophobic stereotype).  Arming Ukraine means making sure war there will last as long as in the Middle East, not taking the specificity of Crimea into account is short sighted (yes Russia violated international law, like the West in Kosovo, Iraq, even Libya...but do Crimeans really want to be part of Ukraine?) Is the US willing to fight Russia on the ground, is the EU willing to bail it out financially? The answer is no, so now what the West should do is what Obama started with Iran: aim for a peaceful livable solution with an enemy. The EU and Russia should work together to boost the Ukrainian economy. Merkel is more subtle than Roger Cohen even if she also sometimes blocks possible steps towards peace..The analogy with Hitler does not work on many levels (just read Stephen Walt on this). Diplomacy is what you do with bad guys and the Russian fear of being encircled is not so paranoid (Read Mearsheimer in the NY Times)..The language of force is yours Roger Cohen and it prepares military disasters.","It is a good thing that the New York Times also published John Mearsheimer's column today. Roger Cohen has a recipe for starting WWIII. Steve Cohen of The Nation has aptly deconstructed this dangerous rhetoric (watch his talk on Democracy Now! <a hrefhttp:www.democracynow.org201523isukraineaproxywesternrussia titlehttp:www.democracynow.org201523isukraineaproxywesternrussia targetblank>http:www.democracynow.org201523isukraineaproxywesternrussia<a>.I remember the last time America had found its monster to destroy : Saddam Hussein of Iraq who was called a new Hitler like Putin and the possessor of weapons of mass destruction. Hussein was indeed a despot and a thug but the demonization of the Iraqi leader only served the war party..Bear-baiting is a dangerous activity for the baiters too. Putin is not a nice guy (though he came to America's help in 2001, remember?) the West should work with Putin, stop baiting the bear and engineer a compromise in Ukraine.The  Iraq war was a disaster for Iraq, the US & the world (even if Hussein was got rid of). Can we stop and learn our lessons here? NATO should not expand to Ukraine and Putin for all his defects could be made to save face and accept a compromise. Just read Mearsheimer the answers are there. If war in Ukraine spread to Europe the US would not be protected. Roger Cohen on this point what you need are day-vision goggles.","Countering propaganda with propaganda is not convincing. Countless observers on the ground, reporters for various papers  in the US &amp; Europe and specialists have pointed out that there are divisions in Ukraine. On the site of the NY Times there is even a video showing that part of the population feels close to Russia &amp; approves of what Putin did (a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty for sure). The myth is that there is a myth. One should be serious even when reporting about one's enemy otherwise it's my propaganda vs his propaganda. Look at the results of the 2010 election and listen to the angry crowds in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.","Pressure on Mr Putin maybe but also pressure on the Kiev government which is also responsible for crimes (Odessa, for instance) and enlisted the support of non-democrats and thugs to oust the previous corrupt government. The West is also punishing itself with sanctions which will have a minimal impact on Russia's actions but will mostly make China stronger. The West is throwing Russia into China's arms for in the long term China will be the senior partner in any Russia-China association. With Western sanctions, Beijing is laughing all the way to superpowerdom..The best way for diplomacy would be for the West to acknowledge its mistake when it chose to enlarge NATO (violating promises made to Russia) and work out an agreement with Russia that would guarantee Ukraine's safety and reassure Russia that there is no new Cold War targeting it. Finlandization, it's called..The regime is Russia is unpalatable on many counts but geopolitics is not a discussion among friends.

Yes the key question is how does one deal with such countries in order to avoid war or major conflicts? The US has a kind of duopoly with China, a country whose human rights record is far from stellar. The US itself with CIA torture, NSA surveillance and undercover operations in many parts of the globe is not exactly  a model of respect for human rights &amp; democracy. Since China is so important for the US (and Walmart too) the talk about human rights is subdued in relation to Beijing. With Russia the US should have the same pragmatic approach it has toward China or now Cuba. As John Mearsheimer shows in his Foreign Affairs article last fall the West is in large part responsible for Russia's hard pushback. The pushback does not make Putin a nice guy, that is besides the point. Extending NATO eastward is a provocation for Russia and now Ukraine is moving toward this organization..With vile rgimes the Hippocratic method should apply too: do no harm and do not make life worse for the already stricken populations (as happened after Western intervention in Libya). The US should engage Russia &amp; the EU to work for peace in Ukraine. A modus vivendi can be reached, even with nasty rgimes or leaders, as the China example shows. Helping Ukraine become wealthier with Russian cooperation would be a good start. The Victoria Nuland approach is a recipe for the fire next time.","This piece is almost comical, especially the quote by Bush arguing that Putin was not well-informed as if W knew anything about the world. Psychologizing gets you nowhere when you try to understand geopolitics. Putin is certainly not a nice guy but then nice guys kill others with drones, don't they?  Russia has moved away from a Western style democracy but is Putin the only person responsible? Not those who lied about expanding NATO? Bush senior had promised not to do it then Russia was humiliated so the US (&amp; the West generally) pushed even more and are now in part responsible for the terrible events in Ukraine. Not working with Russia but imposing neoliberal policies on Yeltsin, expanding NATO and considering that since Russia was down it could be kicked into docility contributed to stoking up the desire for revenge. One cannot support the many human rights violations in Russia, of course, but thinking that all that is happening is the consequence of Putin's tyrannical personality is bypassing the basic issue. Dark-side-Cheney giving his two cents is so funny. Violators of law, international or American, giving lessons about the rule of law is a common but sad spectacle. In a way the bill for humiliation is coming due now. Ugly guy Putin is a product both of Russian history and Western arrogant ignorance.

He failed on the same counts in every regime changefrom AfghanistanIraq to Egypt and Libya.Since the Korea, Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, and our Middle East adventures, our Presidents have followed and disgraced us on the advice of our incompetent intelligence departments...You can wrap Putin's actions in whatever media histrionics you wish, but we initiated this under Mrs Clinton who was starting to bark at both Russia and China while she was still employed by Obama. The whole Ukranian break up was started under her regime while she was running around the world getting pre-election photo ops. She and Obama were as totally wrong as Cheney and Bush about foreign affairs...And so at vast expense we slip one more rung down the ladder and grasp at straws to explain it.

To be the chief of intelligence is a semi-secret power over the public as well as all of its officialdom including the elected, because one knows all of everyone's secrets. The KGB and Stasi and SS were famous for that. ..The FBI, domestically, and CIA have the same attributes. J Edgar Hoover was known for his crime fighting, but it was only insiders who knew the powers he exercised via his secret files with all their skeletons. Who ever heard of Michael Hayden, Leon Panetta or John Brennan or, for that matter, G H W Bush when they were merely Directors of Central Intelligence?

Putin's odd press conference was full of contradictions as a result of this strained effort to justify his act of aggression.","The evidence continues to solidify that Putin's pretext for sending in Russian troops to Crimea is completely flimsy.  Meanwhile, the political, diplomatic and economic costs for Russia have begun to rise.  Like Putin, the committed critics of Obama's response are sounding increasingly desperate.",,,,,,
A,,,,"Talk about a dismal choice. Obama talks with Putin in support of Assad, a man who murdered his own people, some with chemical weapons OR we continue supporting rebels in Syria who have no chance of defeating ISIS, a murdering bunch of thugs who behead people for international television entertainment..Of course Putin, too, is suspected of ordering his F.S.B. ( the successor to his former employer The KGB) to bomb apartment buildings in his own country, along with other atrocities..Obama would have to be Solomon to be able to choose which is the least of these three evils. Murder is murder and he must decide who is the least offensive murderer of the bunch. Yikes.","Very silly psycho analysis of Putey Pute. Of course Russians are a backward people and he must protect them from themselves. Never mind that he personally is worth 40 billion plus and lives like a king. This is the oldest story in the book, arrogance and solipsism, power at all costs. He has 16 months to do as he pleases, while the U.S. sits idly by secure in its thoughtless sense of virtue. The MAIN reason Putin wants to prop up Syria is for access to their warm water port for his navy. There is a power vacuum and Obama's policies have been responsible for millions of refugees and Syrian deaths. I don't think it is possible to make a bigger hash of things. The next president will inherit a disaster. Knowledge without action is nothing. Maybe the next president will have a little courage. Is that too much to ask for?",Ironic that it was Putin's own paranoid actions that led to his worst fear: a stronger NATO.,"What I'm about to write may seem unconnected and yet after reading and watching the news in the last week alone, one thread seems to jump off the screen and pages. Those who are in positions of authority andor trust have needlessly murdered innocent people. Mr. Putin and his cronies are murderers. They used a big missile to carry this out. The Israelis, on orders from Netanyahu  have murdered innocent civilians with their bombings in Gaza. The NYC. police murdered a man on the streets of Staten Island for allegedly selling loose cigarettes..I read all three of these stories as they were the leading headlines in the last week and it all makes me wonder. Over 600 people needlessly killed  on orders from men in positions of power, which means all these deaths were preventable. When will this end?","So, this is playground politics..Rip tootin', sharp shootin', Vlad Putin walks into the middle of the yard and points to the other side of the chain link fence and says I want that sandbox over there, the one by the pond so we can sail our little motor boats around and land in the sand if necessary.It was mine in preschool, after all.  Along comes No Drama Obama, and tries to enlist the help of his battle fatigued cohorts to fend off this Rushin' Russian. He rants &amp; threatens that if Rippin' Vlad sends his goons over that fence he will not curry favor with the good guys. Putin laughs and sends the goon squad over the fence. These looney goons threaten anyone who passes by. As the goon's language is the same as the passers-by language they submit to joining forces with the big red bully. No Drama pounds his chest some more and jumps up and down ranting and raving that Vlad is making him mad and breaking INTERNATIONAL LAW! Yikes! Vlad tells his goons to ask the fence huggers to vote to let him in, and then to stay. No Drama is now chewing the scenery, trying desperately to rally the rest of his buddies in the yard. But, know what? They don't care anymore, they're tired and not only do that not want to be in another fight, they don't even know how to climb a fence or even how to sit on it. They walk away..That's my take. Maybe not sophisticated, or just as sophisticated as the powers that be, one dude bare chested on a horse and the other one chest pounding on a teleprompter.",,,,,
Molly O'Neal,,,,The NYT would make better use of its editorial voice in seeking to find the basis for lowering tensions in Europe rather than in telling us once more how utterly evil is Putin and how baseless any argument he may raise.  The situation does not become less dangerous as long as we keep insisting that the west achieve its maximum goals and Russia be utterly ruined and humiliated.,"A chilling implication of this article is the idea that anyone in the U.S. or Europe who challenges the mainstream account of the Ukraine crisis - its causes and its nature -- is potentially some kind of Russian stooge or agent.  (Oddly, this is precisely the stance that Putin takes to his domestic opponents.)  As James Carden recently wrote in the Nation, there is a whiff of McCarthyism about this and an intolerance dissent.  As far as I'm concerned, we should not be afraid of hearing and debating a full range of ideas about this crisis and everything else.","The article does not mention that Putin proposed putting OSCE monitors on the Ruasia-Ukraine border posts as part of the deal to extend the ceasefire.  It is mysterious to me why the NYT, usually a strong proponent of human rights, is justifying a policy of cracking down on a rebellion by disaffected citizens of Ukraine by use of heavy military means in built up civilian areas.  The US and EU should be working with Poroshenko and Putin to get a renewed ceasefire and negotiations.  The fact that Poroshenko faces a public in Western Ukraine who wants to wipe out its political adversaries suggests that gluing Ukraine back together will be very hard. Every shot fired by Ukraine's military and its volunteer paramilitaries  in the East is driving the local population to hate and fear Kiev, rendering Ukraine ungovernable.","We don't need Putin to define what federalization means.  The U.S.,Germany and Canada are examples. Why should this be an unthinkable fate for Ukraine?  Why is the U.S. backing an unelected government in Kiev and not deploring the use of force against civilians?  Has anyone considered how this affects hearts and minds in the east and south of Ukraine?  It sends the clear message of selective humanitarianism.","Opinion polls show large majorities in the east and south mistrust the Kyiv interim government.  In repeated elections, pro-Russian politicians such as Yanukovych won big in this region.  Why is it hard now to accept that these sentiments would be keenly felt in regions like Donetsk?   Putin did not invent the cultural, linguistic and economic links of majorities in this region to Russia, and their unease about the Ukrainian nationalists of the west pre-dates the current crisis and is genuinely felt. Also, having set the example of taking government buildings by siege in Kyiv, the demonstrators in the east and south might reasonably assume that this is the way to pursue political ends.","U.S. policy toward Russia since 1991 has been to promote the market economy and economic integration in Russia.  This was not wrong, and we should think carefully about scrapping this.   The beneficiaries of this policy, adopted by Yeltsin and not completely squelched by Putin, are stakeholders in a modern and generally pro-western future for the country.  The harm done to them by the sanctions will not necessarily turn them against Putin but rather will push them into silent acquiescence for fear of seeming to side with the enemy that the US has chosen to be.  This will damage prospects for a return to more open and less nationalist stance by Putin or his successor.",,,,

With Europe still trying to extricate themselves from their financial crisis - guess who will have to bail out Ukraine...Putin knows this and has to be laughing...A classic demonstration of power politics and how the Russian bear is still a force to be reckoned with.","Putin's invasion and annexation of Crimea was easy to predict as several responders to this story have said.

Girish Kotwal,,,,"Ian Bremmer has nicely laid down the current policy towards Russia. He calls it tortured because he does not consider the response of the West stern enough to deter any further intrusion by Russia. Most Americans would call the policy pragmatic and Americans by and large have reconciled to Crimea joining Russia, simply because a majority of the residents of Crimea wanted it to be that way. Subsequently, a line in the Crime has been drawn and Russia has been deterred from no more territorial gains. Any further ratcheting of sanctions or an escalation would fuel the flames of animosity that will just shatter the struggling economies and spook the stock market as it has in recent past, unnecessarily. It is time to keep the enemies closer through diplomatic channels and continue to work on areas of agreement while privately expressing a resentment and making any threats about areas of disagreement. By winding down 2 major wars and not placing any new boots on the ground anywhere, President Obama has secured his place in history in the infancy of 21st  century of keeping peace through careful use of the defense forces. The West needs to also understand Putin better, not only as a fierce leader of the Russian people but as a player on the world stage. Any attempts to demonize him, marginalize him and sanction him excessively will be counter productive to world peace. Let us not forget the huge favor he did for us by convincing us not to dive head on into a major Syrian conflict.","World powers should work for the common good of humanity.

As a matter of fact, Putins sobriety stands in stark contrast to the public drunkenness of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin. A lot of people abroad seem to misunderstand Vladimir Putin. As with any performance, you have to know your audience. Putins homage to masculinity (as shown in HOC) would not be targeted at Westerners. The displays of masculinity are targeted to ordinary Russians. Most of Putins power is invisible, and he wields it behind the scenes just like Frank Underwood. He does not show the public how he rigs elections, he just rigs them  and people learn the results. He does not show the public how he threatens oligarchs with jail, he just threatens them privately  and if one steps out of line, he jails a person publicly. He exercises most of his real power behind the scenes, but gives enough public examples to maintain his reputation. And his reputation is enough to keep everyone else in line.

Martin,,,,"Now that he's living in Russia, maybe Eric Snowden can help Putin form a secret service to watch people.  Oh, wait a minute, Snowden was all about exposing the methods of a secret service that was watching people.","You dream on, Roger.  the good guys, bad guys approach to world affairs is always a mistake.  Russia and Ukraine have one important thing in common:  neither country has a tradition of democracy and neither people has true respect for democratic institutions.  There is more than enough corruption to go around in both.  And Putin is understandably opposed to having his neighbor cozy up to and become part of NATO (which shouldn't even exist any more---it was created to prevent the spread of totalitarian communism, which no longer exists in Europe).","I believe the Western part of the Ukraine will end up with Russia. First, there is no way for Russia to support Crimea without a land connection. Second, a large part of the population feels more connected to Russia. During the Soviet Union there was no separation. People were Russians first and Ukrainians second, just like Bavarians are Germans..Third, now that blood is spilled, Mr. Putin will wash his hands, stand back and watch a civil war and at one time soon be urged to protect 'his' people.  The Eastern Ukraine will fall now in his lap..I don't even think it is bad to use WIlson's points when he helped to negotiate the Armistice in 1918. The people should decide to which country they want to belong. If a majority want it then the minority has to conform.  The rump Ukraine around Kiev with its own language with remain and hopefully the better for it. The Dutch separated from Germany because they grew culturally and linguistically apart..I see no reason for us to get involved and risk a shock to the house of cards that our economy has become.","Putin has seriously miscalculated here...By arming these thugs with very sophisticated military weapons, and personnel, he probably presumed they would create a stalemate in eastern Ukraine by controlling the skies, and thwarting the Ukrainian military...People should now understand the SCALE of support, armaments and logistics that Putin has been arming opponents of the Ukraine government. He's very serious about rendering Ukraine a failed state...His comments after this latest disaster, blaming Ukraine, for causing this, are particularly repugnant. He's a dangerous and aggressive thug...He messed up; now he must be made give up Ukraine, and for real this time.","I like the picture of Putin and Ukraine's President-Elect Poroshenko.  Putin has an Oh, it's you. look all over his face!","Russia has to seize the Eastern Ukraine. The Crimea is unsustainable as an island to Russia. It needs a land connection otherwise it would be just an expensive failure. Water, electricity and all supplies have to come through the Ukraine. To expect Russia will not move on is naive..In all its battles General Winter will also be employed by Russia this time. The European economies will be in free fall if Putin turns of the gas, just wait until it gets cold..Now on the other hand, what is the big deal if some area of the Ukraine with a Russian population changes into Russia proper? It is not like IS conquering Yasidi land with the intent to butcher the population..The West and especially Europe has to really think this through. Is it worth to fight Russia to preserve borders that were never meant to be international borders but just provincial demarcations of the Soviet Unions?","Putin is probably the most dangerous and deceitful of all SovietRussian leaders since Stalin...Makes a mockery of when W said he looked into his eyes and saw someone who he could work with. Pure blarney, of course...At the very least, finally the international community has woken up to Putin; he has revealed his hand, and he is not some G8 statesman, but the slippery stone cold killer as befits his KGB training.","Putin is playing to his base and they are eating it up, I'm sure.  Russia is way too big and too powerful to become a pariah.  Those trying to impose that status on Russia would suffer too much.  Even our astronauts depend on Russia to get back home!","It just gets better and better for Putin and Russia.  The proceeds of the financial support that countries in the E.U. and the U.S. will give Ukraine will go to Russia as payment for more expensive energy!  Putin gets to annex the semi-autonomous Republic of Crimea under the rubber stamp of a referendum to be voted by the 75 ethnically Russians there.  And the Obama administration looks like a bunch of impotent fools, which in this case they are.","It's been a long time coming, but Putin has finally revealed his true self to the world..No matter how he played like a western politician, via G8 etc., he never trusted nor liked the west. He is stuck in the old Soviet mindset...The west should come down on him like a ton of bricks, ostracize him and Russia. Wipe billions of the Moscow market. Let him rail against foreign agitators all he wants, and imagined foes (for his domestic audience)..Send him back to Siberia, shirtless."

Dream on.","I'm sorry--I usually agree with you but not this time.  If Putin really wanted to defend Russia he might have done a few things to promote democracy, including civil rights, free press, etc.  But no, he is defending the legacy of the Soviet Union, i.e. governing by corruption and overwhelming force, silencing his opponents by any means necessary, including Soviet style paranoid propaganda and imprisoning or killing journalists.  The man is delusional and well-armed, sort of like our own gun slinging nativists but on a grander scale.

You mean he's been helpful so far?,"I'm not sure Mr. Navalny is asking us to dig in, rather he names the people against whom the sanctions should be imposed in order for Putin to feel their bite.  That makes sense to me.","A school years bully is acting out and you are suggesting that he would stop if only he was shown enough love and respect?  Are you serious?  Russia was powerful in the past, true, but only by way of cruel repression against its own people and aggression against others, and it's now clear that this is also how Putin means to restore Russia's greatness.",,,,,

Face it Vladimir, the Soviet Union failed, its over, deal with it.  ..Its interesting however that the Russians still celebrate May Day and the end of WWII just like the USSR (granted the USSR took the brunt of WWII).  It says to me that the Russians were the USSR and the other counties, like Ukraine, that belonged to it were slaves.  Obviously Putin longs for the restoration of the USSR, but I don't think it will happen unless he goes to war...I had a Russian history professor in college, who ended his Russia in the 20th century course with Stalin becoming the president of the USSR.  According to him, Russian history ended then.  I would imagine he would think the same is happening in Russia today, as long as Putin is allowed to have his way.","It is interesting how when the US courts friends throughout the world, as in the recent overture to Cuba, it is good, but when Putin courts friends throughout the world it is bad.",I'm sue Putin is crying because he can longer play in the G-8.,,,,,,

buzzy,,,,"It fears a Russia with a good standard of living because..there is the possibility that at some time in the future Russia might be ready to join the European Union.Actually, one of the prime reasons for the popular Ukrainian rejection of Yanukovych was his refusal to implement the EU association agreement. Yanukovych instead turned to Russia for deeper economic ties and bailout funds. Russia's reaction has been to invade the Ukraine and threaten other countries Russia borders. Thus, your point about a US fear of Russia joining the EU makes no sense whatsoever. If Russia were to shed its Putin inspired anti democratic policies and apply for EU membership, it would be a great way to push forward benefits to the Russian economy which essentially has no meaningful basis other than natural resources. EU membership would be a boon to the common Russian citizen over the long run..An odd thread in these discussions about Russia is that somehow there is a perception that its economy is comparable to the that of the United States. It is in fact 17 the size of the United States' economy and has no robust manufacturing component. What it does do well under Putin is misallocate resources to military activity at the expense of its common citizens well being.","This book said the same thing your are saying about the world as it existed before WW 1: Norman Angell, Europes Optical Illusion (London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent, 1909). Intertwined national economies upon which wealth and trade depended made war irrational. Irrational it may have been but those priorities did not override small minded national fervor and 10 million died within 10 years..Confronting Putin is the right thing to do but the possibility of conflict is absolutely real.","Richard, do some reading about the Sudetenland. Crimea is not Putin's endgame. Acquiescing to this without consequences is a fool's game. Obama is taking aim at the thugs with padded pockets in Putin's plutarchy. Good start, hopefully more to come.","There is one reason matters are not worse now and that is NATO's existence. Comments that reflect on its current uselessness compeletly miss the nature of Russian behavior it is currently curbing. Absent NATO, Putin would be much more aggressive all along its border. Hopefully, Western Europe will see Putin for what he is - a rational actor practicing realpolitik but certainly NOT a reasonable economicsocial partner.  State management and quelled opposition voices as a method of rule? It is a banana economy almost 1 trillion smaller than France and about 12 that of Germany. It's population is stagnating and predicted to dwindle over the next decade. Putin is lost in a fantasy of the past wherein Russia is a major world power. It is not. Notwithstanding a large military which it apparently needs to protect its colossal borders, it is a middling world presence at best that is capable of making trouble for its neighbors. Unfortunately it is saddled with a leader committed to expending resources asserting its lost position in the world. I think the Germans are smart enough to not follow Putin down a rabbit hole. Hopefully, the French will be smart enough to not deliver the Mistrals and instruct Putin to make sure his population a adequately fed with the return check of 1.8billion.",,,,,,

If Russia goes ahead for the separation of East Ukraine from Ukraine after annexing Crimea this would be the beginning of the end for Russia. ..Russian minorities in Russia and former republics of USSR would be disenfranchised and separation of Eastren Ukraine COULD be detrimental for the unity of Russia.

Denis,,,,"Hello people, sorry for my English, but i dont to pass by your comments..I read many foreign press. And ofcouse i read russian press. I see, that position in Russia and an other World like a day and night. You dont like Putin, i know that, and i know why, because I dont like Obama. But Putin and Kremlin isnt support Ukranian separatist (i dont know why your press names their faces like a pro-Russian, because they are Ukranian citizens with guns, they are dont like new goverment with Poroshenko). Yes, they are wants to be a Russian like a Crimea citizens. Because Ukranian army killing citizens, childrens, destroying living building.

Thank you.","The article states:.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia casting himself as a savior while the objects of his largess try to find a way to avoid taking it..The objects are the people living in Donetsk and Luhansk, not the new Western-backed government of Ukraine and I bet those people are not looking for a way to avoid taking food and medicine.","The Crimea annexation is supported by a supermajority of Russians in my opionion.

Dharma101,,,,"Nice try, Freen, but mockery won't cut it. Russians respect Putin because Putin is very intelligent, very patriotic, very thoughtful and rational, and yes, he is even very moderate, as well as reasonable and straightforward. ..I would suggest you learn Russian and then listen to what he says directly rather than swallowing the Koolaid and bad guy Putin meme served up by our mainstream media and government propaganda artists.",Our allies? You mean the coup-installed Kiev government? Speak for yourself. Those people are not our allies. They are a junta installed by rogue elements that have taken over the US government. Putin is more a friend to the American (and European) people than either that junta in Kiev or the one in Washington DC.,"This video, US Sanctions Explained is a joke pretending to be serious journalism. It makes the assumption that Russia provoked or initiated the crises and the US needs to punish Russia for causing trouble. But just the opposite is true: the US fomented and initiated the crisis through its State Department, Ukrainian and other operatives, overthrowing the elected president of Ukraine and replacing him with unelected people who came to power through a US-backed coup. Russia and Putin have merely been reacting to events on the ground. Most objective observers recognize this and also smell a rat in the plethora of US propaganda, which reeks of falsehood and lying by omission. We are all aware of (and will not forget) the intercepted phone calls of Victoria Nuland and Catherine Ashton, as well as other facts, which, of course, represent just the tip of the iceberg. Technically, the world should be placing sanctions on the US government for its unethical conduct in directly fomenting and committing violence in Ukraine. The brazen hypocrisy and dissembling of the US government in all of this has been breath-taking.","Jiminy, I certainly am not anti-American, though I believe the current US government is. ..US government statements about the crisis mostly do not pass the smell test, whereas Putin comes across as relatively straightforward and transparent. Very few of his words are actually covered by the US mainstream media, which constantly repeats the Putin is to blame meme. But I understand Russian and so can listen to his speeches directly. And, based on what I can see, I respect him. I do not believe he is a liar, unlike the various US government mouthpieces...The current US government does not really represent the American people. though most Americans have not yet learned to detect public lies or read between the lines of mainstream media propaganda...Anyone who has been following the Ukrainian crisis knows about the intimate involvement of the US State Dept. in creating, strengthening, possibly training, and very much supporting and encouraging the coup and its leaders. This is based on strong circumstantial evidence such as the intercepted phone calls and known actions of Victoria Nuland and company, and other facts. ..And now it does appear that US government operatives have been pushing the new Kiev regime to crack down violently on the pro-Russian rebels.","Putin is certainly right in saying that only an insane person would think Russia would attack NATO or one of its countries. Unfortunately, the US government has a lot of insane as well as duplicitous and manipulative people in it. Are they looking for the opportunity for a pretext, say a false flag attack of their own concoction, to start a war with Russia?","Russia is only a fascist military dictatorship in the rhetoric of globalists and Neocons, whose intent is to manipulate public opinion against Russia. Putin has restored a degree of independence, national pride and patriotism to Russia and therefore has an over 85 approval rating among Russians. Putin is definitely not insane. Learn Russian and listen to his speeches, which the US and EU media refuse to broadcast even as they demonize him. He is probably the sanest world leader alive today.","Ukrainians are exercising their right to self-determination on the ground through a referendum in Crimea and armed resistance to an unelected, Western-installed coup government in Kiev. Putin is not imposing anything on them. The real control freaks are in Kiev... and in the US State Department, who are in fact trying to thwart real democracy and self-determination in Ukraine by attempting to crush the resistance through violence.","Jay Casey,.Your statements are exactly the opposite of what is true. It is Putin and not Obama who is smart and thinking several steps down the road. Moreover, Putin is showing courage to do the right thing and not be intimidated by the West's bullies, who are on the wrong side of history. And it is Obama who is the reckless fool by ginning up hostilities with cold war rhetoric and threatening Russia with sanctions and worse in a matter that is none of our business. The West should welcome the triumph of the democracy and the will of the people in Crimea and work closely with Russia to pull Ukraine back from the brink of economic collapse. Neocons, be damned!","If only America had such a leader as Putin -- strong without being a bully, noble-minded, truly patriotic (and not just for show but actually loyal to the Russian people), committed to peace, and not a puppet controlled by Neocons or plutocrats. What a different, more flourishing country America would be.","Me thinks the lady doth protest way too much. Putin is only responding in selfdefense to US Neocon and NATO aggression of both the covert and overt kind. Don't insult our intelligence, NY Times Editorial Board."
Notafan,,,,"Everything you say is true or assuredly true. ..But bear in mind that the Soviet Union suffered an estimated 24 million to 26 million dead in WWII as the Germans did their very worst in and on Soviet territory, including the present Ukraine. ..The Germans  found one of their most willing occupied populations in the Ukraine, whose people aided and abetted them against Soviet Russia and took a more than minor role in carrying out the Holocaust. That experience distorts the Russian view of the world. ..Add a demon like Putin to the mix (and his view is surely influenced by the fact that he is from LeningradPetrogradSt. Petersburg where 900,000 died of starvation caused by a two-year iron German blockade of the city) and there is if not an excuse then at least some explanation for Russia's bad behavior...And yes, all of that being true, Russia and Russians have a very large case of self-pity and a massive inferiority complex going on that empowers the monster in Putin as he bullies the world knowing full well that no one is going to risk a real direct confrontation with one of the two nuclear super powers in the world. ..The last fact is the most inexorable. While a dozen nations that we know of have nuclear weapons only the U.S. and Russia are nuclear superpowers with nuclear arsenals left over from the Cold War that though diminished are still terrible and terrifying in size.","Had it not been Putin it would have been another.  Something deep inside Russia and Russians, in the Russian soul, requires a despot, requires surrender of the vast majority to political and intellectual serfdom and inevitably breeds a determined but futile opposition, the Narodniks, the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks, and today the self-declared Democrats of Russia...Call him Tsar or General Secretary or, now President, Russians require an iron hand whether it is applied in a velvet glove as does Putin by comparison with the steel hammer of Stalin or the ham handedness of those who followed Stalin...But require it they do and they are like lemmings, fleeing freedom into their own sea of misery and resentment of the rest of the world...Putin is Russia's fate. The problem is that also makes him our fate.","Putin blinked. He looked the world's resolve in the eye and resolved to find a way out of his mess and the mess the west can make of his economy and, more than that, having had his hissy fit he now has to find a way down from the crisis he created...The president wins this round and anyone who thinks he didn't is in denial...Chalk one up for resolve, diplomacy and common sense. ..Now Putin owes the west something and it needs to be a sensible way out of the mess in Syria.","With the exception of Gaza, Vladimir Putin is singly, wholly and criminally responsible now for most of the hell happening on the earth. In Syria, in Iraq, in the Ukraine for sure and in a dozen other places his consuming determination to assert Russian power is causing havoc, war and the deaths of tens of thousands...He should be brought before the World Court and Russia should start to pay as a high price as Europe and the U.S. and its Asian allies can exact including shutting down the Russian economy, such as it is, a system based not on production of anything of value except military equipment but on extraction...100 years after Russia helped to instigate WWI, the world needs to tell Putin no more.","1914, the Guns of August...2014, the Guns of March?..Are we all crazy? ..The Crimea belongs to Russia, always did, always will, always should...We are going to do what and threaten what to protect the Ukraine?..The Russians are right about the western Ukraine.

Any national leader in that part of the world who would do what Putin is doing has learned nothing from history...But it is not 1914. It is 2014 and Putin is playing with a keg of nuclear dynamite and Russia needs to get over its inferiority complex.","We live in a nuclear world. That fact is Putin's trump card. Even if military action would be appropriate it is impossible because Russia has one of the two largest nuclear arsenals in the world and at this point it is even possible to conceive that Putin would take that risk. But he doesn't have to because he knows we can't take the chance that he would. ..McCain is a blustering old fool who would do exactly the same as the president were he president and bound by the responsibilities of that office and the limits of its power to change what can't be changed. ..There is nothing we can do ultimately to stop Putin and Russia from doing what they choose in their backyard and he and his henchman Lindsay Graham should just this once do the world and the nation a favor and shut up, just shut up and stop making it worse.",,
Tom Paine,,,,"Some of the comments refer to the US downing of an Iranian airliner as dismissive of US condemnation of Russia. True and similar in the event - the US action was a deplorable mistake taken in a war zone by an incompetent commander and crew. The significant differences, however, and the ones that places the US on higher moral ground, are in the subsequent actions by the US and Russian governments. ..The US admitted its mistake, accepted responsibility, and paid substantial reparations to both the victim's relatives and the airline. To this point, Putin is clearly weaseling the truth by shifting blame to the Ukrainian government - which is rightly attempting to save its country. The Russian allies are compounding this tragedy - and in fact turning it criminal - by their abominable hindrance and looting of bodies at the crash scene...Obama speaking for the US is completely right in delivering a harsh criticism of Putin's Russia and its animal behaving allies. One hopes that Western Europe gathers its collective courage, joins with Obama, and delivers on severe economic punishment towards a here-to-fore unrepentant Russia.","Isn't there something strange about Obama criticizing Putin's Syrian intervention by cautioning Putin against entering into a quagmire. Actually Obama meant it as a warning; but does it sound like a warning? It's clear that the US - specifically Obama - has no influence on Putin's behavior. The wily KGB Putin has to sense that he can just about pull off any aggresive military action and not be countered by the US because, well, he hasn't...And so too China with its escapade into constructing military facilities atop atolls in the South China see and claiming vast sea areas without impediment from the US. Or even any reasonable serious counter. Under Obama US world leadership has receded - deliberately, it appears - as a function of policy. And into the resultant vacuum steps a couple of very powerful bullying nations. And they are not going away; and more likely to get more active...Despite the facts on the ground the Obama fans and apologists insist that he is doing a great job in foreign affairs; keeping us from wars; keeping our military in check; effectively dealing with ISIS and the refugee problems; and creating an opening to Iran - oh wait - Iran is joining Russia in proping up Assad with its military. Lacking leadership what Obama is actually doing is playing whack-a-mole; and losing.","The history of sanctions is that they work - but only against democracies, such as South Africa. In this oblique world an iron-man ruled country harboring vast natural resources coveted by almost all of earth's nations will have the means to outlive sanctions...Not only are sanctions ineffective they have been shown to be mean spirited because they inflict most pain on the least fortunate of the targeted country, thus building bitterness and anger at all parties. Russians will come to see the US, in particular, and the West as arrogant bullies usurping their natural governance. Lest we forget these are the people who suffered a million deaths at Stalingrad rather than surrender to Hitler's army...If Obama is thus employing a wrong-headed strategy, what then to do with Putin? First, quit the verbal threats - they only raise Putin's standing and isolate and unite Russians. Then have the Western leaders engage with Putin and reluctantly accept the Crimea annexation - there's no going back. But Europe and the US should begin a crash program to free Europe from Russia's stranglehold on energy supply using our newly found supplies...Simultaneously, the West should immediately, and sans fanfare, begin to establish NATO forces into the Balkans. in other words create real 'red lines' that Putin will recognize as perilous to both Russia's economy and to any ambitions he has at recreating the Soviet Union.",,,,,,,
Frank 95,,,,"Mike and mf.By using terms such as Russian troll or Putin's toady you are not advancing your argument. On the contrary, you show that you have nothing worthwhile to say. Which part of what I said do you disagree with? Are Russians helping an anti-US government in Alaska or are Americans helping an anti-Russian government in a country that had been the birthplace of Russian culture. Are the Ukrainian insurgents fighting in Kiev, or are Ukrainian forces fighting in pro-Russian eastern parts of Ukraine. ..Mike is right to point out that America fought a civil war at great cost to safeguard the unity of the country, but that was a true civil war brought about by two ideologies inside America. There was no foreign government inciting and arming one side against another. What happened in Ukraine was a coup brought about by foreign agitators at the cost of billions, and already they are talking of admitting the new coupist government into NATO. ..Far from being a Russian troll, I support America anytime against Russia and rather than being Putin's toady I would support President Obama anytime over Putin. The point is that current interventionist policies in Ukraine and in the Middle East were manufactured by neocons and are not in America's long-term interests, as we have already seen by the mess that has been created in the Middle East and the terrorism that has emerged as the result. A new cold war that might turn hot as the result of stupidity is in no one's interest.","At a time when the Middle East is on fire and when after trillions of dollars, a million Iraqis and thousands of American forces dead, we are told that we have to return to Iraq to stem the tide of the terrorist group ISIS that poses a serious threat not only to the region but the West, the New York Times wants to aggravate the contrived hostility towards Russia. The conflict in Ukraine is as much - indeed much more - due to the narrow Western geopolitical interests as to Putin's ambitions. It is time for the West to wake up and realize that its policies in the Middle East and beyond over the past few decades have been total failures and counter-productive. ..Instead of advocating unilateralism, we need to move towards a truly multipolar and collaborative world order. This would mean asking for Russian and Chinese help instead of alienating them, and in the Middle East we must reach a comprehensive nuclear and political agreement with Iran, put pressure on the Arab sheiks to stop funding terrorists, and to pressure Israel to reach a fair and viable agreement with the Palestinians on the basis of a two-state soluton.","Yet another condescending piece based on total ignorance of Russian history and of what has been happening during the past few months in Ukraine. At a time when we need sober analysis and intelligent debate, we get yet another Putin-bushing article without any suggestion about how to get out of this mess, mainly created by neocons. Whether Putin is corrupt or not is not the main issue. For many centuries, Russia was isolated and kept out of the European family, and when she tried to modernize it was done with such violence and haste that it alienated many Russians from their history and from the West. After the collapse of communism, Russia saw the ugly face of Mafia capitalism and the oligarchs who are now enjoying their looted billions in various Western capitals. To add insult to injury, the West began to push NATO right to Russias borders. ..Like many other ill-fated Western interventions, this will backfire. If Russia and China needed any incentive to get closer together, the events in Ukraine and the use of Western economic clout to isolate and impoverish Russia will push them closer together and may ultimately undermine the Western-dominated economic system that dictates the term of international trade and banking. Instead of ratcheting up the pressure it is time for cooler heads to persuade Ukraine to take a neutral stance between Russia and the West, while having close links with both Russia and EU, at the same time getting Russia more integrated with the West.",,,,,,,
Dr.J Boost,,,,Putin has more of it than Obama who is only after political ammunition. - not truth!,Two questions:.I. Are the Dutch furious at Putin - or are they sensible and want to know the truth before judging?.II. Have the USA and NATO ever ended their Cold War?,"EU or NATO in Ukraine.I am sure neither Mr. Putin nor Mother Russia have any intention of expanding. But there have been events which forced Mr. Putins hand, as 1939 the invasion into Poland forced Britains:.What happened in Ukraine had a similar fore-play in Grusiya (Georgia)?.The regime in Tbilissi shelled and bombed regions which were not Grusiyan (but Russian) speaking to drive the populations out of their homesteads and villages. When these people begged Russia to help them, Russia did that, and they live peacefully now, protected from those bombers in Tbilissi...In Ukraine, an insurgency in Kiev (with CIA) putsched away a government, and the new regime's first decree was a ban on all non-Ukrainian languages and traditions. Like in Grusiya, people in non-Ukrainian (but Russian) speaking regions got upset and, feeling threatened, they asked for help, and voted, in majorities, for independence or, as in the Krym, re-join their original country (they had only been handed over, without any vote, to Ukraine in 1964).  ..We are, now, made to believe that all this was only a Russian expansion plot - although the truth is that, since 1990, the US strategy has been to use invites to join the EU as first steps to join NATO - i.e. push Russia more and more into a little corner which was less and less defendable. Ukraine was just a nice long bloc that would close the gap between NATO members Poland and Turkey..Let's face it: That is not in Europe's interest.","That is, again, one of these mud-slinger tacticts:.President Putin is not Vlad the Impaler (who was nor Russian either) -.Putin made clear that he does not support such penetrations (unlike other Presidents)",Why should Putin do any of these?.That is just a result of our war-mongering free press and media.,,,,,
Jay,,,,"I think that only an insane person and only in a dream can imagine that Russia would suddenly attack NATO, he told the newspaper Corriere Della Sera. I think some countries are simply taking advantage of peoples fears with regard to Russia..The same was said about Ukraine, Georgia and Crimea.  Fear is not imagined nor is the invasion by the Russians.  Mr. Putin is quite sane. It would indeed be insane to directly attack NATO. Instead Mr. Putin attacks weak links and takes great advantage of Obama's fear and hesitation.  Putin knows that Mr. Obama is afraid, if not just cowardly.  Russia's sphere of influence is increasing. Putin is becoming bolder as is China in the Pacific..At home, in America, Neville Chamberlain Obama agonizes on how to respond.  If given the opportunity Mr. Obama will negotiate another Munich and believe its a victory.  The naivete and arrogance of Mr. Obama has sealed the fate of Eastern Europe...and perhaps Western Europe too.","The troops and equipment should never have been removed by Obama in the first place.  The so-called pivot to Asia made it appear to Putin and China that America cannot stand up and face two fronts as it has done for more than 70 years. That encouraged Putin to invade Georgia, Ukraine and Crimea. It also encouraged Assad to ignore the threats of the red line.  And it encouraged China to continue its military build up and the building of sand islands more than 600 miles from the Chinese mainland..Obama created an atmosphere of fear and mistrust by our allies and an opportunity for adventurism and out-right aggression by our foes.  And it's not just Obama. The Congress shares a great deal of responsibility for weakening American power and resolve. Slashing the military's strength and budget creates power vacuums that opponents of America will exploit..There must be 2 heavy combat divisions or several heavy combat brigade teams stationed throughout Europe. Plus there must be supporting air wings and one carrier battle group with accompanying amphibious assault and support ships in the Mediterranean.  And there should be plenty of back-up..Mr. Obama believes, wrongly, that everything can be negotiated. Sometimes the only thing the other side understands is knowing that substantial American forces are just over the horizon ready to strike. Putin and China must clearly understand that America is not withdrawing from the world stage. They understand when America stands fast.","Putin has lost control of the situation.  My guess is, this is exactly what the president warned him about.","Everyone is forgetting that NATO and US had made the same demands from Russia. They were told to withdraw troops from within their own border. Putin seems to be incharge of the situation and we are playing into his hand. Its about time we stopped making threats to Russia, instead we should focus more on having Kiev talk to seperatists in the East to get a resolution.","In visiting Russia recently there were several things that struck me as a bit unnerving. First I saw few families walking or socializing or just being together. Children did not play together with their parents.  People seemed isolated. Next in traveling about on several tours the Russian version of history, particularly it's view of WWII and how the Russians won the war is very strange. Only Russia suffered and only Russia prevailed. And then, when touring museums and places of the old Russian Czars the guide would tell us how the Russians deserved to keep the art and treasure captured from Nazis as Russian troops advanced through the countries once overrun by the Nazis. The art and treasure were the Russian's just reward and payment due no matter what the country of origin because of the suffering of the Russian people at the hands of the Nazis. Last, was the paranoia that seems to pervade the Russian view of the West, NATO and the United States.  The Russians feel isolated, threatened and apart. They feel as though a great power has been demeaned and insulted and that the West must be aware that Russia is a great nation and a great people.  I wasn't looking or seeking this view of Russia. It sort of hits you when your there.  Russia feels alone, slighted and as though it must reassert it's former role as a super power.  With that view reinforced by Putin's actions there is no hope for reconciliation or accommodation and partnership with their neighbors.","Rather than Greece Should Be Wary of Mr. Putin it should rather be that the US, Germany, France, Ukraine, Greece, Russia, UK etc. etc. stop acting like children who really need to fight with each other, and instead act with wisdom and solve their common problems? The reality is that the deeper problems facing these countries are the same (notably demographic collapse), and all this useless fighting only weakens them.","Well, Thomas, it's a lot simpler to lead when you're infallible. And to criticize a Russian leader's motives when you're an American. Your article is replete with put-downs and invective...lie, under the guise of, kleptocracy, brute force, ad infinitum. While America is trying to strengthen the world, Putin is trying to tear it apart. As for the West has no intention of bringing Ukraine into NATO, you're kidding, right?","I am just stunned! Mr. Putin and Company have controlling interest in American uranium and exports are being made to Canada without an export license as did 25 more that was sent to Western Europe..There is something very, very wrong and far beyond the participation of the Clintons..American national security is at great risk..The Times must continue to investigate the matter and these deals and acquisitions must be reversed as soon as possible. Not even an ounce of uranium should leave this country without an export license and strict review of it's purpose and final destination.  Every part of these transactions must be made public so that American nation security is protected..If necessary the United States should act to seize everything and halt any further exports.","This will not be the last Bloody Retreat.  Mr. Putin will finish of Ukraine and then set his sights on his next goal.  The next buffer zone that New Soviets will require to keep NATO at distance may well be Poland or Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  Each success emboldens Mr. Putin.  Crimea and Georgia were testing grounds.  The New Soviets are building and improving their armed forces.  They are testing cruise missiles prohibited by treaties. And they continue their unabashed support of Assad and North Korea.  The New Soviet are also adding new ships to their fleet including new nuclear submarines.  Fortunately they will not be getting the new amphibious assault ships built by France..In the face of all of this the American army is being reduced by 80,000 personnel and the loss of more heavy combat brigades including reductions of those brigades in Europe.  The New Soviets see a retreating, recalcitrant and fearful American president who cannot make a decision.  They also see opportunity to exploit Mr. Obama's weakness.  And they will continue to do so.","The terrorists, with Russias support, are attempting to destroy the evidence of this international crime. We urge the international community to oblige Russia to withdraw its terrorists from Ukraine and to allow the Ukrainian and international experts to hold a comprehensive investigation of the tragedy,.And Mr. Obama does nothing! He doesn't speak out. He doesn't mobilize international support. He doesn't impose sanctions that are meaningful. And, he moves American combat brigades, air and naval power from Europe and the Mediterranean. Not to forget the red lines that he paints with a magic marker..It is no wonder that the Russians, Mr. Putin and now the Ukraine separatists have little regard for anything that Mr. Obama may say.  Putin loathes Mr. Obama and has no respect, least of all fear of even the least of sanctions..So with Mr. Obama's impotence and America's world leadership challenged at every turn, hundreds of innocent civilians, 154 of them from the Netherlands, (an American ally), lie dead, naked, crushed, burned and dismembered as America stands down..And people ask why the Ukrainian separatists and Russia act without regard for world opinion least of all regard for human life..A real American President would have had a high-level response and recovery team on it's way immediately and advised the Russians to cooperate as well as remove the Ukrainian separatists from the crash site."
Sally DeCapite,,,,"I don't remember reading or hearing about they'd US threatening missiles on Russia's' borders.  If we did, it must have been after Putin went into the Ukraine.  Why don't the separatists just move to Russia.  I'm sure Russia will welcome them with open arms.  That would cost these folks careers and some money, but let them choose  what is truly important to them.","I keep saying the same thing.  Putin can't get over being the shortest guy in the room.  Look at the silly pictures he took, all of them trying to prove how masculine he is, as if height had anything to do with being masculine!","I read somewhere that Russia had a different vision of what is happenIng.  I would say that is true but to me it means that Russia's vision is blinded FROM the truth because of Putin's arrogance.  I certainly can't speak for the Russian people, but I am old enough to remember their bravery and also the horror they went through during WWII.  Is that what Putin wants (and some of his counter parts in this country?).",,,,,,,
Two Can Sam,,,,"I can definitely see the US assisting Ukraine in countering Russia via proxy, much similar to our assistance during the Soviet invasionoccupation of Afghanistan and other communist uprisings across the globe...And if things get really out of hand, I also can see a direct involvement with American GI's coming to the rescue.  Especially in a little over 16 months, when the next US president takes office, which will probably be a Republican.  Either way, because of Putin's aggressions, you will see a strong anti-Kremlin stance in our national politics for many years to come.","Trade pacts and EU membership aspirations should not irritate or threaten Russia.  I'm sure Putin's smug pride is smarting (and rightfully so) but there will be plenty of opportunities for Russian business after all of the egotism is put in check.  In fact, once Ukrainian's economy is healthy there will be more opportunities for Russia - if they don't 'toss the baby with the bath water'. ..The scene has been real quite about any Ukrainian NATO aspirations, which is what Russia fears most.  ..I think we should approach Russia to join NATO, we have been on the same side of the two big wars and we have long cooperated on the space frontier, even when we were supposedly bitter enemies...We could accomplish much if we embraced Russia and treated them as a trusted partner, setting aside any petty jealousies on both sides...Of course, this would require an equal commitment from Russia, but they would finally have the respect they desire and everyone would gain the strength and security such an alliance would provide...Who is courageous enough to step up first?",,,,,,,,

Mr. Cohen, you are not saying any.thing unique to Russia.When it comes to using force.it is O.K., even noble, when used by America but.horrific when used but horrific when used by other.nations.",President Obama has better instincts he should  follow. to meet with Putin. May be Putin wants to be helpful in.resolving Syrian crisis as he was on Iran and destruction.of the chemicals. If he has nothing concrete to offer.an hour of Obama's time is lost. Conferring prestige.on Puting by such meeting is nonsense. Obama will.be better off to ignore nonsensical advice.,"As all these comments involve reading the.mind of Putin and explaining his motives, my.reading of this rorschach test is that Putin wants.consitutional change to give mximum autonomy.to the provinces. The centralized government.in Kiev is anti-Russian. with no change Ukraine.will be closely aligned with EU. If the change is made.Eatern Ukraine will be closer to Russia. This is.what Russia wants. Kieve, USA and Europe are.not inclined to oblidge Russia. The standoff.will continue.","Every leader reflects the society and the yearnings of the.people. Putin, though a demon in America, has 85 approval.rating in Russia. That is all he cares about. When even democrat.candidates are hesitant to be associated with Obama as today's.editorial shows, Putin can't be expected to listen to Obama.respectfully. Putin is orthodox and unlikely to hold Pope Francis.as his role model. Shooting down Malaysian airline, horrible as.it was, doesn't make Puting a demon. He is ulikely to have ordered it.and We also shot down Iranian airline from USS Vicente. What does.that incident make us?","Putin is following your logic. If Ukraine and Europe.view Russia as a threat, Russia also view Europe.and USA as threat if they expand into Ukraine..It is the same logic that compelled president JFK to.confront Khruschev to remove the nukes from.Cuba. All countries have right to protect their.security. If west can recognize the legitimate.security interest of Russia, the problem can be.solved.","The most puzzling and disappointing is the western.response to Kiev government tactics in this conflict a la.Bashar El Assad.Kiev forces are using artillary and tanks.for indiscriminate shelling and killing civilians, their own.citizens, and  destrying property. Yes, civilians are without.food and water and some cases electricity. No western government has criticized Kiev heavy handedness and.civilian casualties. Opposition to Russian intervention is.proper but they should have restrained Kiev govt..Rather than raising objections to Russian huminitarian aid.west and Ukraine could offer their own aid or ask Russia.to check the trucks. Escalation is inevtiable. Having come so far in intervention, Putin won't let Kiev to defeat the rebels and brutalize them after the victory.",Good to have another perspective on Ukrainian situation..Russian preference for stability is understandable due to.the chaos of sudden collapse of the Soviet Union. The reports.of those days had many stories of Russians beggin on the streets.and pensioners struggling with the basic neccessities on the.limited income eroded by the inflation. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin.got the blame for the chaos creating an yearning for a strong.leader. Putin filled the role of strong leader who brought stability.and prosperity. Western media errs portraying Putin as an.autocrat without the context of the situation after 1991. A.strong and decisive leader would always seem autocratic but.will be preferred to a weak one in the face of chaos..No wonder Putin has 68 approval rating while Obama has 41..It would have been more prudent for Putin to wait for the new.elections in May and new policy with regard to Russia and the west..It would have been more justifiable to send Russian troops if new govt. threatened Russian interests.,"The analysis of Putin's Russia is on the mark. Hopefully, USA.and Europe will implement the suggestions outlined here..Some like energy independence from Russia are for the long term..Many Eastern European countries are 100 dependent on.Russian energy. There is no quick fix. As the west takes steps.to strengthen the border states, it should make it clear that.mistreatment of Russian speaking minorities will not be.acceptable. This is one mistake west made with the new govt..in Kiev which moved with amazing speed to de-legitimize Russian.language creating fear of what other discriminatory measures.Kiev government will take. This will fuel Russian nationalism and.approval of Putin's actions he might take. Hopefully the democratic.reform will include equal rights for Russian minorities in not only.Ukraine but Baltic states, Moldova,etc.","Ratcheting up won't serve Ukrainians very well. Peace through.negotiations is a better alternative. Fact remains that Ukraine.is made  up of two nations and there is not much sense of unity..When Scotland is poised to become an independent country.and Catalan part of Spain may take the same route, separatism.in Donbass doesn't seem so odd. Kieve did let Russian speaking.people know that their language will be banned. As goes the language,.so goes the culture and identity. Freedland of all the people should know.better the separatist sentiment in French speaking Quebec.That means.primacy of Ukrainian language and culture and probably inadequate  representation of Easterners in government services. Putin wasn't needed.to arouse Eatern Russian speaking people to take up arms. Ukrainian army's response was also harsh as the reports of indiscriminate firing at the residential  areas suggest which further unflamed the people to join..We got so hung up on demonizing Putin a la Saddam Hussein and.Asssaad that we totally excused wrong decisions by Ukrainian government.and the Kiev based militias.Frankly after the false propaganda.on WMDS, Iraq's cruelty in Kuwait( Kuwaiti ambassador's daughter.weepingly narrating it as scripted by PR firm Knowles and Hills).and even the noise about Russian aid trucks carrying soldiers created credibility gap to accept the narrative emerging from Washington and.Ottawa.",Rasmussen and Barrossa reflect NATO thinking..In a situation of Donetsk under siege NATO would.have attacked the government forces and calimed.it loudly as huminatarian aid. Tony Blair justified.western intervention on humanitarian ground. Russia.is using NATO playbook. Diplomatic isolation of Russia.is hilarious.

JT FLORIDA,,,,"Ease back on the hostile, political rhetoric, Tom. Using descriptives like Putin the Thug and  Czar Putin is something like what you used to beat the war drum against Sadaam Hussein in the lead up to the disaster in Iraq.","Miscalculation has been a threat since the Cold War but it should be noted that since the fall of the Soviet Union there has been a narrative that somehow the West 'won' the Cold War. This narrative feeds the ultra nationalist in Russia while conjuring up the age- old fears they have maintained for over a century regarding encirclement...It is time for everyone to take a step back and I think NATO and the West need to make the first move in reaching out to Russia. But at the same time, western analysts need to deeply assess the stability of Putin to determine if he is rational or if this is a ruse to fool the West on Ukraine and the Baltics...This is no time for cowboy politics in the United States and elsewhere.",Putin just blinked. Obama just won. The sanctions worked and we're fortunate to have President Obama at the helm of our country: steely cool in a crisis and knowing the right course of action.,"This is a good commentary although it's difficult to see any American politician along with most European ones following it. ..They will not follow this advice because of elections in the U.S. both this year and in 2016. Depending where the election is being contested, candidates will either start chest-thumping such as Lindsey Graham or trying to advocate lesser confrontation without really locating a.solution to the aggressiveness of Putin..In Europe, they want natural gas and trade; two areas where the U.S. has little to do with Russia...The real question though is to move ahead and figure where Putin is going with his foreign policy now that he is enjoying great popularity in Russia. If he is 'delusional' as Angela Merkel is said to have argued, what's next and what type of response is calibrated to be effective?","Our revolution is different. Tom, are these the same Ukrainians telling you a few weeks ago that they would quickly and easily defeat Russian forces if they tried to take control? That rhetoric was full of naive, empty promises...You never really define a role of the West, including the United States in this response to Putin and therein lies the real challenge ahead; being precise in formulating policies.","I think you have it right about Putin but you're giving no credit to an emerging and brilliant response by President Obama to allow Putin to wallow in this folly, much like the USSR did in that graveyard of empires, Afghanistan a generation ago...Obama has the mature foreign policy with regard to Syria even if GOP candidates gang up and call him weak in dealing with Putin. The problem for those opponents is that bellicosity will have the exact opposite effect with voters, even in red states and by the time 2016 rolls around, Russia will be trying to extricate itself from the quagmire in Syria.","This is a wise course of action and once again demonstrates the leadership of President Obama. Rather than leading from behind as his critics have charged, the president calculated the only sane policy to deter Putin's nationalism...Now it shows signs of working and this comes at a time when Europeans are reluctant to support sanctions. once again, President Obama threads the needle between doing nothing as some Europeans would want and the bellicose statements by the likes of John McCain and Lindsey Graham.","The point is that President Obama acted unlike the Bush administration which largely stayed silent when Putin invaded Georgia. ..In the case of the Europeans, President Obama has been able to convince them, despite their reliance on Russian oil and other contracts, that they share common interests in limiting Putin's nationalism. He has been able to do it with a persuasive appeal to mutual interests. That's the mark of a statesman.","You are too vague and lack specifics as to what steps should be taken by the West to respond in a credible way to effectively end this crisis. For example, what if Putin is indeed irrational and sees no end to his moves westward? how can the U.S. Respond with military assistance with high probability that things will not escalate into a larger conflict...We know in the United States how propaganda and false claims can lead to large scale wars, Vietnam and Iraq being major examples...What is the precise end game for the policies that you propose?",I agree with you on several points but the real point of all this is the cool that President Obama demonstrates in a crisis. Angela Merkel called Putin 'delusional' and it reminded me of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when Kennedy confronted Khruschev that nearly launched the world into nuclear war...President Obama is the right person at the right time to deal with this crisis because he calculates his response without resorting to chest thumping like the republicans do in a crisis.
lb,,,,"What an arrogant piece of steam-blowing! The first part of this analysis is correct. Between Putin and Ukranian ultra-nationalists, Putin is definitely the more calculating and level-headed, but that's a pretty low bar :) But Mr. Pukhov is grossly underestimating the sophistication of the other political players. The scenario that he unfolds in the second part of his op-ed (with Tymoshenko returning to power) is obvious to any school child. As the leaked telephone conversation between Estonia's Premier and Catherine Ashton shows, everyone is quite aware of the danger of returning to business as usual, and the new government's first order of business will be to gain legitimacy in the entire country. As far as Russia's de facto annexation of the Crimea, the game can be played by both sides. With more autonomy, the people in the Crimea can lose out on the support provided by EC to the rest of Ukraine and may eventually voluntarily want to distance themselves from Russia. In the long run, that's the only constructive strategy the Ukranian government can undertake. Otherwise, Russia will stage this show everywhere from Donetsk to Kharkiv to Odessa and all the way to Transdnistria. The carrot is much more effective than the stick, and if Kiev doesn't know that yet, I am sure there will be enough European advisers there to convince them.","What an arrogant piece of steam-blowing!

And jettisoning the Eastern provinces to Russia to wallow in the squalor of freedom, Russian style.  Diplomats need to stop issuing rote, meaningless statements about reducing tension and start working on a solution that splits the country apart.  ..Ukraine can be a very successful Western oriented country with strong democratic institutions pointed firmly toward the west like Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.  The Eastern regions can become the Russian Rust Belt and bitterly complain in 10 years when Putin has done little to nothing for them. ..Let's move on and start solving the crisis with actual, real decisions instead of these meaningless phone calls that are allowing a militant separatist movement to take hold and destabilize all of Ukraine.",The US sanctions make no sense.  I suppose Putin could retaliate by targeting fat-cat cronies of the Obama administration.,"Putin is right on several counts, most importantly, Crimea was handed to the Ukraine region in the 1950s as an administrative decision within the USSR.  Russia has very legitimate claims on Crimea and the Crimean people themselves have just overwhelmingly endorsed those claims...No worries though,shovel ready Biden has been dispatched to resolve the situation.","Vladimir Putin has been around the block for a long time.  I recently listened to Hunt for Red October and heard his name mentioned.  Even years ago he was a known power player.  The style of his recent work does little for his well meaning Russian citizens.  V. Putin is someone who cannot be trusted and as such casts a veil over all the good citizens of his country.  Why am I not surprised? Just look at his behavior, his attitude convey in his personal photos.  If he or his county's actions were defendable, they wouldn't have to be hidden would they?","Remember that time when Putin mocked Western sanctions with his crony buddies and laughed about the effect they'd have. Oh, well. Guess it turns out that it's some kind of attempt to destroy Mother Russia. He's so pathetic. Which is it, Vlad? Are Western sanctions jokey silly and pointless efforts to bring down the strong bare-chested Roh-see-ya?  Or, could it be that you are pouting and complaining, weirdly, that you are being attacked by foreign powers because they refuse to do business with you?  ..If Putin was nostalgic for Soviet times, he's about to revisit life circa 1985. Well done you clown.",Putin is doing in Eastern Europe what the US did in the Middle East with the Arab Spring..Same playbook.,"Putin sees a diminished America lead by a weak, indecisive and incompetent president.  He wouldn't have dared to do this if Reagan was in office.",No issue. You keep tightening the vice inch by inch. Putin will run out land claims before the West runs out of people to pressure. That's what the hysterical media don't get.,Wow.  What's next?

Anton Yakovlev,,,,"Ukrainian government had a lot of chances to settle down the conflict peacefully. Back when there were bloodless captures of government buildings, flag waving, referendums and other naive attempts to get attention..But TurchinovYatsenyuk and now Poroshenko chose open war. They are basically forcing Putin to aid rebels. If Putin leaves rebels to their fate (which is grim, as ukrainian army outnumbers them by about 7 to 1, and has heavy artillery and air force), he will lose face. Dramatically. And if he supports rebels, Russia may lose everything it gained economy-wise... Lose-lose situation for Russia and Russians in Ukraine. And win-win for USEUNATO. And you say that Russia started it?..Gosh, the very first thing TurchinovYatsenyukPoroshenko should have done was giving russian language the official status. It is de-facto most used language in half the country. All those Ukrainization attempts just failed. I live in Crimea now. I visited it frequently when it was ukrainian. Street ads, signboards, etc. were all in Ukrainian. Even movies in cinemas were in Ukrainian. All official documents had to be filled in Ukrainian to be legal. All that in a region, where literally nobody speaks Ukrainian in daily life. That is... Frustrating..Had they given Russian language higher status, there would be no Crimea loss, no rebellion, no nothing. Putin's propaganda would be totally disarmed in a single move. But they did absolutely the opposite thing. Why? You answer.","But the plan drew a swift and heated response from other Russia experts in Washington, who complained that it was drawn up without Ukrainian participation and would reward Mr. Putin for aggression. ..1. It is drawn up without the rebels either..2. It is drawn up without Ukraine, because Ukraine has already demonstrated its vision of solution. Continuation of civil war until the full victory by govt troops, trial and life-long prison sentence for all survived rebels, Ukraine joining NATO and EU with NATO military bases on Russia's border..We must be realistic. Russia will not allow it no matter the cost...3. Even the idea that Donetsk and Lugansk will stay in Ukraine meets stiff resistance among rebels. But they didn't have power to resist ukrainian army's bloody assault without more help from Russia, so it looks like they had to remove key leaders of war party  (Strelkov, Bolotov) from power in exchange for Russian help. So now their peace party participates in the dialogue. And even seems to agree to some form of confederation with Ukraine. And it is actually quite an accomplishment by Russia. Done with both carrot (more war aid) and stick (forced removal of warmongers, agreeing to talks). But Poroshenko and US refuse to agree to any solution other that Ukraine's bloody one...So it looks like 24-point plan is not rewading Putin for aggression. It is the only real sensible solution besides Ukrainian kill them all with NATO aid and Putin's take Kiev in 2 weeks.","Lou,.Oh God... Is it what you are told by western mass media?...1. Orthodox church has no authority in Russia. Almost zero influence. They may look influential from outside Russia, but that is just an illusion..2. Social reformers are not demonized in Russia. But some heavily pro-western reformers (thieves of grandest scale in fact) are really hated for what they've done with Russia in early 90s. So now people are just afraid that the next pro-western social reformers would be like Yeltsin, Gaidar, Chubays etc. And the West supported those guys so heavily, that now people seem to blame the West for the situation in Russia on 90s. It does actually lookvlike they've sold Russia to the West. Putin now looks like the lesser evil than pro-western social reforms Cubays-style..3. Gays are not denonized in Russia. They are subject of jokes, sure. And they are not considered normal. And there are sone who do aggressively hate them. But there is no total hatred..But gay propaganda is hated.  Parades, public shows, political movements for gay rights, Eurovision, where Conchita Sausage wins just because heshe is gay etc. That is hated..4. Democrats, real ones, are not hated at all. The problem is: there are none. All proved to be liars and thieves. Who is to blame for that? Putin's KGB-like security and corrupt state system? Or the nature of a russian man, who always becomes a thief when he comes to power?","Putin did not dictate the fate of Ukraine without their input. Maidan thugs made a huge input into country's division by igniting nationalism both in the east and west. Blaming PutinRussia alone for that is definitely not fair. Both Russia and EUUS did their part..Toppling Yanukovich after he agreed to reforms and early election was plain stupid. That made Crimea and Ukraine's south-east believe, that maidan won't stop and Russia is their last chance. They felt betrayed by Yanukovich (yet another cleptocrat) during his rule, but with his escape they didn't feel relieved, they felt betrayed twice..And it was Yeltsin, who tried to solve Chechnya problem with leveling Grozny. It was unwise and useless. There were years of chechen de facto independence after russian loss in Yeltsin's first chechen war. Putin used another concept: divide and conquer. He made chechens fight each other. And then, after military victory, he pumped a lot of money to Chechnya. Now putin is very popular there. And chechen rebels now prefer to make their hideouts in the neighbouring regions, like Dagestan. In Chechnya they are very unpopular. Did you miss the fact that thousands of chechens now fight for Russia? Check the history of OssetiaAbkhazia war..And your analogies with Sudetenland and WW2 are totally wrong. Sudetenland was not the reason or origin of WW2. Treaty of Versailles was. Arrogance of Entente was. Western allies did everything to promote nazi revanchism in Germany. Wanna repeat that?",,,,,,

No matter what he does, he will always be a little man.","Dictators like Putin don't have to and  never justify anything to anybody...they do what they want to do, right or wrong, until either they choose to change, die or are overthrown.","Russia has already responded. According to Putin's earlier statements Russia was moving its military hardware to its borders of the most vulnerable eastern European nations.  In Estonia they even kidnapped an Estonian man from and in Estonia.  Putin has already threatened to move nuclear weapons along its Eastern European borders, as well. ..Further, Russia has flown its military jets adjacent to our east and west US coasts to harass us here, without using transponders, contrary to international rules. Again, Russia, without transponders, has harassed military and non-military jets flying in European international air space. And either Russia, or its Ukrainian surrogates, shot down in cold blood, the civilian plane with an imported Russian missile system, Russians themselves brought into Ukraine, killing everyone aboard, yet to this day, denying same... Putin started all of this in Georgia, and Crimea in Ukraine. He will not stop unless his moves are countered. We may not have been told all that we may have ascertained that Putin has already done. Based upon Obama's prior actions, it is doubtful that all of our actions are being done solely without cause.","Read Pavlo's comments from Kiev.  Also, the deposed President had just completed building himself a huge palace, and his corrupt crony oligarchs were looting Ukraine, when the people threw them out.  ..Concededly, Ukraine is within Russia's sphere of influence.  All of those countries after each war over the last few hundred years became fiefdoms of the prevailing country, until the next war.  ..Look at what Putin did to Georgia when it tried to implement democracy. The Georgian Russian provinces there are languishing, despite Putin's takeover, and he has not sent them the aid as promised, other than to leave Russian military there. Inside Estonia, Putin kidnapped an Estonian agent, allegedly spying on and in Russia.  And he has his eye on the other Baltic Republics, who are attempting to succeed with their freedom. In Moldova, Putin is inciting problems there, which may be next on his list... He has become a dictator, using Hitlerian tactics to expand his insatiable power grasp, under the guise of nationalism. The average Russian remains impoverished despite his rise to power. .. Watch Frontline's program on Putin's rise to power, which details his corruption as a deputy mayor et seq., his KGB background, his oligarch cronies' rise, and the final scene, which Putin remembers as a poor youth, living in a one room apartment with his parents: When a rat in that apartment was cornered, it attacked back. Maybe, he still has the chance to recant and change.","Putin is nothing but a dictatorial animal, who has no respect for anyone other than those who act like himself.  He does not believe in the sanctity of borders of other countries, unless they agree to be his subservient lackeys. In addition to the incursion he has just sponsored and participated in at Debaltseve, with both confirmed Russian troops and weapons, he trumpets his disrespect for the rest of Europe to peaceably resolve the Ukraine matter. As long as Europe continues to turn the other cheek, Putin's sordid escapades as a Hitlerian provocateur, will continue, until all of the former Soviet satellites who oppose his advances, fall again into his orbit. If nothing else, the Ukraine needs weapons to counter his advances, and severe sanctions need to be implemented against Russia. Precluding visas for a few of his cronies just won't cut it.","The Separatists are purely terrorists.  Any evidence obscured or destroyed, should be assumed to be done as a cover up and  they should be prosecuted as criminal actions.  How are they any different than Putin's Chechens that he deems terrorists that he  prosecutes.  Putin is vicariously responsible and liable, and it is time for the world to sanction him, and set him apart as a pariah.","Putin's attitude and behavior is both that of a neo-Nazi and Communist dictator rolled into one like Hitler before and during WW II, and Stalin immediately thereafter, who will not honor the sanctity of sovereign borders. This is a more brazen attempt than that which he did in Georgia.  He saw he could get away with lesser intrusion then, and has increased his bellicose actions in and against Ukraine now. Eastern Europe will be next. Europe's watching without equivalent opposition in any form, is like watching Rome burning. If it refuses to act as the primary respondent, Europe deserves what will happen to it without our aid. This is Cold War II, and will not end any time soon.","Well, now despite his denials and his anti-Hitlerian right-winged diatribes, Putin has assumed Hitler's mantle, and his Russian troops are attacking just like the Nazis did in Europe.  The issue becomes, what will the rest of Europe do, since Putin, brazen and unopposed, just as Hitler, will not stop there.",Putin's actions are looking more and more like a dictator's actions like Stalin's actions at the end of WWII.

He stands there flatfooted by Putin again, this time over the alliance against ISIS the US has rather pointedly been left out of.

Putin of Russia and only reluctantly taken a phone call, freezing out the Kremlin leader over his intervention in Ukraine in their own personal cold war...This is one of the times's newest techniques.  It takes a malignant action by someone it likes, Obama, and makes it a mutual hatred.  There is no evidence that President Putin is participating in any cold war. The times did something similar for its pet Chinese artist, Way Way, describing him and China as torturing each other, thus enlarging Mr. Way Way considerably.","Why do you assume that there are no volunteers who agree with Russian foreign policy?  I mean, I see the reasons for what they've done in Ukraine. They can't tolerate certain things on their border any more than we could tolerate bombs being tossed over from Canada. Presumably given Putin's 85 percent approval ratings, some Russians also agree.","Putin can most certainly win in Syria. All he has to do is kill most, if not all, of the radical muslims opposing the Assad regime...I'm OK with that.  Stabilize the country, shore up the borders, get things moving on rebuilding, the US will be there in no time lest the Germans get all the contracts.

Obama said he took us out of war in Iraq, and now we are right back in there.  Despite what the neocons say, I don't actually consider that a good thing.  If Putin thinks he can clean things up without cost to the US taxpayer, let him do so.","Why do you assume that there are no volunteers who agree with Russian foreign policy?  I mean, I see the reasons for what they've done in Ukraine. They can't tolerate certain things on their border any more than we could tolerate bombs being tossed over from Canada. Presumably given Putin's 85 percent approval ratings, some Russians also agree.","Putin can most certainly win in Syria. All he has to do is kill most, if not all, of the radical muslims opposing the Assad regime...I'm OK with that.

George Hoffman,,,,"Putin has been able to exploit the crisis in Ukraine because the United States has made so many military blunders since the 911 attacks. We are are victims of our own friendly fire. Putin knows is why we are seen so weakour on the whole stage. But Americans rejected limited air strikes against the Assad regime in the opinion polls prior to Obama's ploy to get approval for them in the Senate. They have had it with using our military as a blunt instrument in foreign policy even though Cohen continues to beat his little tin drum, which is getting rather boring in its repetitiveness. George Kennan, the author of our containment policy against the old Soviet Union, warned of a new Cold War when the Senate voted in May, 1998, to expand NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. If we had stopped the expansion of NATO with the Baltic states, it might have been s different story. But Russia rightfully feels threatened by the NATO expansion.  And we need Russia's influence to seal a deal with Iran over the stalemate in our negotiations, because with only the limited resources of a volunteer armed forces, badlly battered by two inconclusive wars, we just don't have the option of another potential war in the region. If Cohen were sincere in his resolve to stand up to Russia, he would be writing an op-ed about brining back the draft for all eligible young men and women in our country. It would sent a clear message to Putin about our resolve. I doubt Cohen will do that.","There's no one on the horizon that has the stature of George Kennan. He was a renaissance man, spoke fluent Russian, love Russian literature, wrote poetry, played guitar and still had the time to conceive of the containment theory in his long telegram that was used as the paradigm in our Cold War against the old Soviet Union. We are surrounded by mental midgets now in this country next to the long shadow Kennan casts over the historical landscape. He's one of my intellectual heroes. ..By the way Putin really doesn't even need to be a chess player given how mediocre the competition really is in this country. But I liked your analogy to a hockey player, who loves to play the game down and dirty. It's realpolitik on ice skates. And he plays it so well.","Putin is a pragmatic nationalist, amoral and cold-blooded, from the school of thought that is called realpolitik. His trope about the break-up of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century is more of a cynical nod to domestic politics than a deeply felt belief. He just has an intuitive and uncanny sixth sense to smell weakness in his prey, which is the hallmark of all first-class predators, on the world stage we call foreign affairs. And so he choose his battles very carefully as when he had a major PR coup and played Kerry and Obama so astutely in averting an intervention in the Syrian civil war. They came off as rank amateurs. And Putin even got an editorial in the NYT as frosting on the cake for his efforts..Obama is shooting blanks, and Putin knows it. But George W. Bush was also shooting blanks, and Putin knew it way back then, if any one really cares to remember, when America naively marched off to war in Iraq as if it was an away game on the high school football schedule. Is that Putin's fault? I don't think so..Our weakness stems more from the fact that we are victims of our own friendly fire in the long war on terror. Putin merely exploited it. He knew  that Americans had an epiphany of Biblical proportions on the road to Damascus. And he won that battle as he seems to be in this crisis in the Ukraine..He really isn't a great poker player. But he doesn't have to be given the mediocre competition here in America.","As a fellow Vietnam veteran, though I was only a medical corpsman, I find the bellicose and myopic opinions Senator John McCain expressing in this op-ed to be almost being delusional. Of course, the American will to exercise its power on the world stage has been weakened because of the foreign policy debacles committed during the long war on terror. But these blunders have been prosecuted under  two administrations, former President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. President Putin knows how war-weary the American people are and used that when he played his cards so well against Secretary of State John Kerry and President Obama when the president was rebuffed by the Senate to vote for an intervention in the Syrian civil war. And I distinctly recall Sen. McCain's reaction to this event. He said that during his entire career as a politician he had never seen anything like this, which just demonstrates how out of touch he really is with the mood of the American people. And quite frankly, I am getting bored with his hawkish demeanor in the press. He's become such an embarrassment to me when he is always beating little tin drum in the MSM as he did before In the pages of TNR for an intervention in the Syrian civil war. Rattling his sabers here unfortunately confirms my belief that he should seriously consider retirement as a public service to all of us. He seems to be trapped in the past as so many aging Vietnam veterans are.",,,,,,
Reva,,,,They are definitely NOT the same -- all the Americans fooled by Putin are the same  people who think Republicans care about anyone but the wealthy.,"Dear Mr. Pollack:..You act as though you had irrefutable sources and knew the truth.  ..The truth is, none of us know the truth.  But for someone charging anti-Semitism to take the side of Putin is - naive. I don't think you can argue that Mr. Putin is a dictator who punishes those who stand up to him, whether rock singers or journalists or protesters or members of the Russian 1.   Just today Mr. Putin admitted he staged the entire coup of Crimea.  ..The New York Times (as all media) is indeed slanted -- but not hopeless, as you imply.","Alex: if you 're so sure of the rightness and honesty of Putin's actions, why do you and your other Russian friends keep trying to persuade us? Must be frustrating. We in the U.S. can make up our own minds, we don't need the Tokyo Rose tactics-which by the way failed, Japan lost.","A hawk's interpretation of things.  The problem with the CIA is that it has a history of interfering with and often assassinating the leaders of foreign governments, which has in many cases led to the current brutal regimes, as in Iran.  And the only way our military will win battles nowadays is with nuclear weapons - is that what you suggest? The Middle East wars are very complicated, with many different factions, and we shouldn't always be interfering in countries that are not attacking us.  Iraq was a complete failure.  Also, I don't agree that the U.S. is looked on as impotent.  Putin may bluster, but not the five nations we've just cooperated with on the Iran deal.  Our President is looked on with respect in many quarters because he doesn't rush to attack, he thinks first and also tries diplomacy.  And when he does attack, it's targeted and often achieves the goal, as with Osama bin Laden and in Libya, in concert with NATO, stopping Qaddafi from gassing his citizens.","We don't know the the truth of any of this situation.  The accusations have so been thrown back and forth, that it sounds like the Russian and Ukrainian factions are making it up as they go along...My strongest feeling is that Putin is orchestrating the entire thing, fomenting turmoil of many kinds in Ukraine, to throw the U.S. and EU off base, so that they're not really sure to who to support.  Meanwhile, he feels they will look foolish and wrong in the process and he looks like the good guy, sincerely looking for a solution...Putin's Achilles heel, however, is the economy, and that's where we should hit back.  He's using military action to divert people's attention from the failing economic conditions, a la Germany in the 1930's, and the media could do its biggest service here by exposing as much as possible about current conditions in that area.  It is also time cut down on purchases of Russian gas and oil.","I am suspicious that this is just a way for Putin not to honor any agreement:  I wanted to, but the militants inside the country didn't, so what could we do? Don't tell me Mr. Pushilin isn't talking to Mr. Putin.   There is such a web of lies and half-truths in this whole situation, including a lack of knowledge by the U.S. about what is what, that at this point, probably anything that keeps any peace or at least stops the killing until the next election in Kiev is a good solution.","Yes, when the Russian oligarchs (who have usually amassed their fortunes illegally) offend Putin, he simply imprisons them -- it's for his own interests, not for the good of his people.  Putin can do this because he himself controls the political process and the media.  By contrast, the Kochs, for all their money, spent 175 million in the last election and none of their candidates won.  If more people would participate in the 2014 election and give even small donations, the oligarchs would still lose.","Putin is totally playing politics here.  His current gambit is to make the U.S. look foolish by calling a halt to sanctions.  President Obama is right to do as he's done, and not be fooled. I wonder what the Republican comeback to this will be -- those who have consistently urged major sanctions.  We will see what Putin's next move will be, it must be totally watched.  The problem is not really Crimea, it's what's next.","Mr. Putin conveniently forgets the struggles of the Soviet Jewish community to emigrate during the 1960's and 70's due to the repression of the Russian government.  He also forgets the Jewish-targeted purges by Stalin, and the herding of the Russian Jewish community into Ukraine in the 18th and 19th centuries by Russian Tsars, setting up a conveniently massed target for pogroms in the 20th century.  ..There certainly is anti-Semitism in Ukraine (attested to by cousins of mine there, who left for Israel 20 years ago) and in the Ukrainian community in the U.S. But to paint Russia as innocent of it is a complete lie, and no one is fooled.",
judgeroybean,,,,Let Putin do whatever he wants in Syria.  Let him waste Russian lives and treasure.  It will prove his undoing.,"Let Putin send troops, equipment and St. Basil's Cathedral to Syria.  The result will be worse, for Russia, than our incursion into Iraq.  Syria may be the final nail in Putin's coffin.  If anything, Obama should encourage him in his adventure into the morass.","But what if Putin gives also known as ISIL the ultimatum Obama should have?.And what ultimatum would that be?  There is NO solution to this Middle East chaos.  Let Putin give this magical ultimatum.  Let Putin own ISIL, and take them home with him.","To me, Putin just acts like a Republican with his own country.","Admitting the Ukraine into NATO would certainly be provocative.  While we're at it, we should have some stealth fighters buzz the Kremlin while it's in session.  When your enemy is bent on jumping into quicksand, why throw him a rope?  This action in the Crimea will do more harm to Putin and Russia than anything we could hope to achieve.  That balloon you heard popping is the fifty billion spent on showcasing the New Russia at the Sochi Olympics.  With more to come.","I hope to God, since we a country that over-reacts to everything, that we do not listen to the John McCain's and Lindsey Graham's and lift one finger to intervene in Russia's adventurism in Syria and the Middle East.  There is no doubt that the situation in Syria is a humanitarian disaster, but it is a situation that defies a solution.  Let Putin have his day.  He will end up being hoisted on his own petard.","The solution is to carry through with Putin's worst fear; admit Ukraine to N.A.T.O.  Would that be an act of war?  Isn't invading a sovereign nation an act of war?  Didn't we learn a thing from Neville Chamberlain's proclamation of peace in our time?  Providing weapons to the Ukraine will do no good.  Provide them with a trained army.  Tip-toeing around a man such as Putin encourages him to behave more brazenly.  Face him down now, or face him down later.  There is no other choice.","Nonsense, Russia will take half of Ukraine at the very least if NATO grants Ukraine membership..N.A.T.O. forces would demonstrate that Putin's Russia is a just a third-rate power.   Technology has changed the dynamic.  Russia can't even make a functioning toaster.  Tanks are yesterday's weapons.","I hope to God, since we a country that over-reacts to everything, that we do not listen to the John McCain's and Lindsey Graham's and lift one finger to intervene in Russia's adventurism in Syria and the Middle East.  There is no doubt that the situation in Syria is a humanitarian disaster, but it is a situation that defies a solution.  Let Putin have his day.  He will end up being hoisted on his own petard.","Don't send arms to the Ukraine.  The training required on sophisticated weapons would be daunting.  Make a move as bold as Putin's; admit Ukraine into N.A.T.O.  This scenario is exactly the reason N.A.T.O. exists; a sovereign nation has been invaded by a hostile force in a land grab ad needs to be defended.  It may not bring Putin to the table, because he may be completely mad.  But at least he defense of the Ukraine would be in capably trained hands and the cost to Russia would be high in a confrontation they could not win.  You don't coddle a bully; you bloody his nose..For England, France, Germany, Poland and other nations, Putin actually committed an act of war by invading.  If a stable Europe depends on a stable Ukraine, let them join N.A.T.O.  The message would be clear, Ukraine is part of Europe."
yucan,,,,of course the uscia was involved in the kiev coup.  and putin should have obama why guantanamo is still open despite the cuban government's wishes,my guess is that there will be no ceasefire as ukraine government will be reluctant to meet rebel demands.  i don't think putin cares about sanctions that much,Putin should go in and do what he is gonna do so everybody can move on,"I see the gas discount as Putin's trump card.

The Kiev Putch was bought and paid for and organized by the USA -  ask Victoria Nuland. The fact that Putin protests so adroitly is the real issue. The US is flummoxed in a response. ..One atrocity after another by the Ukraine government from Odessa to East Ukraine to the MH17 downing by their military jet(s).

The multiple weekly pronouncements by the Kiev Fascists have never been supported. Nor satellite photos of grainy blurred images of fields of equipment that could be controlled by anyone. And yet the US claims it has technology to see a persons face from 50,000 feet?.The singular universally acknowledged truth is the Ukrainian Military is in retreat leaving behind everywhere tons of equipment picked up by the Separatists left in farm houses, fields and warehouses along with munitions. Deserters come for asylum to Russia, their mothers are storming the politicians in Kiev looking for their sons body bags and hiding the rest of their sons to escape new drafts for recruits. Volunteers are flocking from Russia, Chechnya, France and many other places to support Separatist freedom.The fact is the Fascists have no portfolio with the citizens in the south.

To play games, as Obama has done, to both deny that fundamental principle and promote -  as Nuland has said:  with 5 Billion and appointing Yats et al. is both dangerous and doomed from the start...We are at the first stage of the Oblast(s) going their own way from east to west south of the Dnieper River.

HonorB14U,,,,"No new Government of Ukraine, leaning more pro-Russian or pro-European was going to continue with President Yanukovychs deal with Russia to leasing Ukraines Port of Sevastopol for an exchange of a gas-discount because Russia, as is reported, never made good on delivering the discount; that is why President Putin though he had to invade when Ukraine President Yanugovych fell. ..The people of Crimea were concerned about losing their jobs and businesses surrounding the port since former Ukraine President Yushchenko (2005 - 2010) said that Russia was going to have to leave the port by 2017...The people of Crimea only had the choice of joining a dishonest Russia to keep Ukraines Port and their jobs or to stay with Ukraine who would not keep the lease for their Port with a dishonest Russia...How could Russia not know that charging the Ukrainians even more for gas would harm Ukraines economy?  I question if Yanukovych, the former Kremlin advisor, was in on setting up the gas-discount with Russia to destroy Ukraines economy to make it, eventually vulnerable to takeover...Keep in mind, that Yanukovych did not listen to Russia when they advised that he keep armed forces on the former protesters; could that be because he did not trust President Putins advice in the situation because he suspected Putin in destroying him, as well the economy?  Yanukovych might talk if Ukraine official's ask.","Putin militarily entered a country not contested.  Likewise, President Yanugovych was removed from power without his own supporters demanding that he return.  It appears that Ukraine was ready for a change, on both sides supporting pro-European and pro-Russian policies.  Surely, all of the people in Russia knew that...I think of President Putin coming to America after 911 happened to personally offer The White House and America Russias condolences after 911.  I think of Russia helping us militarily in Afghanistan only to find out that the Bush Administration had no plan to create a Democratic government in Afghanistan, which led the international community astray much like the Iraq war led, Americans astray.  I think of Russia offering us shared intelligence against terrorism, and ask, what changed?..The United States gave Russia nothing since our shared credit for ending the Cold War when Russia was willing to build on our relationship.  Russia wanted to continue talks of reducing our international ballistic missiles. Perhaps, it was the Kremlins, and the people of Russias supported way to discourage Iran on arsenal.   ..It is one thing for Nationalist, Russia, to discount the Minority in Crimea, while also discounting Ukraine a National Majority; it is another for the United States to discount Russia in our international relationship as even a Minority worth acknowledging.   Objectily, perhaps the Russian's just want a voice in the world.","Russia not making due on its part of leasing the Port of Sevastopol for Russias Black Sea Fleet in exchange for a gas-discount since ousted President Yanugovych signed the deal in 2010, flaunting disrespect in Ukrainians faces, might suggest that Russia planned an economic sabotage of Ukraine.  No new government of Ukraine, leaning pro-Russian policy or European policy, would have leased the port to a dishonest Russia; this is why Putin acted; and it may be what he wanted; a set-up to win a double-dishonest economic war...Yanugovych, who did not publicly, or politically pressure Russia to make good on the gas-discount price, knowing what it would do to Ukraines economy, further suggests that the former President might have been in on an agenda to set Ukraines economy up to a vulnerable position to join Russia.  ..Since former president Yuschenchko, (before Ukraines, ousted President Yanugovych) who said Russia would have to leave the port by 2017; my guess, is that Russia had a plan.","This is absolutely a failure of a more than lacking Russian leadership to put both Ukrainian sides and the Government of Ukraine in such an uncivilized position of which I am sure all of the Russian people do not want for Ukraine.  The Ukrainians politically differed people have tolerated each other before President Putins invasion of Crimea, and will continue to tolerate each other during Putins faux militant invasion of the rest of Ukraine.   ..I find Russias current administration strategically putting both political leaning sides of Ukraine, and his own military forces, in undefined positions, where they can get killed in the confusion, as inexcusable in this human race. It is an outrageous play of Putins at calling the morally responsible world ignorant of his game and therefore not smart enough to call him on his game that he cheated on yesterday, so he can win again tomorrow...These mafia-style old Middle Eastern militia prove-it politics of Putins, which I guess he implies that only the west is against, would only resemble the rest of the governments putting their military in clown suits to avoid accountability of their countries militarily hitting his administration on this situation.  ..I think Putins anti-international-government rebelling tactics hide the new Russian governments world identity crisis that Putin has done little to define.","I am not interested in the Snowflakes take on the National Security Agency or the old Cold War, Soviet Union activist, Putins, lone take on Russias Constitution, or the truth...Too bad Russian State media cannot publish the funeral for those three Russian Soldiers that Ukraine forces were forced to kill that Putin masked as Ukraine pro-Russian militants or the methods of how Moscow will hide that.  Putin wants to compare mere data collection methods between Russia and The United States to make us look bad?  ..I do not know how Putin might be trying to use Snowden as a weapon against The United States in front of the world, but, for me, Snowden is my so what shield of our American reality of which we have nothing shameful to hide...What is anybodys take on the possibility that the dates of Germanys Chancellor Merkels phone being vacuumed might suggest we had a line in on the former North Korean leader threatening the United States and using Merkels phone line as a cover in our system where the NSA could not publicly defend itself of Snowdens interpreted accusations?..What is anybodys take that China asking the United States what a certain collection of Chinese data we had might suggest that, China knows, that before Snowden, we tracked our own internal information in Chinese to protect our information?   Maybe that is where Snowden came up with his amateur accusation that we had billions of data on China.","Russias invasion of Ukraine invaded both sides political territory, which were tolerating each other before President Putins invasion of Crimea.  ..Surely, all Ukrainians lean towards both European and Russian policies at certain times, and with certain issues, and if Putin had not invaded Crimea, might have leaned more towards Russian policies in Ukraines future even without his invasion.  Now, Putin, with his actions, has ignorantly set up the Ukrainians, in all regions, to rebel and lean more against Russian policies than for them, anyway.  ..I do not know why any of the Russians would want Putin as Russias President anymore when he is forcing Russia on Ukraine like President George Bush tried to force Democracy on Iraq, with underhanded reasoning and with his own, call it as you see it, plan...I think a civil war in such a civilized society, would be an abomination and a real tragedy of which both sides, the countrys reality, is not prepared for, and will they will not consciously be able to handle a civil war very well; it would be heartbreaking for them and spiritually unnerving to see each other killed.   I am very concerned for the Ukrainians; both sides.","While some pro-Russian leaning Ukrainians in the east are already moving to the west, some pro-Russians in the east will not be able to afford to move to the west.  As will some western pro-European leaning Ukrainians, not able to afford to move to the east if Crimea votes to join Russia.  Where will these people on both sides have their Sovereignty Rights in their country represented by Russia in Mr. Putins grand plan?  It is one questionable thing for President Putin to deny Democratic Rights of Citizens, but to deny Sovereignty Rights to citizens and countries is inexcusable in world leadership, under any form of government...Does nationalism mean to President Putin that he can call anything how he sees it differently from the rest of the world?  ..Now that President Putin has encouraged some in Ukraine to politically divide, he has provoked the underlying seeking aggressions of a civil war by leading some in Ukraine to not tolerate each others political positions, and to instead take an unnecessary public exaggerated pride on both labeled-Russian sides of the Ukraine. ..Following Russias actions, there could now be a civil war whether or not, when and if, and after Russia withdraws its unmarked card troops in Putins game, and whether or not, Crimea votes to join Russia.  It appears to me that the Ukraine needs to separate its already tolerated pro-leaning Russian policies from Putins leadership qualities no matter how the Ukraine rules its land.","If Mr. Putin is up for a contest of who can make-up the better excuses to invade a country; the United States with its invasion of Iraq or his Russian Administration invading Ukraine; I think he lost the contest for Russia, either way...Now Mr. Putin will wait to see how the United States comes up with a solution that will be in the interest of Russia, Europe, the Ukraine and the United States to save him from his poor thought-out decision and will then only, give the United States some form of distant respect.   ..I suggest the Government of Ukraine proposing that Russia can keep its naval base in Crimea for 15 billion dollars to pay off the  15 billion European Ukrainian loan if President Putin exits the troops, and the deal is only up until the day before the Crimean election.  Where Ukraine can retain its countrys own voice internationally, no matter how Ukraine decides to rule its land.","Why not sell the Ukraine any necessary oil to the Ukraine and propose letting the Ukraine sell the Port to Russia?..I suggest that the United States, the Obama Administration, and the U.S. Congressional Elect, seek to advise the Ukrainian Government to propose allowing Russia to keep its naval base in Crimea for a price of  15 billion dollars to immediately pay-off the Ukraines 15 billion European loan, if Russia exists the troops, and make the offer only good up until the day before the set Crimea Election, where the Government of Ukraine can then choose to publicly call the election legal or not.  This way, Ukraine will establish its own international voice free of European pressure (that might go-over well with Putins toleration), as well, as free of Putin-Russian influence under this situation.  Then, Ukraines people can have a sense of international independence, and their economy, an immediate chance to grow...The United States can then help the Ukrainian economy further along, by considering the selling of our oil to fill any necessary demand for oil in the Ukraine, and only to Ukraine, instead to all of Europe at this time, where the Russian people might find their economy devastated by President Putins poor leadership.  I think that the Ukraine needs to be free of any influence of Russian oil from Putins-Russia, to protect the Ukraine from Putin possibly sabotaging the new government, at this time.","I think the U.S. needs to find a way to represent and empower both sides inside the Ukraine with diplomacy, but, not Russia.  Why would we search for a diplomatic solution for Russia to exit gracefully in this one situation, when it is both sides in the Ukraine that needs and deserves more of our help?  Lets build on the Obama Administrations new U.S. Foreign Policy with new Middle Eastern governments by not taking sides; but let us also establish new diplomatic ground, where we will not necessarily, always, take the side of all countries in a crisis.  If we help Russia to figure out a way to get out of this mess; Putin may try it again, someday...Let Ukraines government shake it up with Russia.  Offer to sell the Port to Russia for 35 billion over the next two years under the condition that Russia exit its military forces immediately and make the proposed offer only good until the day before the election.  That way the Government of Ukraine will be free to choose to call the election in Crimea legal or not, when Crimeas streets will be clear; immediately payback the 15 billion European loan; and start utilizing all the nations money...Can America sell gas to Ukraine to help its economy to replace the gas that Russia sells to the country?"
northlander,,,,"Ah, chess. Putin is castled in the Ukraine and is making a gambit to take Obama's queen, what he proposes is Syrian opposition to ISIS.

Putin now owns two very expensive and impossible stalemates, Ukraine and Syria. McCain wants us to find more rebels to arm, he is playing checkers.

The industrialist smiled and said, all trucks in Germany technically are military vehicles, next time we will not get stuck in the snow.

Not to say NATO is the better option than mother Russia, it still is looking at not getting stuck in the snow.","A major factor in our issues here is the state of mind of every soul in these former Soviet area.

We have to choose to favor human rights indignation in China or Russia begins to ooze. We have sacrificed the Crimean rook. Putin has castled. Our move is east.","The EU certainly needs another deadbeat on its hands, we need another instant defaulting loan, and Putin needs to keep the Black Sea ports and not shovel rubles into the mire in Ukraine. Looks like another win-win-win scenario.","This reminds me of Catherine the Great's insistence on commanding the Crimea as an extension of her empire, wanting to access the Dardanelles and have command of the Black Sea's ports a major item.  It was about water, not land or people. Turkey nettles the Russians now as always, and we are there. The RealPolitik being played out is that Putin needs Ukraine more than the reverse, and lurking in his mind is the Chinese border and the threat that presents. The US role, considering we still have a presence in Afghanistan, is as nominal balancer, leading sanctions at best. No Jimmy Carter boycott available now. I suspect if he could have his druthers, Putin would let Ukraine sink into its debt quagmire, come wining home to mama Russia after being IMF'ed by the ECU. But swords are for rattlin'.","At the risk of once again being labeled as a sycophant, I reiterate that Obama's long game makes sense. We have no strategy because there is no possibility of having one other than containment in Syria. Obama has no tactical capability to apply, he has no Congressional support for boots other than McCain's forward observers (where is forward anyway?). The Russians have fine technology and a record of idiotic application, as in the Malaysian airliner shoot down. When a drunk walks into the bar waving a pistol, just leave. Let him own it for a while. We must know who te 5 people are who we have fully trained. Give them a ticket to Germany. And just give Putin room to fail, with his client Assad. We are not weak because Russia has to prop up their boy. Something's working.",,,
R36,,,,"The idea of Putin attacking Poland or Lithuania or even Kiev itself is nonsense.  Putin may or may not be a bully, let us say he is, but he is not going to put  his hand in the fire which will happen if he attacks any NATO country...But what about Poroshenko?  He seems rash.  He certainly would be willing to put Obama's or Merkel's hand in the fire if he is allowed to...It is a pity that the NY Times is refusing to recognize how aggressive Poroshenko has been in dealing with the rebels.  Accommodate the legitimate interests of the other is the way, and not war.   The fighting started because Poroshenlo decided to use force to put down the rebels (he called them bandits) in east Ukraine...The West should tell him to calm down before he drags the rest of us into world war.","I see the US and EU as carrying out a slow expansion of.NATO until it reached Russia's borders and Russia became alarmed.  Putin may be a bully.at home but when we consider that he has the support of 85 of Russians and of Gorbachev,.it is clear that making Putin central is a semantic trick.  It is Russians who are.defending themselves against Western encroachment.   ..There is only one bully in the picture and it is Poroshenko.  People have short memories and forget that he used his air force to attack his own people, the rebels in east Ukraine. Of course Putin helped the rebels.  They would have been sitting ducks without his help.  And of course Putin is lying when he denies that he helped the rebels.  There is no way they could defend themselves against Kiev without his help...The only solution is autonomy for east Ukraine while.remaining a part of Ukraine, Putin has been proposing it and Poroshenko has been resisting it...Putin has MINIMAL goals as is obvious (to any unbiased person) from his actions.  Thee response to talk about Putin as Hitler or Putin the Czar is a distortion and a prelude  to war.","My best guess as to the answers to your questions is:..a) 'When well they be satisfied?   I suspect they are already satisfied...b)  Will they proceed to Kiev?  They will NOT go as far as Kiev or even move out of the Donblass...Having an independent or autonomous Donblass has always been the aim of the separatists and Putin.  All their actions and their talk is consistent with that.  But the Western media have gone on and on so much about Puin the Czar and Putin as Hitler that we have not understood that if we were in the shoes of the rebels our aims might be the same...One may or may not agree that their cause is just, but if we have any sense we will see that what they want is understandable.  The separatists do not trust Poroshenko and do not want to be ruled by him.  What is so strange about that?",given one of the principal parties wasn't at the table?..The separatists were not at the table because Poroshenko would not allow them to come.  They said from the very start that they would not respect the ceasefire as far as Debaltseve was concerned and they have kept their word...But the Western media will go on and on pretending that it is all done by Putin the liar.,"President Vladimir Putins Russia would be quite happy to absorb all of Ukraine,..But there is no evidence of this. And note that it is Putin who has suggested the federalization of a united Ukraine and it is Poroshenko who opposes it...Putin does not want to absorb all of Ukraine - he just does not want NATO at his doorstep and he wants the rights of Russian speakers in Ukraine to be respected.   It is not too much to ask and could be achieved except that Poroshenko opposes it and since he is our guy we encourage him in his foolishness.  Merkel sees this.  It is a pity that Kerry and Biden do not see it.","This is a dangerous fantasy.  If you compare the two, Putin's actions now are much more modest than those of Kennedy who brought the world to the brink of nuclear war over Cuba...The West committed slow aggression against Russia through a gradual expansion of NATO and is now pretending that Putin is the aggressor.  This is a very dangerous way to think as it will lead us directly into war.","the US and Ukrainian governments, and their media outlets, are fanning the flames instead of providing calm reason, which is the only thing that will resolve this crisis...Why not add the NY Times to this list?    Demonizing Putin and the rebels has become a knee jerk reaction so that the question is not being asked, Where are we going with this?..Any resolution of the crisis will require addressing the concerns of both Russia and the rebels and demonizing them from the get go is not going to lead to a solution.","Putin did not create this crisis, Victoria Nuland did and the US and EU rushing forward to recognize a government brought into effect by a coup...Putin was only protecting himself from the West's power grab.","If you are interested in a peaceful resolution of the crisis, this might be good advice to give to Mr. Obama, Mr Kerry, and last but not least, to Victoria Nuland.  She deliberately trod on Russia's corns and expects Russia to apologize...Mr. Putin may not be a nice guy, but that other nice guy, Mr. Gorbachev supports him.   Might you consult HIM?..Enough with your preaching already.","But didn't Russia abide by that promise for 20 years?  Who was it who upset the apple cart?  It was the West, expanding NATO and encouraging the overthrow of an elected government in Ukraine by force.  ..It is too late to force Putin to eat crow.  You will get a wider war if you are not careful.  And you are pretending that it is all Putin but the rebels have minds and goals of their own.   I doubt they are taking orders from Putin...Maybe Putin could lay down the law to rebels, but will he do it to please Obama?"

BTW: we won the Cold War because of Reagan, Bush, Thatcher and other cold war warriors.  (Biden and Kerry not included).

We survived the fall of Saigon, we can survive the fall of Minsk, or Kiev, or whatever.  There are no dominoes about to fall.  Russia is near bankruptcy.  Ukraine is already bankrupt.  Let Putin seize the Ukraine, it will push Russia over the edge.  Let him have Greece too.",Putin is playing Reagan?  Odd comparison.  Is Obama playing Carter?,"Good saying, but what does it mean in this instance?  Putin didn't bluff.  He is not pulling out of Crimea.  We can't do much, or should.  Putin is offering to continue the dialogue, and the world will go on.  Whatever mistakes the President and the EU made (and there were plenty), it predates the actual annexation of Crimea.

We showed our respect for the new, democratic, and weak Russia by bombing Serbia for 11 weeks while Bill Clinton entertained guests at the White House with his funny imitations of a drunken Boris Yeltsin.

Such a decision may be expected . . . to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking. Clinton didn't take heed. Bush abrogated the ABM Treaty, and the Obama State Department deployed millions of dollars to stoke a putsch in Ukraine designed to thwart Russian Influence. ..It certainly seems that Mr. Putin does have a valid point, and the anti Russian propaganda extravaganza launched by the US during the Sochi Olympics must have appeared to be insult to injury to the Russian People, who seem to love Mr. Putin. When one considers a thousand years of his awful predecessors, who can blame them?..Mr. Putin would rather do business and strengthen business alliances than fight as evinced by his gas pipeline deal recently with Greece, but he is also willing to fight when backed into a corner, and successive American Presidential Administration have worked hard to back Putin into a corner... How do the Europeans feel about all of this? Well Angela Merkel just this week closed 62 German Military bases in order to free up 77 thousand acres of land for parks and recreation, and as we all know the sanctions are more symbolic than real. They are likely to stay that way. Russia has proximity to Ukraine with overwhelming force. So what are we really up to other than scaring nearly everybody.","We waged a Cold War for fifty years against the revolutionary forces of Bolshevik Russia at great cost, and now we are probably going to be stuck with a 100 billion dollar bill for an upgrade of a dilapidated nuclear deterrent to wage another cold war against Counter Revolutionary Russia. Maybe it's just Russia that we don't like, because certainly Putin is a liberal compared to his rivals in Russia, It's not like we weren't warned by no less an authority than Diplomat George Kennan that: Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the post cold-war era.

His attempts to facilitate the safe exploitation of oil reserves in the polar region, and the Shanghai Cooperative Organization are examples of mutualism among nations to achieve profits by other than war...The US is still stuck in the anachronistic blather of the Raj, and the mostly non functional Pax Americana has brought anger and destabilization to every region, which we have attempted to quell, in the name of Empire. The fact that the age of empire ended with the collapse of the Raj notwithstanding. We are making right fools of ourselves.","Vlad Putin has a long history of fighting jihadism, and it is a sad fact that America created the monster that Takfiri Salafism has become, when we formed up the mujahedin Freedom Fighters to fight Russia in Afghanistan. Putin knows very clearly that: Secular leaders who are cosmopolitan, and have progressed beyond medieval suspicions of modernity ARE NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM. ..Saddam Hussein held Iraq for the baath socialist center until America destroyed him, and the Middle East without him has degenerated into a tribal dystopia.

Had neocon undersecretary of State Nuland respected Russia's need to maintain its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea, and not financed, through the Secretariat of State a fascist putsch in Ukraine to undermine Russian influence, this war probably would not be happening. Had Bill Clinton not expanded NATO into Poland this war might not be happening. Had George W Bush not rescinded the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty with the intent to deploy missiles on Russia's borders this war might not be happening, but they did, and the blame for the consequences is not for Putin to bear alone. ..The sad fact is that the US has no interest in Russian integration into the European System because were that to happen NATO would immediately become anachronistic, and Europe would become the most powerful economic bloc in the world, with no need to collude with our Beltway Machiavellians.

Russia could never tolerate this threat to her security, but she never went so far as John F Kennedy did in enforcing the terms of the Monroe Doctrine against Russia's attempt to do the same in the American Caribbean...JFK took us to the brink of nuclear conflagration. Russia merely protested loudly the American deployment of ABM's on her border...Clinton of course got the trek to a new Cold War with Russia going by expanding NATO, and bombing Belgrade, in order to show the Russians that they no longer had a sphere of influence. There was going to be no Monroe Doctrine for Russia...A coup may be in the eyes of the beholder, but when a legally constituted government is overthrown, at the monetary encouragement of a foreign power, in this case the US State Department, at the direction of Under Secretary Victoria Nuland, the word Coup is probably accurately applied to the recent regime change in Kiev. ..That Ms. Nuland is a member of the KaganPodhoretzCristol Cabal of neocon adventurers, if one considers that these same people fabricated the pretexts which caused the US to destroy Iraq, probably went a long way toward cementing the idea in the mind of Putin that the intent was to make the Black Sea a NATO Lake.

Did Bill Clinton bomb Serbia in order to force the secession of Kosovo from Serbia and the Russian sphere of influence on the recommendation of his Neocon Secretary of State Madeline Albright.

Really now!","I wonder what it would take for the American people to finally catch on to a propaganda format which has been played and replayed for nearly the last seventy years. Apparently Putin like the Palestinians must allow his country to be attacked, and if he defends his prerogatives, he is immediately guilty of defying the American hegemon.  He becomes the subject of a Goldstein like rant by the US consolidated media, while the financiers of the Empire tear at the guts of his society. I guess nobody read 1984.

Eugah,,,,"Ukraine entering NATO is on no one's mind except Putin's.  Every Ukrainian knows that entering NATO will only happen when there is a new dispensation in Russia and Russia itself restores a trusting relationship with the alliance, which is quite a plausible scenario once the Putin regime exhausts itself...You argument is a red herring.","The Russians only have the means to escalate for a little while.  Putin knows he has no way of invading and occupying so large a territory as Eastern Ukraine.  The complement of truly battle ready forces in the Russian army is less than 100,000 men.  The ability of the Russian armed forces to feed, clothe an arm this many men over any length of time is questionable, at best.  Then there is the domestic legitimacy aspect of this engagement.  Until now the return of the zinc boxes containing the corpses of brave young Russian men has been kept a secret.  When thousands are coming back it wont be.  There is no propaganda offensive the Putin regime can unleash that will withstand the backlash from regular Russian citizens when their sons start being taken from them in large numbers, usually under false pretenses.  Putin's interest is ultimately in not ending up like Yanukovich or worse, Quadaffi. That out come becomes forseeable once he commits large numbers of Russian troops to this conflict.  ..For me, the difficult part of the idea of sending weapons is timing: Russian forces could capture a lot of ground by the time the anti-artillery radars and anti-tank weapons in the theater.  The best hope would seem to be that by threatening to introduce the weapons Putin might see the logic in dialing back his commitment and living up to the September Minsk accords.","There has always been an influential force within the Russian elite (the FSB) which never acknowledged the post-cold-war arrangements with the West.  They managed to create seething conflicts in the successor states to the Soviet Union that would be exploited later for just this kind of strategy. For a time, the secret contempt these people had for the sovereignty of these successor states was kept under wraps.  Now, in the waning period of the Putin regime, when the legitimacy of authoritarian rule can no longer be based on the appeal to Russians' economic self-interest (because of the utter failure of this kleptocratic administration to institutionalize a free market economy) an appeal is being made to a sense of loss of empire and wounded national pride. It is the same (false) sense of grievance that Hitler appealed to in his bid for power in Germany and that various ultra-right wing forces in France were trying to appeal to following the end of the Algerian War.  It is in their minds.  It is not in reality.","Putin will never agree to a deal where Russia is responsible for what happens in the Donbass.  He wants it to remain nominally under Ukrainian control but in fact controlled by the Kremlin.  This is the logic of Russian strategy in creating frozen conflicts.  He would like the West and Kyiv to have all of the burden of administering this god-forsaken part of the country as a point of pressure on the consolidating democracy in the West.  Putin wants no part of the Colin Powell dictum of You break it, you own it because then he would become responsible for it.",Putin is a gangster and a liar. He and his friends have systematically built a form of administration that exists to extract resource rents for their sole benefit.

He does not live up to his commitments.,"Bill..You forgot the most important face of Putin that rarely gets mentioned in the West: the Administrative Chief in charge of a universe of corruption not seen outside of Africa...Putin himself is reliably identified as having stolen at least 40 billion dollars of property from the Russian people. His homologue in Ukraine, Yanukovich, cannot be taken down because of the fear of demonstration effects on the  RUSSIAN people.....The entire point of Putinism is the expropriation of wealth by a corrupt government, populated by KGB gangsters and the people who don't dare to cross them.

Yes..Can the USA or NATO do anything about it? No..We do not have a military in North America or all of Europe geared for taking on a 1st World industrial military machine like Russia. Bush squandered our Cold War stockpiles of munitions on Angry Goat Herders and Obama decided that Drones for blowing up Pakistani kids were more important than new jets and tanks...Entering into hostilities with Russia(especially on their own turf) is suicide and sending weapons to Ukraine will be seen as an act of aggression...The US meddling in Syria(a Russian Ally) was the beginning of this tension(thanks Hillary) and they are calling our bluff in Ukraine and Mr Obama has carefully crafted a military leadership and policy that is 100 geared for Low Intensity Conflict against indigenous personnel not a major conventional military power like Russia...This battle is already lost, you can start mourning for a free and democratic Ukraine right now because it's already over.","I see many comments by Russian apologists who forget very recent history and trot out the Russian storyline that Western-backed Nazis took over the Ukraine in an illegal coup...Yanukovych reneged on promises to develop closer economic ties with Europe and instead made a back-room deal with Putin despite vigorous majority public opposition to this. Protests erupted demanding changes to Yanukovych's policies and cronyism. Eventually the military fired on unarmed civilians killing 80 people. Yanukovych fled when he realized his previous allies in government no longer supported him or more important, would not protect him...Next, Russia annexed Crimea when Ukrainian government politicians and security forces deserted Yanukovych, with Russia all the while stating that there were no Russian military forces in Crimea. This was a lie. They then held a quick referendum (under a Russian armed presence) to join the Russian federation and secede from the Ukraine, in violation of the Ukrainian constitution...Russia has been moving arms, men, logistical support, and anti-aircraft missiles (including the one that shot down a civilian airliner killing all on board) into the Eastern Ukraine. A civil war ensued and many people have been killed on both sides...The debate on whether the West should supply arms to the Ukrainian government is very necessary - but let's get the facts straight about what led up to this situation.","I do not wish to defend Putin's rash, short-sighted, and dangerous actions, but in one sense he does have a point.  Since the 17th century Russia has placed a very high value on Crimea--its window to the west and only warm-water port.  This current crisis can, in part, be placed at the feet of arrogant men who sought to re-shape the world in their image by re-drawing old ethnic boundaries with little regard for those affected by treaties or land-swaps.  Considering the bloody histories of the former Yugoslavia or Viet Nam, for instance, perhaps a Russian Crimea, with its historic precedents(allowing for firm guarantees of Ukranian sovereignty and continued access to the Black Sea) might be the lesser evil in the long run.","Somebody needs to clue Putin in to these agreements.  His latest rhetoric sounds like that routinely employed by the tzars or Stalin.  Evidently, things must not be going well in Russia is he's reduced to this sort of grand-standing and brinkmanship.",Wow.  Just wow.  Putin can take questions on TV because he controls all the TV stations and that means any question he gets he wrote.  It really defies logic the sorts of equivalencies that are being drawn over this matter.,"To those who suggested Snowden could provide the same service in Russia as he provided by exposing security information in the US, please realize that Putin would no more let this man near Russian intelligence than he would John Kerry. Being in Russia is not the same as being inside in Russia. Snowden is servicing his purpose as a tool of Russia's dictator. Nothing more.","You can't be serious.  Do you suppose that Snowden was unaware that Putin controls all the media in Russia?  Do you suppose that Snowden was unaware that the entire purpose of his being offered the chance to ask the question was anything more than a political stunt by Putin to act as propaganda for his dictatorship?  If so, then you haven't got much faith in Mr. Snowden's basic intelligence.  So what then is the basis of your pride in him?",Does anybody with half a brain trust Putin to stick to this cease fire?  It's a land grab to keep the mindless Russians distracted from the financial ruin he's brought on their country.
Ted Pikul,,,,Pretty much Putin's script at this point.,"Any suggestion of belligerence on our part, in response to Russia's barely defensible actions toward Ukraine - there was, in fact, a non-democratic deposition of a democratically elected regime - would truly demonstrate a disturbing lack of realism.  There is a very good chance that Russia will annex Crimea via the threat of force.  That is something that we, and Russia, will have to live with.  However, it will not occur because of a lack of resolve on our part; it will occur because we are not willing to risk a potentially catastrophic military engagement in order to prevent the annexation of a small (but strategic) part of a (small) ally.  We have made it clear that we will punish Russia economically; Putin himself must know that Russia will become, in some sense, a pariah state in today's world if it chooses to use the threat of force to annex Crimea.  Now, we can only wait.  There is no need to further bait the bear...Being the world's policeman - which is what the world expects of us, even if it's not the job most of us want - doesn't (yet) require that we preemptively conduct ourself like a hair-trigger psychopath.",,,,,,,,

Putin has proven many times that he cannot be trusted and he will not hesitate to use brutal force against Russia neighbors if he sees them weak. However, his word suddenly from the last paragraph is honest. He would not move suddenly his army; he did not do it in Ukraine. He uses a hybrid approach with weakening first the country and its alliances by political and economic means and uses his internal allies to start the rebellion. He then sends unmarked soldiers and equipment through uncontrolled border areas and sets up the permanent mess in the country until everybody agrees on the status quo.  This is why we need the strong presence of NATO forces at the Eastern NATO borders that will make Putin's hybrid approach useless and deters him from even starting the whole process.","Putin simply wants Eastern Ukraine for Russia and it has nothing to do with any national dialogue in Ukraine.  He rather thinks about the kind of dialog among Russians to please those who proudly display portraits of Stalin during chauvinistic rallies in the Red Square.  Putin just has established the Euro Asian Union, as an adversarial construct to EU, and will be pushing and marching into new territories as long as Russia has enough resources to do that. Unfortunately, we have to recognize that we do not have at the moment means to stop him in Ukraine particularly that Ukrainians do not seem to have much inclination to defend their country. What we should focus on right now is to build much strong barriers and powerful deterrence along the EUNATO borders from the Baltic Republics to the Black Sea. There has to be much more US and NATO presence along the Eastern perimeters of EU, particularly in Baltic countries and Poland since it is obvious that Putin will take advantage of any voids and weaknesses there. In addition, I hope that the current visit of Ms. Merkel to US will mark the beginning of serious joined US and EU action to free EU from the trade with Russia. This is the best long term solution to deprive Putin from the means to influence Western policies and weaken our alliance.","We should stop creating illusions about a possibility of a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian problem.  There is a big difference in the meaning of diplomatic solution between Russia and us. For Putin it means achieving his goals without a need for military action. For us it is a compromise. His goals are clear, he has been spelling them for about two decades. We obviously have not listened and kept reinterpreting his words in a peaceful way. When are we finally going to hear what he is actually saying instead of pretending that he said something else?  The truth is that he want to restore the Soviet Union in a form of Asian European Union which eventually will swallow EU. Ukraine was a critical part of this design and he is committed to preventing its transformation and its tilt towards EU. He wants to reverse all what happened in Ukraine and bring this country back on the Kremlin leash. If we and Ukrainians agree to all of this, it is going to be the diplomatic solution in Putins interpretation. Otherwise, we have to stop fooling ourselves and send good lethal weapons to Ukraine, a lot of weapons.","Yes, we must stay together, NATO, EU. Putin apparently thought that he would be able to destroy our unity and carry out his plans to restore a kind of new Soviet Union and dominate Europe. In contrast, he sees that his actions have the opposite effects and his frustration is growing. Consequently, he barrages us with all these threats in the act of desperation. Only our strong resolve can eventually stop this madness.","I believe the Minsk agreement will only embolden Putin to continue the policies based on brutal military force. We need to address it globally and strategically by defining our long term policies on confining Russian threats. This has to include better NATO preparedness, strengthening our strategic forces and particularly our antimissile defenses around the US and NATO perimeters. We also have to sign the transatlantic trade agreement with EU which should include mechanisms to protect EU from the trade dependence on Russia. The events of last year, and particularly last several months since the Minsk 1 agreement vividly showed an ugly, brutal and ruthless character of Putin Russia. This actually should not be any surprise because Putin have been clearly announcing this features for about two decades now. Our policies on Russia must be developed not just for months or a year but for a decade or more; we must stop stepping back and stop accepting Russia as it is now. It is our enemy.","First of all, why do not we stop using the term separatists and call them for what they really are, that is, Russian Army.  The only truth about this conflict is that Putin brutally invaded Ukraine because Ukrainians were not willing to subject themselves to the Kremlin leash...Facing the overwhelming forces of the Russian Army in Debaltseve, Ukrainians made a correct decision to stop fighting and withdraw. Yet, despite the Minsk agreements, which supposedly were going to plant the seeds of peace, Russians viciously attacked the withdrawing Ukrainian forces. This is another evidence that Putin clearly wants to defeat and subdue Ukraine, not to make the peace, and he has made a long term plans for this war... How are going to respond to this permanent problem which is likely to stretch for years? The current appeasement approach is not working. It only emboldens Putin. The current level of sanctions is a joke. So far only oil process hit Russia but Putin knows he can just wait it over. We need an effective, long term policy to counteract Putin and stop Russia...Mr. President, it is time for your leadership.","While EU intensifies the negotiations efforts, Russia intensifies its military assaults on the Ukrainian positions in the Ukrainian territory... Mr. President, stop weighing options and send weapons to Ukraine. ..If we continue the appeasement policy with Russia, we better get ready for a nuclear war because Putin becomes confident that we will always blink and he will keep advancing against us to the end. For example, it has been just announced that Russia is going to build military bases in Cyprus...How long are we going to keep repeating the mistakes of 1938? Until we all die?","It looks like another Putin's public manipulation to soften the resolve of EU and NATO. He targets mostly some members of the alliance which would rather see less confrontational approach to Russia. However, it would be a grave mistake of EU and NATO to postpone of reduce new sanctions or projected military preparedness because Putin is just trying ruthlessly to make fool of the West as he has been doing it for a decade now. He wants to make three steps forwards and two steps back, over and over, and quickly figure out how far he can move.  And he will go any place as far as we let him.","This is certainly not the end of problems for Ukraine. Putin is committed to stopping and reversing the reforms in Ukraine because this is the only way to take Ukraine again on the Kremlin leash in the future. He wants the Eastern Ukraine to become the Russian anchor for stopping the reforms and Ukrainian movement towards EU. I hope Kiev will not include the separatist republics into the parliament and in any decision making body. The rebels must be kept away from any sensitive information as well. In short, they have to be isolated, eliminated from anything that concerns the transformations of Ukraine into the western society and its relations with EU and USA. Otherwise, Ukraine will be wasting money we will provide in assistance. This would be a very costly failure for the West.  We need to watch these developments very carefully.","I doubt if Putin worries too much about Kadyrovs influence. For now, Kadyrov is a useful tool for Kremlin in eliminating the opposition while Putins can still claim that his own hands are not too dirty. I am not surprised that we hear the hints that Kadyrov may actually be a rival of some kind  for Putin now when Putin wants to deflect the blame for killing Niemtsov. Kadyrov is surely fully aware of the fact that he is going to be fine only as long as he serves the roles written for him by Kremlin, at least for the time being. However, his future may not be pleasant after all since Russian history teaches us that lives and careers of such dedicated activists can be transient."

Iryna,,,,"The big difference between the US and Russia is that the US has a truly democratic government and separate legislative and judicial systems whereas the Russian government is malevolent and until the disintegration of the Soviet Union it ruled by suppressing the rights, such as freedom of speech, of its citizens..With Putin in power the Russian government is once again becoming increasingly totalitarian where all opposition is being suppressed or killed off..By invading Ukraine and supporting terrorism in Ukraine the Russian government is acting contrary to International Laws which recognize the inviolability of a nation's sovereignty. This kind of self-interest should not be tolerated by the international community.","Putin seeks power. His invasion of Ukraine didn't quite work out as he had planned, so he turned his attention to the war in Syria and to aiding his ally Assad. The US should not join any coalition led by Russia. Let the Russians prove their mettle in fighting in a religious sectarian war. The US can continue with air strikes against IS, aiding refugees and monitoring Russian activity so that it does not extend beyond attacking IS..It's troubling that there seems to be no moderate leader in Syria as an alternative to Assad. After president Hosni Mubarak's removal from power in Egypt the Egyptian army leaders were able to stop extremist Muslims from taking over the government.","How is breaking International laws by seizing a sovereign nation's territory (Crimea and eastern Ukraine), causing war, terror, over a million refugees,  so right? Putin is an international criminal. There's nothing right about Putin or his intentions.","Putin has moved weapons into Syria not only to gain influence there but also to enhance his position in the world by appearing to be the good guy fighting IS terrorists. These actions don't alter the fact that he is a thug and terrorist himself, seizing Crimea and eastern Ukrainian territory, causing a flood of refugees (1 million) fleeing regions of eastern Ukraine..Putin is ready to talk - I wonder why. Is he afraid of taking on IS by himself?.He is not going to shift from his support of Assad. The only encouraging sign is that Assad is ready for political compromise with the healthy part of the opposition..The US should never form a coalition with Putin in Syria.","A great analysis. Putin is a bigger threat to Europe than ISIS is to Iraq and the Middle East. His plan is to destabilize Europe by fomenting wars and unrest, firstly in Ukraine and then as he sees fit, perhaps in Poland, the Baltic States or even other former Soviet nations such as Bulgaria..Under Putin, Russia is a belligerent country having invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation, albeit in a surreptitious fashion. The Russian government is hiding involvement in this war even from its own citizens..Of course the US should supply weapons to Ukraine so that they have a better means of defending themselves..Russia should be dropped  from hosting the World Soccer Cup in 2018 unless they stop their aggression against peaceful nations and pay for the damage they have caused in Ukraine.","Daniel, Putin's interests - expansion by seizing territory that is part of another sovereign nation, is not legal according to international laws.",If there are many Ukrainian casualties then Putin is responsible and a war criminal since he is constantly supplying his proxies with sophisticated rockets and artillery in violation of the declared ceasefire.,"The new Ukrainian government never threatened the people of eastern Ukraine. It wasn't until Putin's thugs started killing local government officials and barricading buildings that a conflict began and rightly so, since the protests were violent and initiated by a foreign government, not by the people of eastern Ukraine. The people of eastern Ukraine certainly aren't better off now with no money or food, homes destroyed and I wonder how well they will enjoy living under a totalitarian state governed by a bunch of thugs who kill and torture any opposition.","@Gracchus- Putin is pursuing a foreign policy that is the tradition of Russian leaders from Ivan the terrible to Nicholas 1.......You are referring to a different era. Expansionism and invasion of another sovereign nation (Ukraine) and seizing foreign territory is not acceptable by International Laws in modern times..You forgot to mention another great Russian leader, Stalin, who murdered over 7 million Ukrainians by starvation in 1933..Ukrainians have had enough of Russian  utopia and have every right to pursue a democratic path.","@Porco Rosso - Putin is the war criminal - he invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine with his special forces, soldiers tanks and missiles, organized local thugs and continues to kill and terrorize the citizens of Ukraine.His aim is to seize Ukrainian territory along the Black Sea and he needs to be stopped."
justin sayin,,,,It's hard to gauge Putin's directive in this time and space. Was it done because of sanctions imposed and world criticism or just a pause to realign a strategy for a takeover?,"As Putin's action settles in and as we read the purpose of such, it lends  credence to his argument. As Russia's only warm water port as well as it's historical importance, and it's Russian majority, as the dust settles and there is no further encroachment on Putin's part, this may be acceptable to the West .","As the days, hours and minutes tick away and as Putin postures with empty agreements and false intentions he pushes ever slowly to annexing Ukraine. He knows quite confidently that nothing or no one can stop him and if he is successful with this coup why not continue into Poland and beyond. It'll be a piece of cake. At this point with so little effective opposition to his movements he's probably wondering why he didn't begin this empire building many years sooner!",Putin appears to be loosening the strings on the impression of his oppression. He seems to be in the process of shedding his image from that of a KGB autocrat to a more magnanimous leader of a diverse empire. He has come to realize that with this image-change he can accomplish more things both diplomatically and domestically while still remaining in total control .,With the worldwide communications we are wired with in this day and age the resolving of issues beats down the timeframe from months to days. The sanctions President Obama flung at Putin with no hesitation and with European leaders in tow forced him to rethink his impetuous actions and chose the uncharacteristic route of diplomacy. Let's hope this is not a ploy but a serious effort to salvage his relations with all countries involved .,Rectifying this catastrophic situation is in Putin's hands and he will move slowly yet confidently that he will eventually rally public opinion to his side. He will take the separatists to task and reevaluate the strategy of controlling them so that future disasters like this can be avoided. Don't think for one moment that as horrific as this event was that it will change his course of annexing the Ukraine as well as eventually the other former republics .,Will be a big blow to Putin's pride. He still wanted to showcase Sochi. The consequences of his actions called for this move to perhaps make him hesitate on any future moves into Ukraine .,After talks with the Ukrainian President assuring him that they will work together for a peaceful solution Putin pulls a double-cross and proceeds with a planned invasion in place. He appears to be under a false illusion that he can pull off these moves secretly without being noticed like a throwback to the fifties. The question now is can a coalition of countries focusing on extreme sanctions have a damaging impact or does Putin just have the ability to brush them off as a mere annoyance as he has done up till now?,Putin has to move fast and infuse money into the Ukraine as the US did with the TARP program to save the banks. He realizes that if he doesn't quell unrest before it gets out of hand he may be facing the beginning of a 'Russian Spring' .,
soxared04/07/13,,,,"So, the U. S. business establishment fears that sanctions levied against Comrade Putin will create a breach in international commerce that countries elsewhere will fill the vacancies left by America? So, if President Obama sits on his hands and does nothing, there will be silent congratulations from the Right for the president's complicity with Comrade Putin's land grab, enabling America's lords of commerce to reap even greater profits with cheaper labor elsewhere? Sounds like a plan to me.","Anyone who defends President Vladimir Putin for perpetrating this outrage ought to consider the very obvious: he has something to hide. A true, or, in this case, an honorable statesman, would have given the order to clear the way for international workers to begin the grim task of piecing together the remains of the crash site in order to begin a reconstruction of the events which removed 298 souls from their loved ones. If Comrade Putin's hands were clean, his rebel surrogates would not now be sanitizing the accident culture to dress it up for presentation to the world as completely different from what most of us suspect it to be: collateral damage writ large committed by two governmental entities engaged in a power struggle centered upon natural resources, military access, and political considerations. The dead, here, had not a thing to do with Russia and Ukraine. The grieving families and friends should not be palmed off with such shabby treatment. Mr. Putin: what say you?","Comrade Vladimir Putin did not give the order to the missile battery to blow MH17 out of the sky. Seen another way, the Russian president's fingerprints, the ones soaked with innocent blood, were all over  the missile's firing mechanism. News accounts have reported that Ukrainian military forces were overrun by separatists and seized the Buk missile apparatus. Other reports say the Russian army brought the Buk with them when they threw off the charade of protection for those yearning for closer ties with Mother Russia and attacked the Ukraine in a naked land grab. That the Buk was in play at all can be laid at Mr. Putin's feet. He turned his back on his irresponsible military; it, in its turn, slept while the separatists treated the missiles like a toy. Mr. Putin is all alone now. He will blame others for this great disaster. Perhaps now, the scales have been removed from Europe's eyes and they now realize that Russia is nobody's friend, having, in one short day, declared itself the most dangerous enemy of the civilized world.",What a bunch of milquetoasts these would-be angry European leaders are! One can tell from their tepid comments that they fear to displease the Russian bear. He's stalling because they've no spine. Putin is the conductor of this hellish symphony and he' s playing Europe for a fool.,"Comrade Putin accomplished what thugs usually do: little and very short term. While the mountebanks and charlatans at Fox News were lionizing their hero President Obama was telling the Russian bear that continued aggression in the Ukraine would result in sanctions. Everyone laughed at the president. The great minds at Fox (Palin, Giuliani) snickered and scoffed at President Obama's banks, not tanks strategy. Who's holding the marbles now, indeed?","Comrade Putin is the world's No. 1 gangster. Back in the day, when Nikita Khruschchev reigned, even he had the honor to declare himself. He swore to the Americans, we will bury you. Comrade Putin isn't bothering to disguise his theft of a sovereign nation. America can only freeze the assetsaccounts of the ruling Politburo and request our timid allies to do likewise. Otherwise, welcome to pre-WW II redux.","It says here that Comrade Putin is a gangster and has begun turning a nation of consequence into a rogue state. If the West's determined economic siege closes off rich markets and opportunities to Russian consumers, will Putin cover his tracks while in full retreat and try to fool his people with a dishonorable ruse or two? He won't go quietly. To look at him, I see a vulpine, calculating intelligence behind the face that conceals the crocodile's lethal patience. What is coming will not be pretty.",,,

If left unchecked, there is no reason Putin would not invade Finland or block off the Baltic Sea.   (Remember the scene from Top Gun where the Russian and U.S. fighter jets are close together?

The Western Europeans did nothing and the United States did nothing.   There's a well worn analogy in that part of European history...The Ukrainians are ethnically Celtic and Scandinavian and well as Slavic.   Over the course of the last 300 years, the Russians enslaved most Ukrainians as slavesserfs and then as forced collective farm labor, as miners and factory workers paid starvation wages, but the Ukrainians' Celtic and Scandinavian brothers looked the other way.   The Russians killed over 10 Million Ukrainians during the last 100 years, and neither Western Europe or the United States gave a hoot, let alone did anything about it...Don't expect NATO, i.e. the U.S. and Western Europe to do anything now.

Best way for russia and putin is ensure that they keep the nuclear arm force in prime condition. Because West will come out at russia every angle. They will try to sneak in and create havoc and chaos. West do not mind people dying outside of their sphere of influence. OBAMA does nothing to ISISISIL because they want to remove assad so Israel can expand more inside syria with forced war.  West is conducting JIHAD against russia and putin because they refuse to obey to USA reckless policies. I prefer stronger russia to keep West in check. Most dangerous to peace in the world is WEST other than Islamist. But alqaeda and ISIL do not exist without CIA plan.  Russia also start using muslims ( free soldiers) against west because i strongly believe WEST wants to use muslims to attack russia. It is coming soon. Russia better ready for war , russia can not win conventional war against WEST. So russia better have few nuke submarines parked in cuba as deterrent.","Ukrainian army did down Russian airliner over Black Sea in 1990s and killed all passengers and crew, there was a prominent physicist on board (Physics Today). They can easily do it again given an unconditional support by the US administration..The UA officials have openly suggested their patriots would be justified in killing Putin. Did they aim at Putin's plane on the same route a few minutes apart?","After 911 and iraq , i stop believing in any news story in western media. I take opposite view as truth. Putin is a russian nationalist and patriot. Bankers do not like any nationalist except zionist. So they want to get rid of him and bring russia under their rule. its the end goal.  They are treating putin like saddam hussein and qaddafi now. Painting putin as evil do not work. if i am putin though send spies who create problem across europe. for russia to survive its enemies has to have internal problem. if not russia is done as a country. it does not matter russia has all technologies and nukes. No one allow good guy to be unscathed. Its jealousy(immense natural resources)  eventually make people attack russia. Russia can not fight against bankers without start creating problem in europe clandestinely. I do not see any other way for russia to survive unless putin launch nuke attack early by creating their own false flag attack and blame it on USA.","Always reasonable friedman seems lost. Idea here is using UKRAINE as base to make russia implode without any cost for WEST.Capturing crimea would have been bonus. Thats why CIA spent 5billion to create Mass demonstration and coup in kiev. For me Putin is very restraint. He could have captured whole ukraine quickly and kill off all traitors in kiev and split ukraine into west ukraine and annex east and south ukraine. I really think putin must do that to protect russia. Any attempt to unstablize russia should be crushed.  For me putin still wants to be with WEST and slowly improve russia inside out. I understand completely what putin wants. He wants stronger russia. Democracy is death knell of a country. It is actually a virus. It weakens country's nationalis and divide a country into million pieces.  Any enemy can take over a democratic country. Thats the WEST idea. USA is not democracy. All western countries have democracy not the USA. USA is controlling force , Not the OBAMA govt , republican and democrats. They are all just puppets (players in casino). USA has secret govt run by bankers.  World need to copy that style with secret govt of their own. In that it brings stability behind democracy mask.  I think russia needs secret govt full of nationalistic patriots. My belief is that WEST should not be allowed to have 100 power. Because anyone with 100 power is dangerous to rest of humanity. Russia should block this from happening even if russia has to be destroyed.","USA is attacking russia past 20 years. Encircling completly and stirring trouble by supplying finance to chechnya terrorists to NGO in russia. Idea is make russia implode and split it as many pieces so it can be controlled like european slave states at whims of cabal that runs USA. My guess is Putin do not want anything to with UKRAINE but WEST came too close for comfort for russia not to do anything. If RUSSIA do nothing , what is happening in ukraine will happen in russia next year and WEST will split russia. RUSSIA risk it and take all ukraine down.  if  that becomes world war III with nukes , so be it. Because if russia let it continue , there won't be russia in 2 years. Putin need to take strong role and go on attack and choke NATO. Russia should not back down from pre emptibve nukes because that is where things are moving. If russia back down , its russia as country will not exist in few years","Leaders in Ukraine will continue to provoke Russia to force russia to invade eastern ukraine and south ukraine. I believe russia may have to take over southern ukraine for the necessity of supporting crimea. Russia only looking for reason to convince themself that without taking down ukraine , security of russia is not guranteed.  From my view point , its sinister attempt by WEST to attack russia using ukraine as NATO base.  If i am putin i will not attack ukraine but undermine its economy with spies until people raise up against Western bankers austerity measures."
Sam,,,,Putin is a character that is for sure.,"In an official statement, Putin claimed that And, certainly, the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy...This logic simply makes no sense, but of course he's pinning the blame on Ukraine, as he brings the black box back to Moscow...Putin's making it very clear that he has no intentions of backing down or reconciling with Ukraine.","This is all Merkels fault. She instigated the political breakdown in Ukraine by making empty promises all in the pursuit of an ever growing ego now the size of Putins. She thinks she controls the Euro-zone and wants a European Union that exists and operates as one nation effectively governed by Germany. However once she fully realizes the extent of her countrys dependency on Russian energy, she backs out on her promises to the Ukrainians...And now Putin is emboldened; in the US, the politics are so shambolic that the Republicans call the president weak for not acting, and the Democrats demand a response. The press is private and profit based that it simply appeases its targeted user bases and passes along the unfiltered propaganda that is really no different from its cousin in Russia, but simply termed differently...The situation therefore escalates as Putin senses indecision from the US president. Meanwhile Ukraine is thrown into a crisis as people are needlessly killed and tensions develop. The world moves towards a possible world war all over egos of a bunch of politians who are less than .000000000000000001 of the population on earth.","Hey Neil, where'd you get your info to write this nonsense?.I just came from Russia - 85 of the population adore Putin and support him all the way. At the same time they despise Obama and America, insofar as he remains America's face. I'm not saying the Russians are right or that they haven't been brainwashed,  but those are the facts on the ground and I don't know where you get yours. From Brighton Beach nursing homes?",Putin's days of suffocating neighbors into submission are over.,,,,,

james,,,,"Mr. Putin's actions merit nothing but condemnation, but we should be wary of the rosy picture Mr. Friedman presents of the Ukraine. For a quarter century, the Ukraine has had industrial levels of corruption as Mr. Friedman acknowledges. Now, they want European and American money. Of course, they're passing laws and regulations, but what is the likelihood they will be enforced? We all know about tax laws, business regulations, and the millions of loopholes that pepper both. We should work towards containment of the Russians and infuse some sense of reality in the Ukraine. The deep problem here is that while some in the Ukraine might yearn to be part of the West, we all know that a Europe in crisis and an America deeply engaged in other parts of the world -- Asia, the Near East -- is not prepared to pay the pricetag (and should not have to) for Ukrainian aspirations. European citizens are regularly hectored on fiscal responsibility, Americans are told to tighten our belts, why should the Ukraine get a free pass (at our expense) for nearly a generation of corrupt rule? Why should we believe that it is over, and that our cash, credit, assistance, and guarantees will go anywhere but into a black hole of graft, kickbacks, waste (and a lot of it will likely find its way to Russia)? I say stay the course: continued chaos will bleed Russia, and Friedman's notion that Russia will start World War III to raise the price of oil seems more deranged than Putin's conduct.","Mr. Friedman, in the 1980s were the Sandinistas trying to host Russian missiles or join the Warsaw pact?  They threatened some quite limited US economic interests, and promoted a more egalitarian ideology that, if it spread, might threaten some more interests.  We unleashed an ugly clandestine war with hired killers, assassinations and covert operations, and we supported even bloodier repression in neighboring El Salvador. Mr. Putin is responding to encirclement by the West, and he has no illusions about how the West acts to advance its own geopolitical interests. I find little or nothing about Mr. Putin's regime attractive, but it seems willfully naive to ignore the larger historical context for his vision of US intentions. And, I'm just tired of hearing about the corrupt Russian oligarchs, as I live in a country where, patently, political office and legislation are sold to highest bidders.","The west's actions or inactions have contributed to violent chaos and economic hardship in country after country where there were promising popular movements or promises of democracy.  I have no love for Mr. Putin or for his repressive and corrupt policies at home, and cynical actions abroad. Western leaders and the western press (often cheerleaders for Iraq, remember), though, are the ones playing a dangerous game here, glossing over the deep corruption within the Ukrainian system, the history of the Crimea -- annexed to the Ukraine by the Soviet Union in 1954, and the legitimate interests of Russia to maintain order in a region heavily populated by Russians and linked by treaties to Russian military bases.  The long history of US intervention in our near abroad and our far abroad makes some prudence and restraint, even rhetorical restraint, well advised.  We should be looking for a way to gloss over the Russian invasion, seeing it as an effort by the closest power to maintain order, and finding a constructive way to reach a solution that recognizes Russia's important interests in the region.","It sure is fortunate that countries dealing with the US don't have to worry about anything like American exceptionalism, messianic fervor, or religious and historic missions.  That would make the world a messy place, wouldn't it?  It's not all about Putin or about leaders.  Russia was badly defeated and humiliated (in its estimation) at the end of the Cold War, and history provides many examples -- the Confederacy and Germany after World War I come to mind -- of the dangerous things that follow the trauma of defeat and the overturning of a society.  What troubles me, among other things, is that we Americans seem unwilling to recognize how flawed our potential Ukrainian allies are and how great a potential there is for bloody carnage without a strong force imposing order which we obviously cannot do.  Remember all those Iraqis supposedly yearning for democracy of the Jeffersonian kind?  Where are they now?  Were they ever there?  We heard a lot about them from David Brooks back in the day.","The EU is having a hard time maintaining living standards for its members (been to Greece lately, Mr. Friedman?) or controlling right-wing extremists within its own countries or sometimes leading them (check out Hungary).  Perhaps it should concentrate on its own house before holding out the false promise of integration to Ukraine, something no one will be able to manage or afford anytime soon. Is Mr. Putin really the one introducing spheres of influence into this? This is exactly what the US has been doing -- in a completely ham-handed way -- by stoking the uprising in the Ukraine.  It wasn't just the last pro-Russian -- and elected -- government that was corrupt there. Corruption has run deep in previous governments and in the economic structure of the country. Please, too, Mr. Friedman, stop peddling your invented geographies. It sounds ominous to say that a region was called New Russia by the czars in the 19th century, and then term it a region of southeastern Ukraine. But, what makes this, in your view, southeastern Ukraine? Both sides are drawing their own atlases as if national and cultural boundaries were fixed in stone or set forever at one particular era of one side's preference. So-called New Russia was under Russian rule for well over two centuries -- longer than most of the US has been ruled by Europeans. Want to undo that, Mr. Friedman? Before that, it was part of the Muslim Tartar khanate, a state which, curiously, no one is looking to revive.","It sure is fortunate that countries dealing with the US don't have to worry about anything like American exceptionalism, messianic fervor, or religious and historic missions.

IPI,,,,It is a shame that the US cannot move beyond a Cold War mentality that constantly seeks to isolate and vilify Russia...If you invade and annex territories of your neighbors and otherwise terrorize them you deserve to be isolated. In the case of Cyprus there is also a large dose of hypocrisy and irony because Russia did to Ukraine what Turkey did to Cyprus. For the Greek Cypriots (or at least their president) to now support Putin shows the moral bankruptcy of their position.,"I suspect that Putin has helped create the very creature that will try to eat him...If I thought the article is correct and Kadyrov is really out of control I would agree with you. Unfortunately, I suspect Putin is using Kadyrov (in a carefully controlled way) as a prop in a good cop bad cop routine. Remember that Putin gave him a medal the day after it was revealed Kadyrov's men were arrested to the murder of Nemtsov (and a day after Kadyrov praised the arrested men).","Last year the pipeline was going to go through Bulgaria, now it is Turkey and in three years time it will probably go through Iran.

Alexander B.,,,,"It will definitely help us here in Moscow if Pres. Obama won't meet him and won't cooperate on Syria...Mr. Putin fiercely defends Syrian President Bashar Assad - almost irrationally.

And he is making crazy bets - hoping it will buy him time as his policies bring our country deeper in isolation and closer to full-blown crisis in the economy.","He is delusional, and it is frightening...Prior to his speech a bunch of islamists stormed the capital of Chechnya - and news about them entering local school reminded the bloodshed in Beslan school, the one Putin used to strip us of the rights to directly elect governors...(I wonder how the fact that islamists were able to enter the city of Grozny downtown so easily is connected to the curious fact that pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine wear same brown uniforms that Chechen guardsmen do)...Putin vowed to ease taxes and government pressure on business. As he did in 2013, 2012, 2011... each and every 11 years he was addressing the parliament. ..He proposed an amnesty for those businessmen who would return the money from off-shore jurisdictions - right at the moment when the owner of one of the largest independent oil companies is returning it to the state, while sitting on a house arrest and there are rumors that his second asset, largest russian wireless carrier, MTS (NYSE:MBT) is next...And, as the icing on a cake, Rouble lost another 0.80 just in 2 hours he was speaking...Annual inflation is 10, I clearly see signs of street crime return; and I don't see any slightly pleasant way out of this mess.

I have read that there are already protests in Kiev from Mothers demanding that Poroshenko agree to the surrender so the troops can be save. I read that there are about 5000 men trapped in there.","You hear different things from each source. However, there is no question that the situation is disparate for those soldiers stuck in the town. I doubt that anything will stop the firing. This will have to be settled on the ground. No amount of words and signed documents will have any effect on the fighting...Both sides see this as an existential battle, so it will have to play out. What is so stupid is that I understand that during the night of the talks in Minsk, Poroshenko was warned about the situation in Debaltsevo and that was the subject of most of the talks. According to what I have read Putin told him that his troops were encircled and Poroshenko kept going out and calling his general who told him the road was wide open.

But since you ignore their publications, and speeches you that false conclusion...You talk about an MLRS attack on Mariupol , but never write about children killed on playgrounds by Ukrainian artillery or how Ukraine deliberate shells  schools and hospitals etc...When this conflict first started back with Nuland cookies, the DPR did not exist. Leaders asked for Federalization. They were ignored. No one talked to them and very little formal military opposition. In fact Kiev army forces often joined them, surrendering their equipment. DNI forces continued to capture military hardware as Kiev units deserted leaving everything behind. Kiev soldiers fled over the border to Russia seeking asylum...Then Kiev launched harsh military actions against them using punisher battalions and troops from W. Ukraine. Now it was a full blown civil war. The demand was no longer federalism, but independence. They have said they don't want to join Russia, but they don't want to be under the control of the EU via Kiev...A peaceful solution will grant independence and stop the fighting. The US should make Kiev see reason in this matter and not continue to try to conquer and slaughter their own citizens. Kiev will win no hearts and minds with that approach. Does the US understand both sides in this conflict? I don't think so.",Why should Putin come to the table? He is not directing the Separatist forces in Ukraine. How about we start talking ot Zakharchenko and Plotnitsky who are actually directing the military campaign against Kiev. We need to find out what they want if we ever expect to have peace in Ukraine. We can't ignore them and pretend they don't exist. Kiev's refusal to listen to them back in March and April is what got us here today. So maybe John Kerry should think about talking to them instead of toe Lavrov - I know it would hurt his pride - but he needs to swallow that if he wants peace.,"This is NOT Mr. Putin's war. It is a Ukrainian war and it is Ukrainian who are fighting and dying. Kiev is looking and receiving arms from NATO countries (but once more advanced one from the US). and the soldiers of the DNI are getting some military aid from Russia...We have military trainers and advisors in Ukraine ( we send Military personal and CIA to advise Kiev). Thus it can just as well be called Mr. Obama's war as well as you can call it Mr. Putin's war...The editorial board has taken a position based on talking or listening to those who talk to the government in Kiev. I have yet to read a report of ANY US OFFICIAL talking to Mr. Zakharchenko or Plotnitsky. Why not? They are the ones conducting the war on the opposition side - but no one wants to talk to them. Why is that? ..When we negotiate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict we talk to both sides. Why can't we talk to both sides in this conflict. And NO Russia is NOT one of the sides in the conflict. The conflict is between 2 oblasts and Kiev government. Yet like an Ostrich we stick out head in the sand and refuse to talk to the opposition to Kiev. ..If we truly want peace, we will not supply Kiev with weapons, and WE (i.e. John Kerry) can talk to both Kiev and DonetskLugansk and try to understand their needs as well as Kiev. It is only when we talk to both sides that we can start on the road to peace...Editorials like this DO NOT contribute to Peace - only make war more bitter and more likely to spread.","Wow have you tried reading something that other than the NYT that does not have the fingerprints of the US government all over it...How about really learning what the other side wants and I don't mean Putin - I mean that the people in Donetsk and Lugansk who just want freedom from Kiev. They are fighting for their Independence - you know the right of Self-determination which is in our Constitution, the UN charter and Wilson's 14 points.","Putin has made his next move - Today Russian immigration services announced it would grant Ukrainian men of conscript age 90 day permits, extendable every 90 days, to stay in Russia. Poland has announced that it will not grant visas to Ukrainian males of conscript age. ..Kiev has called for a new round of mobilization and conscription. This will be the 5th such round. The Kiev Ministry of Justice has announced severe punishment for anyone caught evading conscription. Reports in a variety of sources say many young men are fleeing the country to avoid military service. In fact one article said one town rented a bus to move all those eligible for conscription over the border to Russia...While some may attribute this to Russian propaganda the actions of the Kiev government, published in the Kiev Post leads one to believe that there has to be some truth to tales of desertions and young men fleeing the country to avoid conscription.  ..Neither side in this conflict is honest about losses. Both sides minimize their own losses and magnify those of their opponents. But Kiev' call for a 5th round of Mobilization indicates high casualties. Baltic countries are accepting most seriously injured for rehabilitation as such treatment not available in Kiev.

Putin told Poroshenko that his troops were surrounded. Poroshenko kept calling his generals who assumed him that was not true and they were resupplying the military and had a road open to Debaltsevo. Since there was no agreement, they just left the topic out of the Minsk Agreement and apparently decided to let it be settled on the ground...This was all thoroughly reported in papers in the UK, France and Germany.",Actually they talked about Debaltsevo for 8 Hours - in short all night. Putin told Poroshenko his troops were surrounded  and Poroshenko kept calling his military and they assured him that the Ukr. Army was no surrounded and was easily resupplied.  Well obviously Putin was right and Poroshenko was lied to.

Weakened, it shifted into a more polarized dynamic, allowing Russia the chance to intercede and stake a claim once again...Mr. Putin thinks Russia is entitled to the Ukraine because of the past.  He forgets why Russia lost it to begin with.  But now with Crimea in Russian clutches, what's next?  Just look back on history, and remember how the USSR was created.  Putin is very likely to follow the same blueprints.  The only way to effectively resist his plans is to help these targeted nations to overcome their economic struggles and be strong enough such that Russia can't cultivate inner support and weaken them.","Under what circumstances would this Editorial Page support military assistance to the Ukrainians?.Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and USA Today all support..There is massive, bi - partisan support in Congress to arm Ukraine.  Not just from the McCain's,  but Dick Durbin, Barbara Boxer and Robert Menendez as well..What are you guys thinking over there?  Do you believe it is OK to disarm a nation of their nuclear deterrant (as we did to Ukraine in 1994), make security assurances and then stand by as the country gets run over by Russian tanks?.Have you thought of the long term ramifications of  denying assistance and allowing the utter destruction of a peaceful country that we were sworn to protect?.Why don't we revisit this conversation when Putin is in the Baltics, Poland or Berlin...","Inhabitants of eastern Ukraine must be the only people on earth clamoring to be part of Putin's kleptocracy.

But if it ends up feeding and supplying the Russian Separatists fighting the Ukranians it's military aid regardless of what Putin calls it, even if there's no weapons in that shipment...If this is indeed what Putin plans, he's trying to score a great propaganda victory, appearing to be sending humanitarian aid and turning the world against the Ukranians for denying this shipment, while actually supplying his troops.","The Ukraine has long had a very close relationship with Russia.  Both countries are dependent upon each other.  Russia salvaged the war torn Ukraine after WII and helped rebuild it into the country it has ultimately become.  Does that give Russia the right to reclaim it after secession from the dissolved USSR?  Apparently Russia believes it can take Crimea, based on the public polls showing a vast majority of citizens preferring to be part of Russia instead of the Ukraine...Crimea is going to be annexed to Russia.  No doubt about it.  But the big question is, what will happen to the Ukraine?  If Putin finds it was so easy to take back Crimea, perhaps Eastern Ukraine will be next on his target.  But for that to happen... it will be much more difficult. It will require another 5 years of subterfuge, manipulating people and events within the region.","Putin is the most powerful thug in Russia. He is a master manipulator, in the sense that he is effective... despite being obvious for what he is to people outside of his control.  Russia's manipulation of the Ukraine is a classic textbook example of brazen oppression and subjugation, masquerading as stability and order...When you recognize the extreme significance of the Ukraine to the Russian economy, as well as strategic importance, there can be no doubt that Russia has an enormous vested interest in this region.  They were just waiting for some internal instability to upset the lopsided relationship Russia has with the Ukraine (Russia gets the much better deal). All the while, they were massaging portions of the population with propaganda for years, because without their cooperation Russia would have to make an all out invasion with weapons blazing...I sincerely hope that Natalka Sniadanko's prediction will come true, that the Russian propaganda will dissipate in wake of reality and leave Putin with only two choices:  Pull out or brazenly defy international law with a war.  The USA invades countries at will was Putin's claim. The USA had made mistakes in the past, so Putin feels he's entitled to do the same? Every invasion circumstance is unique. There is no tangible comparison between Iraq and the Ukraine.  I'm mystified as to why Putin is not officially called out for his distortion of reality, as Angela Merkel of Germany put it.","Ukrainians eventually proved adept at partisan warfare against the German army in WWII. Watch for a protracted conflict if the same tactics are employed against the Russians. This may be Putin's Vietnam. ..Meanwhile, what does Russia gain?

I am no fan of Putin but this was not hard to foresee...That Russia gains traction in the EU only means that the EU needs to clean up its shop in many ways. Britain would be going too far if it left the union but it worked much better as an economic and customs union as the EEC and EC. ..As for the West's moral decline ? Well, nobody wins on that score but the West is showing signs of having peaked on many fronts. Or rather it always did - just didn't have competition as it does now.","Why am I not surprised.  Too many readers here, like Merkel and Hollande cheered another ceasefire.

You can't negotiate with no chips - it's Negotiation 101.","I must say that to label Mr. Putin as Czar is erroneous.  He needs to known as Party Secretary Redux.  Why? The last czar, Czar Nicholas, was terribly unpopular throughout his empire; Putin is not.  Imperial Russia lacked internal cohesion; Russia does not.  The productive assets of imperial Russia (e.g., oil) were reaching world markets because of fledgling multinationals (e.g., Royal Dutch Shell); Russias gas in reaching a dependent Europe as a consequence of GazProm.  The czars military was weak  it was knocked out of  WWI very quickly; Putin has a well-organized, well-equipped military and many deliverable megatons of thermo-nuclear MAD.  While his cousin, Wilhelm, was likely mentally ill, the Czar was not; Mr. Putin on the other hand?  Certainly, Mr. Putin is the most dangerous man in the world today, if one considers his ability to take unilateral action, the weight of his arsenal of deliverables and his mental status.","You realize that we can have diplomacy while supplying lethal arms to Ukraine right?  They are not mutually exclusive...In fact, Putin is supplying thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks to the rebels and it doesn't seem to be preventing him from engaging in diplomacy.  Seems to be rather helping his negotiating posture instead.",Putin probably is probably laughing at NATO's and Obama's response.  He should probably take a strong leader's warning in Erdogan more seriously though.,"The fact is NATOEUUSA did continue to encroach into Russia's sphere of influence and interests since the fall of the Soviet Union, and the coup against a democratically elected Ukraine government did not, obviously, sit well with the Kremlin.  Given the circumstances, did anyone expect Russia to sit by and watch Ukraine drift towards NATO with a government hostile to Russia and to the Russian speaking population of Ukraine?  The fact that some German politicians agree with the facts does not make them anti-Western or hypocritical.  Germany also had significant economical and investment interests to protect, and they are trying to balance their interests with a solution to the problem of Ukraine as a nation that is falling into civil war.  I don't think they are pandering to Putin at all, they are doing what any other nation would do to protect their interests.  The US and other EU countries do not have as much invested in Russia as Germany, and can continue to exert economic sanctions to pressure Putin, but I don't think blaming Germany for their dealings in this situation does any good.","Spinning like a centrifuge and gazing into the distant future via his crystal ball ...

You cannot say , can you ? ..You see we will never know since opposition forces ( which included the good old U.S.of A. ) who overthrew the democratically elected Ukraine government would not agree to settle things peacefully and democratically with an early  fresh national election .

ReaderNYC,,,,"The Ukrainian government is involved in a punitive operation against its own citizens - it should have been clear long ago when it called its military operation in the East an Anti-Terrorist Operation. And even before that when it tried to crush peaceful resistance against the Maidan revolution - that according to opinion polls is widespread in the South and the East - by sending heavily armed far-right extremist militias...The precedent of carving out parts of Ukraine is not necessarily catastrophic for the operation of international law in Europe. Russias annexation of Crimea was not, as is often claimed, the first attempt since 1945 to move European borders by military force. Borders have been forcibly changed in the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus and the frozen conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan. And then there was the breakup of the Soviet Union itself that gave birth to Ukraine just 20 years ago...Putin is hated because he acts like a leader of his people who has real power in the world. Geopolitics is far more complicated than the news suggests and within that context he is acting no different than every other leader in the world, including Obama. The only difference? Our media has a vested interest in not telling us all the Obama does around the world and telling us everything they possibly can about what Putin does.","Someone please explain to me how Putin is the evil but Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko - the leader of the bloody suppression of the rebels fighting for independence - ended up visiting our Congress rather then being detained for life in Hague?..Indiscriminate shelling of the East Ukrainian cities full of civilians by Ukrainian army and several anti-rebel paramilitary units has been widely documented by Amnesty International. How is Petro Poroshenko different from Assad?..I think I know how - he's our dictator!.As long as he's serving our goal of containing the resurgent Russia from raising its head in this world, Mr. Poroshenko doesn't need to worry about the International Criminal Court.","I have been following the events in Ukraine in various sources, and my opinion is that NYT coverage has been extremely one-sided. To be fair, there has been very little objective analysis or debate on the issue in any of the major publications. Notable exceptions are Stephen Cohen's articles in the Nation, Noam Chomsky, as usual, Rand Paul The majority of mainstream coverage reminds me of the pre-Iraq war drumbeat by the media intended to influence public opinion in support of the war. Remember what happened? After killing of more than half a mil of Iraqi people, mostly civilians, destroying countrys infrastructure, plunging the country into political chaos, the government admitted it was a mistake. Are we preparing to make another one? Who would benefit from it? We are cranking up the defense budget at the expense of more investment in healthcare and education. We are antagonizing one country after another. Doesnt this perpetuate the terrorist threat to our own citizens? Is all this truly in the interest of the American people?

Have we not had enough war and bloodshed in the world that we should continue to root for more hardline measures.  By arming Kiev with lethal weapons would only lead to more violence and not peace.

Rose,,,,"Sending additional  arms to Ukraine will not stop Putin to support separatists, and will not decrease his support in Russia. Quite opposite will happen: escalation of military conflict.

And less and less Ukrainian soldiers will be willing to risk their lives in this civil war.

It looks very much like America is moving into the 21st Century, led well by this President.  Putin's Russia is indeed mired in something like a 19th Century mentality. ..When experts in the Republican Party become hyper-reactive to a thug like Putin, they do not realize they are allowing him to drag them down and back ward, onto his playing field where he determines the rules.  ..For six years we've watched Republicans hyper-react to President Obama.

Cormac,,,,"So your argument that Russia has any fundamental interest at all comes down to the assertion - not the fact, but the assertion - by Putin that Ukrainian membership in NATO is a threat to Russia's territorial security and sovereignty...But does that stand up?..NATO has started no wars, ever.  It repeatedly rebuffed Ukrainian membership in NATO and gave Putin multiple promises on the topic - promises it continues to honor even now.  THe Ukraine itself agreed to set aside the idea of joining NATO, only reversing course AFTER Putin invaded...This just doesn't pass the laugh test.  It isn't NATO or defensive concerns that triggered Putin's actions, it was the EU, democracy and fears of an open society on his borders.  Putin will only feel safe if Ukrainians aren't free.  That is not a legitimate demand any country can make upon another.","Why the heck should we help militarize an already fragile state on Russia's border?..1. Because this is the FOURTH time Putin has done this to a neighboring state in the last 20 years or so.  We already tried staying out and it just makes him more brazen.  It logically follows that staying out again will simply mean facing him in Latvia next.  (What will YOU say then?)..2. Because we made a commitment in the 1994 Budapest Agreement to protect Ukraine's borders.  If we betray it, we will have a lot of trouble convincing other nations or rebel groups to trust us - thereby increasing the likelihood of war in the future...This is a straight case of pay some now or pay more later.  Every dollar, soldier, and unit of political capital Putin spends in Ukraine is one he can't spend in the next planned conquest.","You don't have to be a fan of Putin to see that the West has pushed NATO hard to the East...Actually, you do.  NATO has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine on this front and shown great good faith to the Russians when they objected to the idea back when...Hey Mr Cohen, imagine if the Russians were funding the leaders of a coup in Mexico with arms and tanks.....Actually, to make your analogy work, we should imagine that we invaded Mexico, unilaterally declaring 11 of the country to be New USA and then sending in troops and arms to destabilize another big chunk.  Now imagine that we had specifically promised just a few years before to never do such a thing if the Mexicans unilaterally disarmed and they had.  And also that the Russians likewise promised Mexico that they would help protect it if it disarmed.  ..I can't speak for Cohen, but under such circumstances, I think I would support the Russian's sending the Mexicans guns.",That is his point.  Belarus has become the exact kind of puppet state that Putin envisions for Ukraine.,"...for some time now I have been wondering why the eastern part of Ukraine is worth so much blood and capital...It is, or was, the manufacturing base of the country.  An outsized share of the industrial infrastructure was there.  It wasis widely believed that it would be difficult to build an economically viable nation state if you didn't have either it or Crimea.  A key reason for the Russian grab.  Also, like Crimea, the are borders a section of the Black Sea believed to have vast oil deposits - which could help Ukraine become independent of Russian energy, a key stick of Russian foreign policy. ..Ukraine could have a truly fresh start if they considered the wishes of the people in the eastern part of the country. If those people would rather be a part of Putin's Russia, then a deal should be struck...Perhaps if, but the fact is they don't.  The upraising was initially led by Russian soldiers and  is entirely an affair of a minority with guns forcing its views on the majority of the Dombass populace who preferred to be part of the Ukraine.  (Many of those people have fled the violence at this point, so there is also a question of whether you let people with guns steal the land of the law abiding.)..There is nothing inherently sacrosanct about borders. ..Exactly what worries the Ukrainians, who gave up their nukes for promises from Russia that their borders WOULD be sacrosanct.","I'm not sure what media you watch.  In the US, the major daily newspapers and TV networks have repeatedly said that Putin's goal is to destabilize Ukraine and that he would be really reluctant to invade, but allow for the fact that the man is unpredictable, unprincipled, and in the grips of a retrograde romantic vision that has led him to do self-destructive things before...To any reasonable observer it seems obvious his restraint comes from the likely consequences of an invasion - a long, drawn out, violent occupation and a disastrous economic cold war.",,,,

Putin is nothing, if not an autocrat, and one with a Napoleon complex to boot...It might be wise to talk about the merits of the case and not this constant comparing of the West's (most especially American politics and foreign policy).

So, all our traditional adversaries (Russia, Iran, North Korea, ISIS, Cuba) will use the last year and a half of Obama's presidency to gain as much ground as they can, knowing there is no leader of the free world who has any intention of reining them in.","No, Betsy Herring,.Our European (and other) allies have given up on Obama. They realize he's a confused weakling and have lost all respect for him.  But that is fine with me. Let them build up their own militaries and take action in their own behalf for a change. But there is one concern: whether Obama's abandonment of our allies will go so far as to fail to meet NATO obligations (such as defending the Baltic states if Putin chooses to move in). That would be a level of weakness that is unacceptable and Obama is raising concerns that he may in fact have descended to that level.  I'll take any one of those Republican crash dummies over that level of weakness.

A very different matter.","Almost as mysterious as the disappearance of a large commuter jet is the reporting coming out of both Moscow and Washington about Russia's retaking of the Crimea.  Does Putin really count it a victory to have lost the Ukaine and taken as a consolation prize a piece of real estate on which he held a long-term lease in any case?  Is the U.S., now wringing its hands in public, not celebrating behind closed doors a major victory in having engineered the conquest of a nation that conservatives like Zbigniev Brezhinski long coveted as the fulcrum to power in Europe?","Having watched Putin's speech in its entirety on RT.com, (Just as an aside, one has to wonder how long U.S. cable channels will continue to allow us access to Russia's version of the Voice of America), it is clear that Putin has clawed a victory from the crisis in the Ukraine.  In a somewhat provocative taunt at President Obama's stepping back from his own self-defined red lines, he made it clear that Russia would not compromise on its own lines.  Yet, he emphasized that, in taking over the Crimea, not a shot had been fired, contrasting Russia's moves with bellicose U.S. led actions going back to the bombing of Belgrade and continuing on through Libya, an early battle in what he called the Arab Winter.  If, as appears to be the case from the statements and behavior of neo-conservative hawks like Secretary Nuland, the U.S. had a hand in engineering the coup in Kiev, it would suggest that the Nobel Peace Prize winner in the White House needs to take stock.  For, among the many disappointments that his reign in office has elicited none has been so startling as his seamlessly maintaining just about all of his predecessor's foreign and domestic national security policies.  Even the drawing down of the U.S. presence in Iraq and Afghanistan fail to provide an exception since those policies were a foregone conclusion after the Iraqi War Commission essentially reined in the disastrous excesses of the so-called BushCheny cabal.","It is somewhat ironic that Putin has made his offer while in Mongolia.  Basically off the radar of the mass media in the West, the former soviet republic of Mongolia is crawling with various manifestations of American influence--from the Peace Corps to a substantial U.S. military presence.  In fact, rather amazingly, Mongolia hosts both Russian and U.S. joint military exercises.  Mongolia, like Ukraine, may be viewed as a buffer state between various spheres of influence and this has taken place without violence or the threat of violence from either side.  A vast territory of great beauty, Mongolia might well serve as a model to be replicated in Ukraine.","Just weeks ago, a variant on the headline, Seeing Cost of Saber Rattling in Ukraine, Putin Alters Course, might easily have read Seeing Cost of Saber Rattling in Ukraine, Western Powers Alter Course.  As it stands, the headline draws a conclusion that to most careful observes is patently baseless.  What actually led Putin to alter course is a mystery, but clearly something happened.  The man who addressed his government after he issued a request that his right to call out the army be rescinded by parliament--a strange outcome by any measure--was very obviously a changed man from the spunky, assertive leader who had in his first speech on the crisis spoke out so boldly on everything from Nuland's giving out doughnuts in the Maidan to the U.S. attempt to completely take over the Russian economy in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. For opponents of American hegemony, the first speech was ear candy.  It is impossible to know whether we will ever be made privy to what took place between Speech A and Speech B, but the near-perspiring delivery and near-platitudinous calls for reason in the second speech made it all but certain that someone or something had taken a good deal of the strut out of Putin's walk.  The change was so dramatic that it could lead one to wonder whether the leverage employed might have been of a personal nature rather than driven by purely political considerations.  All this, of course, may be written off as speculation, but one can't help wondering.","I find it hilarious when Western leaders complain of Putin's being trapped in 19th-century thinking.  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the West, led of course by the U.S., has made every effort to restore global politics to the status quo pro ante.  And the effort has not been restricted to that sphere alone, as Western economies have not been able to bury fast enough or deep enough not just socialism but even the welfare state that dates back to Bismark in Germany.  Laissez-faire capitalism, privatization across the board, the destruction of unions and governments led by a new quasi-monarchical arrangement under the aegis of corporate rule are the hallmarks of the so-called new world order.  In fact, the nineteenth century as a goal may be an underestimation; the eighteenth or even the thirteenth often seem the goal.  Conservative authors are still nervous about the French revolution.  On the occasion of the fall of the Berlin wall, this newspaper gave space to Solzhenitsyn to opine that it was now beyond debate that liberty, equality and fraternity were irreconcilable.  Here in the U.S., the stipulations of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 seem a bit too radical, more than we can live with.",,,,

His denials publicly and strong propaganda at home will continue.  ..It's always about the back channels, and why what Putin says to European leaders privately is what matters.  He needs only assure them that no more of their citizens will be killed and that it was all just a tragic accident.  ..This is another example of how it's not what the US says but with whom it has relations.

Russia was particularly hard on Germany after the war. Berlin crisis, Berlin Wall, the DDR regime, everything is forgotten..This shameful, thuggish land grab is inexcusable . I don t recall USA took any land lately, so I don t understand the comparison. I am sure Putin is encouraged by his western friends and will move a little further west than he originally planned. With so much support, he will be greeted with open arms. Oh yes and Kaliningrad, land grab from after the war, will stay Russian indefinably.

Ken,,,,"Watch PBS' Frontline, Putin's Way, and you will get a chilling sense of this individual.  Unfortunately, our involvement of providing arms will only ramp up the hostility into a war we cannot win.  Give the Europeans the latitude to exhaust all peaceful alternatives for now.","Many reporters and commentators casually mention the warm-water naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea as being essential for Russia's national security interests. But I've been wondering why Russia can't (or simply won't) relocate its navy to somewhere just the southeast, along its own Black Sea coastline.  ..I found a partial answer to this question in a Wikipedia article on the Russian port of Novorossiysk:..In 2003, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree setting up a naval base for the Black Sea Fleet in Novorossiysk. Russia has allocated 12.3 billion rubles (about 480 million) for the construction of the new base between 2007 and 2012. The construction of other facilities and infrastructure at the base, including units for coastal troops, aviation and logistics, will continue beyond 2012...The Russian lease on port facilities in Sevastopol, which, though the main base of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, is part of Ukraine, was set to expire in 2017. Ukraine was reported to be planning to not renew the lease; however, in April 2010 the Russian and Ukrainian presidents signed an agreement to extend the lease by twenty-five years, with an option of further extension of five years after the new term expires...Perhaps the Ukrainians and the international community should pressure Russia to move its navy, as originally planned, out of Sevastopol and into the Russian port of Novorossiysk. That might actually help to decrease tensions in the region.","I do not believe Putin will stop at a land bridge.  He will keep going until Ukraine in its entirety is in Russian hands.  As David Brooks said, Putin is supplying arms to its proxies, now the west has to supply arms to its proxies.  Sanctions will be ineffective.  If Putin gamble pays off then Russia will continue expanding its influence wider than Ukraine.","Let's not forget that Fox had some left-of-center company on this one...Several frequent, left-of-center commenters on NY Times editorials and op-ed columns blamed the U.S., the E.U., andor NATO for Putin's takeover of Crimea and his thinly veiled war against Ukraine. They rationalized Putin's actions, and some even went so far as to positively support his revanchism...They were wrong on this particular issue, just like Fox and friends.",,,,,,
Luke W,,,,The Russians have the whip hand in this war. They don't have to invest a great deal of men and material just enough to keep the pot simmering thus keeping the Ukraine economy on its back.  ..Kiev thinks the EU and especially Germany with its deep pockets should pump money into their coffers but both the EU and Germany while giving lip service to Kiev have no intention of serious investment in such a corrupt shattered country at war. They might as well burn the money in an incinerator or bail out Greece to more effect. ..If Poroshenko is waiting for NATO and sanctions to ride to the rescue he may have a long wait. Moscow seems determined to make sure that Ukraine does not become a part of NATO and most if not all of NATO agrees with this. His best course is to meet with Merkel and Putin in a neutral location and hammer out an agreement.  ..The US should not be a part of these negotiations since this is primarily an eastern European matter and the Americans are incapable of being honest brokers over this issue because they have a different and more antagonistic agenda regarding Russia and will be happy to fight to the last Ukrainian.,"Putin is right.  The only way forward in Syria is via some facsimile of the Assad government and very likely eventually with someone more acceptable than Assad at the helm...Russia also wants to preserve their long standing influence and presence on Syria's Mediterranean coastline.  So yes Russia is stepping forward to protect a secular western directed Alewife mini-state that best serves their interest...America is hardly in a position to protest in that through their diplomatic and military incompetence we have been the largest foreign catalyst for the chaos in the region...We also support the duplicitous, vicious and despotic Saudi regime thus stripping away any moral stature we may have thought we had.  We are hypocrites of the worst kind and not in a position to lecture others.",Putin is currently riding very high in Russian public opinion. He cannot and will not tolerate a humiliation engineered by a sneering American...The Americans seem to be trying to make sure that there is no way out for him other than an embarrassing capitulation by ditching the separatist Russian speakers in the Donbas.  ..This is not Iraq or Afghanistan where we can diplomatically and militarily stumble and fumble about. And like Tom Friedman said yesterday not knowing what the hell we are doing...Russia is a power with a thermonuclear arsenal and has most of the conventional military chips on its side of the table if it elects to use them...Putin needs an escape hatch and not to be driven into a corner. The Germans who prefer not to destroy their economy to rescue a corrupt regime in Kiev or amuse a unaffected Washington should be the power that provides him with that escape hatch.,Friedman solidly represents the consensus view that while Putin may have scored a short-term victory he is bound to lose in the long run.  We merely have to be patient and wait for all Russians to come to their senses and submit themselves to the superior wisdom of the west lead by a hubristic America...Friedman well represents that smugness and both Russians and Chinese find it offensive and threatening.  With our thoughtless opportunism over the past decade vividly exhibited in Iraq and Afghanistan we may in fact as a consequence of our strategic ineptitude push the Russians and Chinese back together again to confront American pretensions.,,,,,,

I think rather that he himself is being intimidated by Schmitt's usual sources, the old  Cold War apparatchiks who still long for those good old days.","I assume, and I hope, Putin wasn't so tactless to remind Obama that the.War had alrady been won by June, 1944. The Russians, not we Americans.and our western allies, won it at Stalingrad the previous year. And isn't it.time, now that the Cold War is over, for the leaders of the West, including.the President of the U.S., to acknowlege that fact? Thankfully, D-day was.successful. Costly (as those pictures of the the cemetery at Omaha Beach.remind us) but a success. But imagine how much more bloody it would.have been had not Hitler's army been already destroyed in Russia. By the.Russians. How, if they had not already beaten the Nazis, could we have.won the WW2?   ..Think about it.","First of all, i wish the NYTimes would get out of the habit of referring to only by name someone the writer quoted a dozen or soparagraphs earlier. We're expected, apparently, to remember the name of someone we've never heard of before as well as what he said. Most of us, being human, can't, so we have to scroll back hunting for that name. And then we find that what that obscure individual had to say wasn't that important in the first place. Regarding the referendum, the people of East ukraine don't need anybody elses' permission to hold a vote to express their wishes. On anything, not only this question, whether to belong to Ukraine, Russia or neither., but on ony other question. That's called democracy. Which all these various outsiders, Obama, Putin et al, claim to support. Putin is the Bad Guy according to the NYT and the rest of Big Media, but he's the one desperately trying to find a peaceeful solution while Obama &amp; Co. encourages Kiev to try to crush the rebels by force. Which will, as they know full well, make negotiations impossible.",,,,,,

Ihor Broda,,,,"Putin had two goals at Minsk II:  preventing the US from sending lethal arms to Ukraine and preventing further economic sanctions against his plutocratic regime.   He achieved both...Your comment that sending lethal arms to Ukraine...would be an irresponsible and dangerous move in the current situation will cause Putin to smile and crack open the champagne.   Appeasement continues!..After this great victory, why would Putin withdraw non-existent troops and weapons?  He can continue this exercise in international Darwinism, knowing that the US and Europe will continue to bury their heads in the sand, hoping that this security crisis will go away.  The triumph of ostrichism.  ..Sadly, NATO emerges from Minsk II without a coherent unified vision of containing Putin.  NATO continues to operate under self-delusion that it is imperative for the West to keep his feet to the fire, as if his feet were ever put to the fire.  ..Minsk II is not only a bitter pill for Ukraine, but it can only cause continuing fear in Poland and the Baltic state that NATO is a paper tiger constantly outwitted by Putin.","The writer presents a well-reasoned rebuttal of Russian propaganda.  Unfortunately, many in the Western media have adopted the narrative that Ukraine is deeply divided.   Often they base this on maps which show which regions voted for deposed President Yanukovych, and use this as the basis for their conclusions without considering that he had used wedge issues to attract voters relying on propaganda and not truth.  The vote for Yanukovych was also a reaction to a poorly performing economy which resulted from a recession that started in 2008 in America and spread globally, including into Ukraine...Yanukovych negotiated with the EU for over 3 years and there was no great hue and cry from the regions which supported him.   He had in fact promised during the 2010 election campaign to move closer to Europe and the EU.   Russia countered with a propaganda campaign to discredit Europe as Gayropa.   The people who voted for Yanukovych did not vote for corrupt government that he delivered...The credibility of Russian propaganda should be assessed by the fact that Putin has virtually eliminated freedom of the press and put all media under his regime's control.  ..In Russia under Putin the first victim was the free press which had developed in the first decade after the collapse of communism,  and with that the resulting casualty of his regime is the truth.","Mr. Higgins mocks the reluctance to call a spade a spade by referring to it as the Russian whatchamacallit.  Interested readers can search Invasion on Wikipedia and decide to apply the duck test.  If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is probably a duck.  Admittedly, there are various types of ducks...The reluctance to use invasion mirrors the West's failure to send a strong message to Russia from the outset when Putin invaded Crimea.  Instead we saw incremental increases in sanctions, which are still very weak and not taken too seriously by Putin...Incrementalism and dithering over the whatchamacallit  only emboldens Putin to escalate, while having a good laugh with his fellow plutocrats about Western lack of unity, resolve and conviction.  Peace through Strength seems to be a forgotten concept having given way to words that are not backed up by action.  Two generations of cold warriors who have faded away can only cringe from on high, that containment has faded away with them.","Ross Douthat exhibits great insight into Putin's machinations both in Ukraine and Syria.  The last paragraph is prophetic as Putin is a wrecker whose military adventures bring no real benefit to his own people.  Putin is plucking wing feathers from Russia's two-headed eagle to add to his war bonnet while weakening the eagle. ..Putin's speech at the UN and in the media illustrate a clarion call with a ring of familiarity.  Dictators of the world unite!  The oppressed and exploited must never lose their chains!  His kleptocratic philosophy also has a familiar ring ; From each according to their servility.  To each according to their greed!..Putin is neither innovative nor creative and he simply follows the age-old formula used by Russian Tsars and commissars, to sustain themselves in power, by creating a besieged fortress state that must constantly fight off imaginary enemies.   To achieve this, Russians must be infected with delusions of imperial grandeur, and the belief that they are the messianic master race destined to be a great power...Regrettably, Russians continue to believe that military might is the sole criteria of greatness.  They have been conditioned to ignore other criteria such as:  individual rights and freedoms, economic power, quality of life, standard of living, rule of law, life expectancy, inter alia.  ..Mesmerized by illusory greatness they serve a state that does not serve them.","Another  piece from Russia which contains many common themes of Russian propaganda.   The author neglects to mention that in 1991,58 of the voters of Crimea supported Ukrainian independence, and this was before the later return of Crimean Tatars.   He completely ignores the Tatars, who historically have a much greater historical claim to Crimea and who overwhelmingly want to remain part of Ukraine, because they know they will be treated better by Ukraine than by Russia...The author displays typical Russian self-serving inconsistency, by supporting a Crimean referendum, and ignoring the people of the Caucuses which have opposed Russian occupation for centuries and in which Russia committed genocide against them.   To be consistent there should also be a referendum in Abkhazia and South Ossetia which were occupied by Russia in its war against Georgia in 2008...To be even more consistent he should also support a referendum in the Sakhalin Islands taken from Japan after WWII, where the indigenous peoples were Orientals and not Russians.   To this list we must add Konigsberg (since 1945 Kaliningrad) taken from the Germans and give them the right of self-determination.  ..Although the author finally admits that Russia has occupied Crimea, he completely omits the real reason which is Tsar Putin's desire to become emperor over a reconstituted Russian empire, perpetuating the illusion of grandeur. in order to keep his regime of crooks and thieves in power.","English author Samuel Johnson wrote, (False)patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.

Now to boost his flagging popularity he invades Ukraine, while at home his political oppenents condemn his regime a one of  crooks and thieves...As for his image building profession of Christianity, the last time I checked, none of the Ten Commandments had been repealed, nor has the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.","English author Samuel Johnson wrote, (False)patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.

Jews were historically the scape-goats to be blamed for imperial misrule and Ukrainians the bogeymen to be feared...It was tsarist Russia that passed the anti-Semitic May Laws and Tsar Nicholas II's secret police, the Okhrana, authored The Protocols of the Elders of Zion which were used to provoke pogroms by the Black Hundreds, which were equally  anti-Semitic and Ukrainophobic.  Nicholas II has been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church becoming the  defacto Patron saint of anti-Semitism.

He understands Putin's weaknesses, and also the fact that America can use its economic power to preserve global stability, without putting boots on the ground which a war-weary America does not support.  ..One important point he makes among many, is that Russia should be striving for greater economic integration with Europe , which  is the position of Russia's democratic opposition parties.  ..The reason Putin does not support becoming closer to Europe is that this would jeopardize the corrupt plutocracy's hold on power because Putin and his siloviki want to remain in power in perpetuity so they can continue to misappropriate Russia's wealth into their West European bank accounts...With the Crimean crisis,  the paranoia of Russia's elite and their frontman, has been shown to be based on deception and manipulation and it is difficult to understand whether or not they actually believe their own propaganda.  However, many average Russians have come to believe it, because Putin's regime has virtual control over the media. .. Hopefully, sooner rather than later they will realize that the emperor wannabe has no clothes.  The sooner they do, the better the chances for improved global security, and the better the chances for Russia becoming a more responsible and democratic country."
PogoWasRight,,,,"The cash I can understand.  The  Charm would have to be purchased from some other source, since Putin has none..............","Speaking of logic:  it appears to me that Putin and Russia have a much greater reason, if not 'right', to be in Crimea than we ever had to be in Iraq. Or Afghanistan for that matter.  Evidently, John McCain and all other Republicans and Tea Partiers will go to any length to blame some situation, somewhere, somehow, on Barack Obama.  Truly amazing!","Putin's aggressiveness and challenging attitude will be met by the rest of the world the same as the rest of the world met the same thinking and attitudes of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney: just be patient and Putin, too, will be gone from the world stage.  And forgotten like CheneyBush.......","Unfortunately, the worldview which John McCain, and many others espouse, is one which belongs and should remain in the 20th Century. The realism of challenge and confrontation and perceived weakness has no place in the 21st Century, even if Mr. Putin may not agree.  In this century, we will not be fighting another Pearl Harbor, but many more  World Trade Centers.  Events in Crimea will be what they will be - there should be no old-fashioned thinking of boots on the ground, and I do not believe that whatever the outcome there, it will have little effect on American credibility. Or its strength.","Unfortunately, McCain is objecting to Putin doing exactly what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It ain't easy being a politician....how can you keep your stories straight?  Especially if your mind is still in the 20th Century.","Sure, it was democratic.  Putin arranges it at the point of a gun, we arrange it with money - lots of money.  Same result.","Careful!  Be very careful!  When you speak of having a response ready to Putin in the Crimea, it scares the Hell out of me. I am old and have spent a career in the military, and been involved in several shooting wars.  Have You???.I know that when arm-chair pundits and advisors talk about response they have never carried a gun or lived in a foxhole or trench.  Please, let the Russina children and young men dig and live in the trenches of Ukraine, but leave my descendants and their friends alone for once!",,,
bkay,,,,"It's apparent that regarding levels of awarness and consciousness Pope Francis is far beyond Vladimir Putin.  Putin's mind is stuck in fear and ego, which by its very nature is devisive and destructive. Pope Francis, however, is more evolved thus he has a broader more positive perspective that seeks to uplift and unify.  As Maya Angelou wisely stated: I did then what I knew how to do.  Now that I know better, I do better.  Pope Francis knows better.  And that makes all the difference.","If these pro-Russian gunmen aren't really Russian military in disguise, who are they?  Are they supposed to be Pro Russia Ukranians?  Also, what maltreatment was happening in Ukraine to Russian-speaking Ukraneans that caused Putin to be motivated to come to their aid and go to the extreme of annexing Crimeia.  The entire mess is confusing.  Nothing is here nor there.  It's like dealing with a moving target.  Maybe that's why a wait and see attitude exists.  No one really knows what is going on and Putin isn't letting anyone know what he's up to and also denying that the militia are his.  His hands are clean. Trying to make sense of who belongs where and who wants to be Ukranian and who Russian complicates things even more.  But bottom line, it's more like Putin wants to take back a country he still believes belongs to him and is faking it till he makes it; until Ukraine becomes part of the New Russia as he mentioned.  If fairness and ethics ruled, there would have been a vote learning from the people themselves who they want to be and side with.","Mr. Putin is aware that the West values human life, human rights, and self-determination.  Even if we often fall short in the expression of those ideals ourselves.  Afterall, our verbal complaints about Russia invading Crimea had to do with just that, self-determination for the Crimeans. Thus, it appears as if  Putin is using those Western values as a distraction to get what he wants.  As if he's concluded his moves are somewhat okay, as long as they are perceived as being human rights based.  Afterall, Putin declared his main reason for going into Crimeia was to rescue Russian sympathizers from being maltreated by other Ukranians and their Western supporters--as if he really cared.  Nothing was ever mentioned about protecting the Russian navy base or port or anything else.  Instead, he attempted to pull the wool over the West's eyes by focusing on the human factor.  And It sounds as if Putin might be up to the same old ploy again regarding having his sights on the rest of Ukraine.  Even though we in the West want to consider Putin's call to President Obama as a positive sign, the entry on the Kremlin  web site indicates something different.  It shows that once again Putin is feigning human rights concerns regarding Russian speakers in Kiev and other areas of Ukraine.  Thus, while it's good to encourage communication between us and Russia, it's also important to remain cautious of this wolf in sheeps clothing cloaking himself in human rights concerns.","Putin, a proud, egoic, somewhat insecure person, will only dig in his heels, as we've observed, whenever he feels punished or otherwise treated like a misbehaving child.  And that's what sanctions do.  They are like putting a child in time out without dinner.  Appropriately dealing with Putin, so that communication can include sharing of views, changing of minds, and being  productive, requires that his temperment, his views and perspectives be respectfully listened to and understood.  In this way positive jam-breaking communication rather than reactionary digging in heels can rule.  In that way, a conclusion that most everyone can agree to can more easily be reached.  Afterall, Putin is a flawed human first, as we all are, then Russia's leader driven to restore Russia to its former glory and greatness...Unfortunately, we in the West have overreacted, pulled rank, and pulled out the punishment card.  We have a habit of doing that.   In this situation, however, that's sorely counterproductive.  And it's mind boggling that the other side wants to go even further, as they usually do, regardless the lessons that should have been learned from Iraq, and elsewhere.","Metaphorically speaking, Ukraine's European v Russia issue could be seen in the framework of a divorced ex-wife of Russia's Putin.  The ex wife, named Ukraine, though somewhat confused, basically wants freedom and self-determination.  But she lacks the power structure, stability, and economics to completely cut ties; to go her own way; to tell ex husband Putin to take a hike.  And because ex husband Putin is determined to get her back, he decides to overtly and covertly capitalize on her many weaknesses to achieve that end.  And despite her own beliefs regarding her legitimate rights, Putin believes differently.  He believes once his; always his.  He also believes all is fair in love and war.  And that includes, but isn't limited to, lying, being deceptive, and fierce intimidation using like-minded others, regardless what her friends or anyone else thinks or does attempting to deter him.  His aims remain undeterred.  To take back what he believes is already his.","Putin is partially driven by ego.  He's still reeling from the humiliation of the USSRs demise and the forced departure of his buddy Viktor Yanukovych from Uktaine. Thus, punishment in the form of sanctions and public reviling by the West regarding his audacity to ignore the rights of a soverign nation, only increases his rebellion.  Only causes him to become more crafty in his sneaky attemps to get what he wants...Putin simply can't tolerate the prospect of an EU-aligned Ukraine...of Europe and America meddling in his backyard...of the erosion of Russia's buffer zone..of Western incursion into Russia's sphere of influence...Getting throught to Putin's ego, without further damaging it, is the biggest challenge.  But one thing for sure, he must not feel cornered.  He must not look like a loser.  He must subtly be proved a way out, with ego intact.  And that will take finesse and be a challenging thing to do.","Putin is apparently a small man with a huge ego.  And ego can be an enormous driving force.  That at least explains in part the reason for Russia's incursion into Ukraine.  In his memoir, Putin reportedly laments that the USSRs demise was a personal humiliation.  The whole country no longer exists, it disappeared, he wrote...Then came the forced departure of pro Russian president Viktor Yanukovych.  Another blow to Putin's self-image and to Russia's self interest.  Next, Crimea.  Which showed that Putin will use force to get what he wants. ..And there seems to be no measure that will slow him down neither sanctions nor the reviling of his capacity to ignore the rights of a soverign country.  His response is to pull out the stops using lies and pretense including decoy humanitrian aid convoys; Russian troops sans Russian uniforms; and any other sneaky option he can come up with.  His behavior is reminicent of a juvenile trying to pull the wool over the eyes of a strict parent...Underneath it all though, is considerable vanity and vindictiveness. And even fear. Putin simply can't tolerate the prospect of an EU-aligned Ukraine:  what he sees as America and Europe meddling in Russia's backyard; erosion of Russia's buffer zone; and Western incursion into Russia's sphere of influence...Yet, as difficult as backing off might be, the USA wasn't created to be the planet's policeman.  This sad situation is in Europe's backyard not ours.  They should be the ones who deal with it.","Specifically what does Putin want and most importantly what does he fear.  What's underlying his often childishly clever (Russian troops on vacation) but transparent (elephant in the living room) pushing-the-limits behavior. As a mental health counselor, I learned early on that uncovering and identifying core reasons underlying overt behavior provided a clearer more complete understanding of a presenting problem so it could be more astutely addressed and dealt with.  Because all humans, including Putin, have a psychological foundation, it would be wise if Behaviorists were involved in all mediation including Putin and Ukraine.","Trying to punishcontrol Russia's excursians into a soverign country, like Ukraine, through sanctions on banks and businesses utilized by Putin and friends, is an exercise in futility when seen from the vantage point of the complex crafty co dependent monied shell game being played, revealed in this eye opening piece.","Watching the gut wrenching but outstanding documentary the Rise and Fall or the Third Reich on the History channel and observing actions similar to Putin's in Ukraine brought chills up my spine...And compatible with that freightening observation, someone wrote elsewhere, Putin is no Hitler, but Hitler would recognize his moves. ..For example, like Hitler, Putin knows that deception, misdirection, surprise and big lies are among his most effective tools; he knows to turn an ethnic Russia minority into a kind of Trojan horse waving favorable flags; he knows to use controlled state propaganda to make it look like Russia is there for protection, then rant and rave and demand redress when there is an angry counter response, followed by raising the temperature claiming attack to justify the next invasive move.  (it worked for Hitler).  And it's the card that was played in Crimeia--and perhaps will be the card played in other parts of the ex Soviet space and on and on. ..If Putin believes that Russia has a messianic role in world history, similar to Hitler, and is thus driven to restore Russia's historic unity, a trance-like drive like that is extremely hard to stop making sanctions seen like a drop in the bucket...Thus, in addition to sanctions, and to avoid being caught flatfooted like during Crimeia, the west should peruse Hitler's Guide for Aspiring Hegemons which some indicate provides guidelines Putin is using now and also used in Gerogia in 2008."
William,,,,Western officials should feel at fault for the continued violence by appeasing Putin and Russia hegemony.,"I think Putin has been a more effective leader than Obama when it comes to fighting the terrorists in Syria.  Obama hasn't closed any of the Islamic State's numerous Facebook pages. websites, bank accounts and twitter accounts.  So why has Obama left a known terrorist group like ISIS with the ability to continue their recruiting in the USA and Europe?  The NSA must have known about the thousands of recruits out of the UK and Europe going to Turkey so why weren't they stopped?  ISIS has been selling oil since 2012, but who are they selling the oil to?  Turkey?  Obama's pentagon knew the exact location of 60 ISIS terrorist training camps, but why didn't they destroy them?  I could go and on about all the lies concerning Obama's half hearted war on terror, but it all boils down to the fact that ISIS has been wilfully allowed to grow for the purpose of removing King Assad.  Obama's gambit of using the bad guys to accomplish the mission has blown up in his face, and he now has the equivalent moral authority of an earthworm.  China and Iran have joined Russia in Syria so any move by Obama could very well start World War III.  As far as the war on terror, I wouldn't say that Putin is winning, but I think he has been a way more effective leader than Obama.","The lasted four paragraphs of this story should have been the lead of the analysis, as Mr. Putin's state of mind is the central, over-arching concern.","I suggest all Ukrainians learn to speak Russian.  They will need it because Putin is not going to back down.  Why would he?  We are too weak to stop him, and the Europeans are only wringing their hands, hoping the Fairy God Mother will save the day.  The only mother in play here is Mother Russia.","Outrage from US elected officials is a sham.  Russia's oligarchs and ours are pals.  They kick back at Swiss ski resorts together, golf in the Abu Dhabi, and compare investment strategies.  Fulminating against Putin by Obama, Kerry, Graham et al, works nicely on the 'little people,' ginning up their false and dangerous notions of patriotism.  Putin's little war is a godsend to the USA.  It makes the case for more bloated, insane military spending, especially in the USA, comprehensible to the nightly news crowd.  But even better, it validates the school yard excuse, 'he did, so I did it,'  with the public as the US eyes the planet for their own next 'little war.'  It would be an excellent plan to freeze the oligarch's assets, as the author correctly points out.  A better plan would be to freeze the oligarch's, and this by arresting them.",,,,,
Excellency,,,,"Back in the nineties when Nafta was being debated and Ross Perot was entertaining us with his presidential run, I suggested USA and Russia join the EU. I could not find a single person in USA and WestEuro  who agreed with me which I found odd...In any case, my only comment on McFaul's piece today is that Putin was created by the Kosovo campaign when we were bombing a European capital for the first time since WWII. Basically Yeltsin, who called Bill Clinton my freind, was finished and the stage was set for the return of the Russian Tsar and his secret police. ..Moreover, the Kosovo paradigm is now being used to justify the intervention by Russia in defence of minority Russian populations in other sovereign states. It hardly matters what arguments are offered by our UN Ambassador and Sec of State to distinguish the Kosovo situation as a legal matter. The only thing that matters is what the Russian people believe because that is what empowers Putin.","What I find ironic about much of the editorializing from media and politicos is that it seems to condemn Russia while helping it forward on the path that is being condemned,..For example, Friedman's arguments could be used by hawks in Russia to urge on Putin a fast track to reconstitution of historic Russia...And how about the Obama Russia policy? Russia is never so weak historically as when it absorbs western ways and never so strong as when it retracts into a xenophobic shell. Isolating Russia is the last thing I would recommend. There is ample proof for my argument and it would not hurt Obama to pick up some Russian culture. The general weakness of Yeltsin's Russia and the contrast with Putin follows a recurring theme.","The didactic comparison I would make is Putin to Nixon...Putin needs to liberalize Russian society otherwise he will not succeed. Unfortunately, he must have his hardhats and persecuting pussy riot is his way of polarizing the demographics in his favor. ..His annexation of Crimea is understandable in terms of security. There just is no other alternative military base. I betcha most people think Ukraine would be a more reliable security partner for the USA than Russia. Think again. Who do you think helped GeoBush more on his war on terror, NATO member Turkey or Russia? Russia, clearly. ..Again, it was Nixon's hatred towards liberal society that brought him down, in a difficult historic period for the USA.",,,,,,,
Judy R,,,,"What thee NYT editors failed to mention is that Putin's stance against the West actually enhances him in the eyes of the majority of the Russian people ant that is one thing that keeps him in power.  Western economic sanctions against Russia and NATO's increased military presence in Eastern Europe are perceived by most Russians as threats against their prosperity and security.  Predictably, they feel the need for a strongman of their own to stand up against what they see as Western aggression.  Putin is perfectly happy to exploit the roll of foil to the West, which gives him the added bonus of a convenient way of distracting his people from the real source of the economic problems Russia faces -- the decline in oil prices. The continued crisis in Ukraine is actually helping to keep him in power.","The US couldn't pick a better way to  bolster Putin's popularity with the Russian people.  The threat of Western aggression is the best card he holds in legitimizing his autocratic regime and now we have given him the perfect justification for playing it.  Doubtless, this ill-advised move of threatening Russia militarily will only serve to strengthen his hold on power.","It would be interesting to read a similar piece on how much the fallout from the Ukraine situation has hurt the economies of the EU nations, many of which are  dependent on Russian gas and oil.  Their political leaders are far more likely than Putin to lose their jobs if their countries' slowly recovering economies take yet another nosedive.

Joe,,,,A broad national dialogue.  Sounds like Putin has learned his lessons well from the demagogues in the U.S.,"Meanwhile, while I was routinely derided for suggesting Putin's moves in the Ukraine and elsewhere are about communism, a May Day parade was held in Red Square for the first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union.

He uses Obama's demagoguery like easing tensions against him.

He has a lot of competition for that title on this side of the pond.,"Putin looks quite rational compared to Obama.  The U.S. has succeeded in training just a handful of moderate rebels, despite spending tens of millions of dollars.  If anyone is going to beat ISIS in Syria it's going to be Assad and his Russian backed army.  Unless of course, the U.S. wants to put boots on the ground.",A good pool hustler knows to take a loss now and then to advance the end goal.  I wonder what Putin is planning?
skeptonomist,,,,"The nation of Ukraine was a poor conception from the beginning. Its borders were based on the administrative convenience of the Russian Empire and the USSR, not real demography.  It was never stable, and kleptocrats and extremists dominated.  The West supported its creation when the USSR broke up primarily because it represented a large loss of territory for Russia.  Rather than address the legitimate claims of Russia and the Russian inhabitants of Ukraine, the US has constantly pressed to bring Ukraine into its economic and military orbit.  It supported the violent overthrow of the elected government.  All this has the effect of strengthening Putin's hand in Russia - Russians have a much more immediate interest in the matter than the US...Rather than address the problems realistically, Cohen - and the Times editorial board - take a sterotypical nationalistic, cold-war attitude.  Everything is blamed on Putin and he is demonized as any opponent of US policy always is.  It's no wonder we have things like the Iraq invasion when the media operate like this.","It is Cohen and others like him who are resurrecting the Cold War.  Where exactly has Russia taken action except in former Republics where there has been an actual Russian majority?  Probably there is cynical political opportunism in this, but at least Putin didn't make up phony WMD's to invade countries to which Russia had no claim whatsoever. In view of the US imperialism in the middle east and the expansion of NATO it is hardly surprising that Russians - not limited to Putin - should be wary of the US and its European allies.","Putin is trying to have it both ways in the Middle East, but this is not something he invented. The US wants to have it both ways, supporting Saudi Arabia which in turn supports Sunni dictatorships and revolutionaries in many places.  Then the US supports the Shiite regime in Iraq, which has ties with Iran, which the US opposes.  Maybe Putin's problem is that he is only trying to do it two ways, while the US pursues multiple conflicting objectives.","So is interference in civil conflicts now against the rules?  Anyway I guess the rules were different when the US armed the mujahedeen insurgents in Afghanistan, or (much) more recently took sides against the government in Libya, or in many more examples over the years.  Or are the Times editors just being hypocritical in the standard nationalistic way?  Or is it the rule that when the US mixes in it is freedom fighting, but when Putin does it is is aggression?","Friedman is even more obtuse than usual in this column, probably deliberately so.  There is a serious split among the people who live within the borders of the state now called Ukraine - omitting the Crimea, the majority, of Ukrainian ethnicity and language, favors closer ties with the West.  But the Russian-speakers, which actually form a majority in some of the eastern provinces, would rather be allied with or part of Russia.  ..This is not a result of Putin's dreams of restoring the Russian Empire, it is the result of a) an ill-considered formation of national boundaries on the administrative divisions of the former Empire and USSR; and b) the push by the US and Western European nations to extend their economic and military (NATO) influence and a natural resistance of this by Russia.  The nation of Ukraine was unstable from the beginning and susceptible to outside influences.","Friedman is even more obtuse than usual in this column, probably deliberately so.

The fact is that Russia, like the US, doesn't care about legality when its national interests are at stake. Invading Crimea is no more illegal than invading Iraq, or the many countries  in the Western Hemisphere that the US has invaded or occupied over the years.  Does the US have a greater right to invade say Panama than Russia to invade Crimea? The US will certainly continue to do this when it feels the necessity and probably Russia will too.  ..The US and Western Europe (to a lesser extent) will try to sanction Russia as far as possible, but this is hardly a matter of legality or morality, it is just international power maneuvering. Maybe the next time it is a question of the US invading some country to protect its interests - or for no good reason at all - the Times will be concerned about legality, but I doubt it.","Putin and his jingoistic supporters in the Kremlin would like to incorporate eastern Ukrain into Russia, and the jingoists in the West, including the NY Times editors, want the area to remain under the control of the western-favoring Ukrainians.  If there is a conflict, let's hope it doesn't escalate into WW I.  Too bad borders weren't settled in a reasonable way when the USSR broke up, but Russia was in a position of weakness then and didn't press its claims...Is this a situation like that when Hitler demanded that the Germans in the Sudetenland have self-determination?  If Putin had spelled out his ambitions of world conquest in his autobiography there would certainly be grounds for thinking so.  But these decisions are not easy, except in hindsight.  Should the big powers back up their allies in the little countries to the hilt and possibly cause another WW I? Or should a megalomaniac be allowed to extend his reach, leading eventually to another WW II?  I see no sign that the NY Times editors have the wisdom to make these kinds of decisions.",,
Richard Luettgen,,,,"The last line of this editorial confirms its invalid premise, which is that Vladimir Putin can be made to reason in a manner that the West regards as rational. That last line was That is neither in Russias interest, nor the Wests (referring to the prospect of a NATO more insistently parked on Russias doorstep)...Interests are a funny thing: theyre often not rational from the perspective of any but those who own them. If Russias interests include reclaiming the extinct Soviet Unions borders, then a confrontation with the West probably figures largely in plans to secure them. Oil is a famously cyclical business that at present is depressed but could rise out of that depression again; and, if it does, an economy as dependent on it as Russias could rise again and use it as the cudgel with an oil-and-gas-needy Europe it was prepared to before the petro-crash. So long as this prospect holds out hope for Putin, why would he change his approach as long as he retained his current view of interests, and as long as he could at least weather sanctions?..The key is to build incentives for Vladimir Putin to change his view of those interests.","What should emerge from the U.N. opening and its endless speeches is that the U.S. and the West it putatively leads has lost all semblance of real leadership in the Middle East to a Russia headed by Vladimir Putin, and his allies of convenience for the moment, Iran, Syria and the Shiastan portion of Iraq...Mr. Obama can rail against the destabilizing forces of the region, largely ISIS, but clearly has little interest or intention of doing anything about them OTHER than complain. That leaves the only interested approach to be Russia's; and Russia's interests will remain in keeping Bashar al Assad's Syria viable so long as Assad kills Islamist jihadists in Syria, allowing Putin to avoid that chore in Russian enclaves...To what miserable levels have we sunk.","The only winner in this exchange is Putin. He defends the status quo, which now appears to be perpetual and benefits him by having Assad kill Islamist jihadists in Syria rather than forcing Putin to kill them in Russian enclaves. President Obama knows not WHAT to defend, except that he doesn't like the status quo, while not being willing to expend the effort and other resources to change it...All Putin needs to do is breathe in and breathe out to get what he wants. Barack Obama needs to dramatically change how he approaches the entire Greater Middle East to bring about beneficial change. Guess who wins?..Complaining about realities on the ground while ignoring mistakes made for years gets us nowhere.","In order to be defeated you need first to contend with an adversary who bests you by whatever means. We never even seriously contended, so Im not sure we can call this a proper defeat for the West...Europe knows this rationalization well, since despite a combined population quite comfortably greater than that of the U.S. and a standard of living for its wealthier nations at least equal to ours, and some would argue superior to ours  it hasnt been able to project material force for decades as it incrementally stripped its defenses in order to feed its gargantuan and rapacious social welfare systems...Russians dont eat as well as Germans, on average, but it they clearly now have the Crimea, and appear to have a healthy chunk of Eastern Ukraine. The Euro-buffer states eye the east VERY nervously and even Western Europe is wondering how many Russian language teachers might be available on short notice...It may not have been a defeat for the West in Ukraine rather than a Putin win by forfeiture; but disengagement has its prices, and its not merely pride that is sacrificed. The shades of the dead in Ukraine can attest to that...The sad truth is that while Mr. Obamas real motivation for turning the other cheek is a better ability to Europeanize our OWN social welfare framework, it actually looks to much of the world as if hes afraid of Vlad the Impaler. Imagine that in a U.S. president.","Thank heavens for Roger. I cant begin to express how tired I am of commenting on the U.S. Supreme Court decision on ObamaCare...For much of the 20th century Russia was a thuggish, fascistic state whose objective was to get the rest of the world to fund their dysfunction and strategic non-viability  even at the point of a nuclear gun. They usually failed. Not for nothing are Russians famous for their moroseness...Im astonished by how Roger romanticizes the motivations underpinning Russias and Putins escalating conflict with the West. It may be that their intellectuals, caught there like long-dead insects in amber, have a shrinkish need to justify that conflict by ennobling it with emblems of rectitude offered up by an Orthodox Catholic religion that until only recently was formally banned in Russia as in all parts of the former Soviet Union; but thorazine might be a better remedy...And Russia pivots to the East only because the West wont have her. If that changes as incentive, watch how quickly Putin re-pivots...Russia is not the Soviet Union (some there just think they are). The Wests real charge is mere regional containment as they focus most of their energies on the world that exists outside an amber prison.","The natively Spanish-speaking have this expression: Palo si boga, y palo si no boga. Basically, it means that you get clobbered whatever you do...If neither troops nor lethal assistance is provided Ukraine in its fight with Vladimir Putin, he's going to win as Ukraine continues over-matched and is drained of the capacity to resist. That means an eastern Ukraine at least dominated by Russia and, despite the editors' doubts, possibly annexed by Russia; and, in either case, the rest of Ukraine is thoroughly dominated by Russia. Yet, providing soldiers raises the specter of western troops (overwhelmingly American, let's be honest) at war with Russian troops; and providing money or materiel, or both, risks a forever-war that allows Putin to continue to stoke-up Russian nationalism and deflect attention from his dreadful management of Russia's economy. Putin needs to be shown that the drain on his own resources that he needs for other purposes could become perpetual...There's no way Ukraine is important enough to the west to risk war with Russia, but we should remember that the U.S.S.R. eventually foundered largely because it couldn't compete economically with the west while maintaining a credible defense capacity -- they tried and failed. Painting a picture of perpetual western financial and arms assistance to Ukraine, buying the confederation idea but insisting that Ukraine join the Eurozone may have the legs necessary -- and may be the only rational way out.","ISIS in Iraq and Boko Haram in Nigeria jointly constitute the ugliest geopolitical mugging happening in the world today, and not Mr. Putin's outrages...Ukraine's government may share our values, but it's not only fighting Russia's surrogates and soldiers, it's also fighting the plutocratic and corrupt remnants of the traditional Ukraine that it unseated electorally but not completely yet in fact. With BOTH adversaries to contend with, they very well may lose, regardless of any help they get from the west...If they do lose, to either or both forces, we should note that the world lived just fine for a very long time with a Ukraine that first was an integral part of the USSR, then was dominated by Russia; but the world hasn't seen for centuries the destructive Islamist force of ISIS and Boko Haram, and their potential for destabilizing entire regions...I also can see us sending soldiers to train Ukraine's armed forces, since we have soldiers to spare just now. But as to money, particularly the 15 billion, I see this as a Euro responsibility and not ours. It's perhaps about time that Europe get involved in shared defense responsibilities beyond a NATO that is overwhelmingly American, and ally status in our Middle Eastern involvements that were appreciated but relatively small in scope...And all the west needs to do to counter any oil shock effect of Putin's adventures is to declare that they're all-in for fracking shale-accessible reserves that seem to be increasing daily.","Mr. Putin's next move is to continue to press Europe, now that it's become very evident that the U.S. is generally retreating from its global military obligations. He senses blood, but blood that will only be flowing for 645 more days, so he'd better be quick about exploiting a fleeting advantage...We view his moves regarding nuclear swagger as dangerous, but are they really? We speak of miscalculations, but isn't it obvious that the U.S. will back down wherever it feels it has a choice? Such as in Syria, such as in Iran, such as several years ago in Iraq? And what evidence do we have that our pivot to Asia has resulted in anything other than draw-downs in troop strength elsewhere?..NATO technically may be able to call on over 3,300,000 troops of its member nations, but those numbers are dwindling, and are very heavily weighted to U.S. military anyway --  since 2010, European nations have cut their military forces by a total of about 160,000 troops, and members have announced continued cuts to better afford entitlement frameworks that are becoming unmanageable. As one example, Britain announced that it will cut another 30,000 armed forces personnel, leaving just 147,000 troops by 2020. We have our own plans to cut our military...So, Putin may be resorting to dangerous provocations to secure his aims, but he also could shrewdly recognize that the West has reordered its priorities, and defending itself against him has moved rather low on the list.","No cease-fire will stick until it becomes evident what the least is that Mr. Putin will settle for. If that's a forever-war that will keep the region perpetually destabilized, then Europe will need to decide what a Ukraine as member while on the frontiers to Russia really is worth to them. The cost will be high. It will be higher still if Putin wants Ukraine as a transparent satrapy of Russia; less if he'll settle for the eastern regions...But the inability to define what it is that Putin will settle for risks cycles of breakout and a lot of death that, in the end, won't contribute at all to the solution that will eventually be imposed...Regardless of what it is that he'll really settle for, it's in everyone's interests to know what it is soonest.","There was a time when Richelieu was considered by many to be a first-class jerk and thug; but he was respected because he did what he did for his country -- which he largely regarded to be his king and himself. Mr. Putin may well believe the same, on all counts  -- indeed, he may consider himself to BE both king and country...The pope, of course, IS a real king, and the living embodiment of a sovereign state, so maybe he has a march stolen on Mr. Putin. While he has a better claim to being a first-class jerk and thug, we can be thankful that he's not...But, frankly, I don't think expanding NATO meant a hill of beans to Russia in any but a purely symbolic sense. Today, NATO can field about 50,000 troops, of which about 33,000 are American. One can argue that in addition to NATO, the nations of the west have their own militaries; but one has to wonder what they're good for, other than protecting Russian gas pipelines into their countries. Certainly, NATO puts on a proud face but, if push comes to shove, what can it really do?..That Pope Francis says what he says despite knowing that he's opposed by the red-hats says a lot about the kind of man he is. That we seek to protect western Africa from Ebola and Mideast apostates from ISIS, while Vladimir Putin supports Assad in killing Islamist jihadists in Syria to avoid needing to kill them in the Russian Federation ... says a lot about who we are and who Mr. Putin is."
trblmkr,,,,"Putin's goal is to become China. In terms of economic heft and its attendant power. He has ben schooling off of China since before he first took office. He saw how all, really all, Western FDI was going to China while Russia tried 'democracy' under Yeltsin with 120 splintered parties in the Duma..Now, he watches as all of the US's 'allies', except Japan, scrambled over each other to become 'founding members' of China's IMF lookalike, the AIIB, so they don't miss out on all those juicy infrastructure projects..Old school G-7 style free market democratic alliances didn't die, they committed suicide at the altar of globalization!.Putin is playing a cynic's game and he is probably right to do so, sadly.","Not sure what Mr. Cohen is protesting here. Of course the reaction to Putin's thuggery should be led by Germany and Merkel. The EU's bilateral trade with Russia is many many times the US's..As to force and arming the Ukrainians, that sounds like an open ended venture with little chance of success and a very high chance of deadly escalation. I'd say the current US approach is Goldilockian.","Really, do I have to? Would you really prefer to have Putin as your leader??","I don't understand. Burnish his image?  He's not running for anything anymore. Fine, let Putin step into the quagmire.","If this crime isn't enough to spur the EU (are you listening Chancellor Merkel?) to join the US in really putting the economic squeeze on Putin's Russia, nothing will. And then he's won.","There is a language Moscow understands: antitank missiles, battlefield radars, reconnaissance drones. Bolster the Ukrainian Army with them and other arms. Change Putins cost-benefit analysis...I still disagree. I think there is still much more that can be done with more sanctions and isolating Russia economically. We have got to find a way to provide Europe with energy so they can tell Putin what to do with his oil and gas.","European nations, for their part, would prefer not to impose wide-ranging economic sanctions, which could hurt trade with Moscow...Yes, God forbid anything ever interfere with trade. Trade with Europe is the only thing keeping Putin so well-behaved. Wait a minute.....The chairmen of Siemens, Thyssen Krupp, Adidas, etc. who have been appearing on German TV and even going to meet Putin to kiss his...ring, should be thrown in jail!","It's unassailable that Putin is a thug but let's remember that after 1989 when Russia was trying to make go of representative democracy (there were over 100 parties in the Duma, debate was lively) and China was crushing dissent, the West threw its money at China and totally ignored Russia. We talk democracy but invest in stability..Putin saw this and then just followed his natural tendencies..As a side note, does anyone know if He and Merkel crossed paths in the former East Germany?","This is further evidence of the crystallization of the world into blocs of rule of law countries led by the USA and rule of man countries led by a joint venture (for now) of XiPutin. Putin is showing the rest of the rule of man bloc that he will back their despotic regimes..Meanwhile, corporate entities in our bloc (Rule of Law) are undercutting us by doing business with the other bloc no matter how they behave. Case in point, German corporations had to dragged kicking and screaming into the post-Crimea sanctions regime and are only now participating most grudgingly.","I'm disheartened by the  lack of pro-sanctions commentary here and the dominance of Putin lackey propagandists. Merkel's right, sanctions should be maintained if not strengthened until Russia's meddling ceases. To all those sputtering on about a US led coup I say prove it..If ethnic Russians really want independence they should go about it civilly, not take up arms. I don't recall separatism in Ukraine's southeast even being a thing until Putin created it."
Jon,,,,"Dear Mr. MacFarquhar,..I realize you don't know this (how could you know this?)...But Russia, which most U.S. Republicans deeply admire, is a one-party dictatorship...So Russia approves whatever Vlad Putin decides to do. Just like the Politburo did for the Kremlin leader in the former Soviet Union...Hope this clears things up for you.","So NATO, having picked off the Baltic states and ex-ASSRs one by one and absorbed them into NATO in a way that it had promised it wouldn't, and having provoked Russia continually with episodes like the silliness in Georgia, continues to beat the war-drum that its' arms corporations do so well out of....And sending heavy weaponry into Eastern Europe is 'necessary' for 'defence', is it? At this rate the Azov battalion in Ukraine will be the most heavily armed, well-supplied and financed bunch of nazis since the Waffen SS....An oppressive autocrat like Putin requires a bunch of useful fools like the NeoCons pushing for war in Europe, in just the same way that Osama bin Laden couldn't have achieved a fraction of what he set out to do without the dual klepto-idiocy of Bush and Cheney. So starting a war in CentralEastern Europe just to provide NATO with a continuing raison d'etre is dumb even by NeoCon standards - except that they will be sitting on the sidelines making money from arms, supplies etc, just like the Cheney family did in Iraq, and they won't be doing any of the dying and suffering...Putin got it half right when he said: I think some countries are simply taking advantage of peoples fears with regard to Russia. What he should have said is some plutocrats, arms companies and banks, rather than countries.","Dear Mr. MacFarquhar,..I realize you don't know this (how could you know this?)...But Russia, which most U.S. Republicans deeply admire, is a one-party dictatorship...So Russia approves whatever Vlad Putin decides to do.

That sells at home and wins allies abroad...But he knows full well the lessons of Afghanistan and the limits of power, even as he pressed us against the limits...Obama, on the other hand, has NO power. Regardless of what Obama does or does not do, HIS Congress will criticize him because they see Obama, not Putin, as their worst enemy...And although the U.S. belongs to NATO, NATO is more and more an expensive toy gun, shared with a bunch of European allies who have no stomach to end the 70 years of relative peace and prosperity that began in 1945. Even most Europeans, as they beat us on Greece, can't see that in NATO, Greece is THE key member state at this time...And we have no credible Muslim allies, i.e., no allies that are in any any better than Putin's allies...except Putin's allies are more reliable.","Advantage Putin...1) Putin is a dictator who controls his country's government. Obama, the democratically-elected leader of the country that calls itself the leader of the free world, is even more hated by his own U.S. Congress than Putin is hated by that same U.S. Congress, many of whose members compare Obama to Stalin...2) Putin's allies (e.g., Syria and Iran) are just are bad as most of our allies (e.g., Egypt, Iraq and Turkey). But Putin can actually count on his allies. The U.S. has NO allies on which we can count...3) Because of 1) and 2), Putin actually has a plan, while the U.S., Europe and our Middle Eastern allies still have no plan. At all.","If Russia had really wanted peace, it could have exerted pressure on Assad before the civil war...Another laughable EDITORIAL by the NY Times that I won't read. No, Putin's meddling once help many people, any more than Bush's meddling in Iraq, or LBJ's meddling in Vietnam, helped many people.

(And certainly Putin et all are no better!)","I love it when the title of an article tells me that the article is NOT worth reading...Is Putin Winning?..Yes, in the minds of most Americans like Mr. Douthat, someone is always winning or losing because life is a metaphor for sports (not the other way around)...The 21st century WILL belongs to the BRICs: Brazil, Russia, India and China.

Seldoc,,,,"Many of the same people who cheered when President Reagan invaded Grenada to protect a handful of American citizens are now condemning Putin using the same logic to justify his actions in Crimea.  Moreover, Russia actually does have real strategic interest in Crimea.  The same can't be said of the United States vis a vis Grenada.","The idea that Romney could or would have done anything differently is absurd.  What precipitated Russian actions was the revolution in Ukraine, the chaos that resulted and the installation of an unfriendly regime.  They saw what they perceived to be a threat on their border, and they acted and are acting in accordance with that.  They are not doing anything different than what the United States would do and has done numerous times in the past...What's even more absurd is the idea that President Obama conspired with President Putin to go easy before the election.  How these conspiracy theories originate, take root and then flourish is truly a mystery.","Although today's Russia is not the same as the USSR, a lesson can be drawn from the fact that the USSR suffered approximately 25,000,000 deaths during WWII and didn't surrender.  Given that, the idea that they'll fold on account of these or any other sanctions is probably wishful thinking.  Instead the impositions of sanctions will probably only serve to harden their wills especially given Putin's popularity.",,,,,,,

Crimea, as a warm water port, is a vital economic and security asset to Russia and has been for centuries. The West made an attempt to wrest it from Russian access, and Russia protected its interests because it it saw itself as having no other choice. Crimea cannot exist without logistical support from the Ukrainian mainland and Russia saw itself as having no alternative but to retain access to the surrounding area. Being deprived of that seaport is a beatdown that not only Putin, but Russia as a whole, will not take as long as they can climb up off of the mat..Insulting Putin is amusing, and he certainly does deserve it.

Of course Putin can ramp up his attacks but Obama will be doing the same.,"Reached out is a diplomatic way to put it.

But is oil-rich an oxymoron during a time of a world glut of oil and intensifying searches for new sources. Putin is trying to promote a war between Baku and Armenia to invite intervention. Frustrating Putin's moves is the fact that the world moved away from a barter economy several hundred years ago.

petitdane,,,,"More than 50 of the US voters would remove EVERY senator in US government, if they had the choice. I really figure that Putin is way more popular in his own country, than any president in USA has been for the last 20 years...Maybe thats a fact that influences the US action globally, nowadays. Just look at the US economy. Total debt 4x BNP.

Allowing this hurts both Russia and Ukraine."
Eugene Gorrin,,,,"Throughout the crisis, Russia and Putin have said one thing and done another. Even as the diplomacy takes its course, the West must sustain its pressure on Russia and its support for Ukraine...The starting point is to gauge whether Putin means what he says.  He has promised Russian troop withdrawals before only to fall short.  This time the retreat will need to be unambiguous.   The most revealing test of his sincerity will be Russias media, which have been doing their bit for the Kremlin by pouring out anti-Ukrainian propaganda. They must now cease their relentless warmongering...Suppose that Russia passes these tests, what then?  Until now, Putin seemed bent on fomenting confrontation in Ukrainewith the threat of Russian invasion kept in reserve.  He has 2 reasons to step back.   One is the increasingly burdensome sanctions that are beginning to damage the Russian economy. Second, and possibly even more troubling for him, is the increasing death toll in eastern Ukraine.  Russia risks being sucked in to the conflict to honor the guarantees of protection that it has given its supporters.  Although the threat of invasion is useful for him, actual occupation would involve huge costs. The sight of Russian and Ukrainian troops slaughtering each other would puncture Putins popularity at home. Much better to keep Ukraine smouldering than to have it burst into flame.","First, Vladimir Putin mauled Georgia, but the world forgave himbecause Russia was too important to be cut adrift.  Then he gobbled up Crimea, but the world accepted itbecause Crimea should have been Russian all along.  Now he has infiltrated eastern Ukraine, but the world is hesitatingbecause infiltration is not quite invasion.  But if the West does not face up to Putin now, it may find him at its door...Putin has used the Ukrainian crisis to establish some dangerous precedents. He has claimed a duty to intervene to protect Russian-speakers wherever they are. He has staged a referendum and annexation, in defiance of Ukrainian law. And he has abrogated a commitment to respect Ukraines borders, which Russia signed in 1994 when Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons. Throughout, Putin has shown that truth and the law are whatever happens to suit him at the time...The West needs to show Putin that further action will be costly. So far, its rhetoric has marched far ahead of its willingness to act.  Not enough is at stake in Ukraine to risk war with. And European voters will not put up with gas shortages, so an embargo is not plausible.  But the West has other cards to play.   ..One card is strategic  NATO should announce that it will hold exercises in central and eastern Europe, strengthen air and cyber defenses there and  send some troops, missiles and aircraft to the Baltics and Poland. NATO members should pledge to increase military spending...The other card is heavy sanctions.","European leaders have little remaining trust in Russian President Putin.  He has convinced them that he is a man of actionand an unpredictable one at thatbut not a man who keeps his word. ..As British PH David Cameron noted, What matters most is actions on the ground and not words on a piece of paper...The agreement is in parts vague and conditional.  It lacks strong monitoring and is likely to be subject to disputes on the ground. ..We'll see if it holds.  I doubt it because I simply don't trust Putin to keep his word.","Putin signed the decree that released his biggest political rival after 3,709 days of imprisonment:..Guided by principles of humanism, I decree to pardon convicted Khodorkovsky, Mikhail Borisovich, born in 1963 in Moscow setting him free of further confinement, Putin said in the decree published on the Kremlin's official website...Humanism?  Putin is such a progressive leader (note sarcasm).","Putin reminded the world that eastern Ukraine was once part of Russia, and warning that his parliament had given him the right to intervene militarily if confrontation escalates...In a four-hour, meticulously staged Q &amp; A session, Putin denied that Russian forces are on the ground in the towns and cities of eastern Ukraine, parts of which have been taken over in recent days by armed men, but pointedly did not rule out sending in troops in future...Accusing the Ukrainian authorities of pulling the country into an abyss, he called on Ukraine to pull back its heavy artillery from the east of the country, asking: Who are you going to use it against? Have you completely lost your marbles?..The Federation Council granted the president the right to use military force in Ukraine, he said, referring to the upper house of parliament. I really hope that I do not have to exercise this right and that we are able to solve all today's pressing issues via political and diplomatic means, Putin said...Putin referred to the region in question by its tsarist name Novorossiya, or New Russia, as it was referred to in the 19th century under tsarist rule, and suggested it was a historical mistake to hand it over to Ukraine...I'm surprised Putin didn't hold the Q &amp; A shirtless while mounted on a horse.  ..This guy is an egomaniac and control freak.","Many in the RepublicanTea Party are arguing that Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened in Crimea because of President Obama's weakness.  Putin saw that Obama didn't want to go to war in Syria, for example, and this emboldened Putin...It's tough to know what would have happened in an alternative universe. Imagine that Putin was in charge of Russia, but faced a different president, one who was tough, aggressive, who had no compunctions about invading countries...Oh wait, that happened in 2008.  Putin faced President George W. Bush,  who had invaded Afghanistan, as well as Iraq for good measure (and, in the latter case, defying massive international pressure and opposition).  And yet, Putin invaded Georgia.  And not, as he did now, in a stealthy way with soldiers who were already there who simply switched their uniforms.  He sent Russian tanks storming into Georgia and  without any referendums  simply annexed 2 pieces of that country...Does this prove that Bush was a wimp?   No. ..In 1991, the Soviet Union crumbled.  Russia gave up large parts of its  empire including Ukraine.  Since then, NATO, has expanded closer and closer to Russia's borders. And then, the West encouraged Ukrainians to take to the streets and depose their president, who had close ties to Moscow...Politicians in DC are convinced that Putin was encouraged by Western weakness. It's actually quite possible that Putin felt he was acting to stop the West's growing strength and his own weakness.","Vladimir Putin has blood on his hands...After days of resistance, pro-Russian rebels today finally yielded some ground surrounding downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17  handing over passengers bodies, relinquishing the planes black boxes and pledging broader access for investigators to the crash site...The developments offered some hope that an international investigation might clarify how the civilian jet was shot down Thursday in territory held by the separatists in eastern Ukraine. Experts warned, however, that the site had been compromised...The breakthroughs came after days of international outrage over scenes of bodies decaying in meadows under a hot sun...To repeat, Putin has blood on his hands - 298 passengers and crew.  ..This is not how civilized nations and individuals act.  He's not man enou8gh to take responsibility...When Russia seized Crimea a few months ago, I recommended that the US and nations comprising the EU recall their respective Ambassadors and senior diplomatic staff from Russia, and kick out the Russian Ambassador and senior Russian diplomatic staff to each of their respective nations.  ..I make the same recommendation again.","Looks like we're witnessing a marathon game of Risk...Betting that isolation from institutions and alliances will pressure Putin to change direction in Ukraine, representatives of the G-7 (the G-8 without Russia) announced they will hold their annual summit without Russia in June, and locate it in Brussels. The G-8 summit had been planned in Sochi until Russia decided to annex the Crimean peninsula in a move rejected by the US and its G-7 partners...I wonder if Putin will be forced to give back his G-8 softball shirts...The Obama administration believes Putin cares deeply about Russias status and respect among other nations, and may be dissuaded from advancing further into Ukraine or other nearby territory out of concern about escalating economic punishments, plus international scorn coupled with entreaties to join talks with Ukraines interim government...The Obama administration said Chinas unwillingness to support Russias takeover of Crimea through the UN Security Council, and the countrys relative neutrality on the Ukraine issue sent a pointed message to Putin that his bravado in marching into a tiny peninsula has not been widely admired, even by some of Russias most stalwart friends.","Russian forces have entered Ukraine and the military conflict is worsening after Russian-backed separatists swept into a key town in the east...A NATO military officer said well over 1,000 Russian troops are now operating inside Ukraine, supporting separatists and fighting with them...Russia says it has no involvement and denies sending in weapons or troops, despite the capture of 11 soldiers inside Ukraine this week who Moscow said had probably crossed the border by accident...For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the ability to deny Russia's involvement in the conflict has always been of utmost importance.   He has stressed that Russia is not a party to the fighting, and that all it wants from Ukraine is peace and a few trade concessions.  Deniability, however, is fast eroding. Despite increasingly surreal disavowals from Moscow, it is now apparent just how invested Putin is in the conflict's outcome.","Poor Putin.  He's having a really bad couple of weeks.  ..A game that Putin was winning so deftly in the spring has turned on him in summer: The Ukrainian military is bearing down on the pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine, and theres word that its on the verge of splitting the rebel-held territory in two and that two major rebel leaders have fled. Putin's supporting these guys because of a position he staked out months ago, even though theyve just gotten him into a whole mess of trouble by  shooting down a plane with close to 300 innocent civilians on board.  Which is why the EU has announced their toughest sanctions to date, slamming his finance, defense, and energy industries.   And, if that wasn't enough, the US  piled on Putin, too, sanctioning 3 major Russian banks...Theres very little Putin can do. He's trapped by a propaganda apparatus that has primed the Russian population to want blood and victory, so he can't really back off.  He's also spent his entire tenure creating Russia as a counterweight to the US and EU.   ..Sanctioning Putin is a gamble.  Not because it will adversely affect the US and EU, but because its hard to predict which way Putins going to go. One way to coax him along in the right direction is to discreetly offer him an out behind the scenes - e.g., pledging not to accept Ukraine into NATO, or making both Ukrainian and Russian the official languages of Ukrainebut something that Putin can claim as a victory, rather than submission."
Permyakov P.A.,,,,"Main difference between the Pope and Putin is a difference between potential and impotence in terms of direct influence. Pope is nice guy and his appeals are very proper. All in one, Francis (as well as every one a last raw of Popes) is indeed a moral compass. But that compass is being used for the purposes of decoration only. Enough to say: in last couple of decades Presidents of USA (who are themeself a very pious Cristians, thats for sure) started more wars of choice then any another set of national leaders. Of course Pope can say whatever he please - nobody in the West does pay any attention to his sayings. And thats a tragedy for sometime Pop does tell a clever things..In contrast Putin is far harder to be ignored and he do not hesitate to show his Western counterparts that they can be held accontable for the decisions they make and for the precedents they set. He keeps Westerners in check which can not be bad by difinition. So, Thomas, no matter how do You feel about Putin, he is a necessarily evil.","But you miss the main point: nobody likes Putin now!..therein we assume that nobody stands for nobody but Brazile, China, India etc. (50 titles in total); for additional information please refer to a list of abstainers on corresponding UN declaration","But you miss the main point: nobody likes Putin now!..therein we assume that nobody stands for nobody but Brazile, China, India etc. (50 titles in total); for additional information please refer to a list of abstainers on corresponding UN declaration","Err... dude, to grow more crops for biofuel you need to grow less crops for food.

George Xanich,,,,"Dialogue between Merkel and Putin is a promising sign; or is it a Russian ploy to divert the attention to Ukraine's aggression toward  ethnic Russians in east Ukraine. The fact the two are speaking maybe an indication that Putin is looking for a diplomatic out. But Merkel must take the reigns and discuss frankly what the issues are between Ukraine, Russia and the West.  She should make the elections of May 25 as the focus and assure Putin that they may be monitored by the UN and that the people of eastern Ukraine will be represented and served. Chancellor Merkel must be blunt and state to Putin that the elections will be held despite his meddling in eastern Ukraine. She must also emphasize that a united Ukraine free from Russian interference will be a benefit to Russia as opposed to a divided Ukraine which will present one international crisis after the other. Lastly, she must stress to Putin that Ukraine will not be offered nor will they ever be admitted into NATO and will have neutrality in global affairs. In exchange, Russia must acknowledge that Ukraine is Independent and that its territorial borders remain intact.","@ Mathias Weitz, thank you for your candidate response....! Allow me to answer with a question.  Why should the US contribute a disproportionate amount of monies and manpower for your defense in the form of NATO?  It is clear Merkel has a working relationship with Putin and I believe a free Ukraine would avoid future international crisis at Europe's backdoor. Germany is a respected economic power and it is time to assume the reigns and guide the EU through this European crisis!","What is to be learned from the current crisis in Ukraine....For some it is Russia cleaning house to impose peace and closer ties in the region toward Moscow... For others, it is a battle to reclaim a stolen identity from Russia and to achieve political, economic and cultural freedoms away from Russia...in essence to be Ukrainians.  As the battle rages on, a political solution seems to be the only solution and a bitter pill for Porosenko.  To pull the Ukrainian army out would cede more lands to Russian backed terrorists and spell defeat for Porosenko and Ukraine. The Ukrainian Army is dug in; attempting to hold on to what remains of its early victories against the eastern terrorists prior to Russias invasion.  The cease fire is on paper; Putin showed the world he had brokered a peace deal; but with the continuous fighting and with sophistry, he claims not to have control over his minions in eastern Ukraine.  If one side is willing to accept peace the other side sees opportunity to gain more through the guise of peace!","Good intentions on Putins part or has he lit the fuse of dissent in eastern Ukraine and now steps back to see how the elections will turn out and who will turn out, and if the results will be recognized in the eastern Ukraine.  Putin had no intention in invading eastern Ukraine; his subterfuge and sophistry of denying any involvement in eastern Ukraine has created a diversion from the real invasion that had occurred in Crimea. He has created chaos in eastern Ukraine and when threat of sanctions will pass he will again with stealth place Russian personnel in eastern Ukraine in the guise of protecting ethnic Russians.   The EU must have resolve and not become complacent in thinking Russia only wanted Crimea and must not believe he is showing good faith by pulling his troops back-- its not business as usual!","Observed Putin's speech on TV which played well to the Duma. However, Mr. Putin played revisionist historian with Ukrainian history. President Putin stated that Kiev is the crown jewel of the Russian Empire and that Ukraine and Russia are inseparable.  It is this rhetoric of denying Ukraine of its identity that is the crux of the problem; Crimea is gone and within a historical context, Russia claims are strong. But to Ukraine, their obstinacy over Crimea is a buffering effect against further Russian encroachments.  To protect Russians in Ukraine, Putin used the military .In areas of Donetsk and Kharkiv, where rioting is occurring, mostly by Russian provocateurs, Russian troops stand ready along the border.  Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have a substantial ethnic Russian population do they need to worry? The history of Russia has been a history of conquest; the history of Ukraine has been a history of survival and obtaining a world status of a truly independent nation free of Russian interference. Respecting a nations identity as an autonomous entity and acknowledging that both share a unique but different historical pasts, maybe the first step to end the current political crisis!","The Ukrainian crisis is one of many Russian transgressions upon Ukraine and its people. It is a history  of a people seeking autonomy and self identity; a history  clouded, manipulated and  supplanted with Russian propaganda.   Ukraine is at war and is in need of financial and military aid.  The US is at war with Isis, Al-Queda and the Taliban as Europe looks to the US to address the crisis in Ukraine.  The US and Ukraine have been keeping their side of the bargain.  A destabilized Ukraine will effect Europe both in the short and long term and embolden Putins imperialism ; Ukraine is Europes backyard and it is time for the EU to address the crisis.  Russia is in an economic downward spiral and further and more crippling sanctions should counter Putins military aggression. The US is not Europes 21 century Marshall plan. Europe must take the lead and confront Putin uniformly.  His plan in Ukraine is to make it an unattractive investment for the West. The West must counter with aggressive financing and investing in Ukraine and counter Putin with economic warfare; a war he cannot win.","It is clear that Putin is irrational; he cannot understand and comprehend higher abstractions of reason. To him force, the threat or the use of is a language he is fully immersed and familiar. To have diplomacy both must have certain parameters to discuss issues and problems and have an adroitness to pursue rational discussion. But if your counter part is of a late 19th, early 20th century rationale, diplomacy is pointless and caters to Putin's belief: the west is too weak and indecisive to meet and confront Russia militarily. As Minsk 2 takes hold, the EU and the US must have frank discussions on how to better prepare Ukraine for the next Russian incursion...In the beginning I believed diplomacy would prevail and Putin would back off. But economic sanctions and the corrosion of Russias economy only has solidified both Putin's and Russia's resolve. Perhaps, it is time to consider more drastic measures and speak a language that Putin understands!","Yes Russia, because of its xenophobia, is fearful of western encroachment. But focusing on Russia's phobia negates the fact that Ukraine was an historical entity predating Muscovite Rus. Hundreds of years of Russian invasion and subjugation of the Ukrainian people have lead to a revision of Ukraines history clouding historical facts with Russian historical fiction: i.e. Ukraine was is and will always be Russian. The current crisis is a war not with Russian backed terrorists but with Russia. Ukraines effort to look west is a natural proclivity to wrest its cultural, political and national identity away from their Russian oppressors. Putins involvement in Ukraine providing aide, military personnel and hardware to the eastern Russian terrorists has been rewarded, supported and acknowledged by the EU in the form of MinskII! The EU got its fragile peace without addressing the true issues between Russia and Ukraine; Putin got a weakened and fractured Ukraine by altering its borders; and Porosenko got the sympathy of the West but not the aide he needed.","Why does Russia fear a stabilized and economically viable Ukraine?  Why does it fear Ukraines close alignment with western societies?  Conversely, a destabilized, weak and chaotic Ukraine is exactly what Putin wishes as more instability creates more opportunity for intervention and annexation.  Yanukovych was the epitome of all that was wrong with Ukraine: weak, indecisive and its leader a political stooge of Putin.  For Russias entire rancor, the political upheaval in Kiev created opportunity for the long crafted plan of a NOVO-Russ which thrives and feeds upon chaos and turmoil   within independent nations where ethnic Russians reside.  Sophistry and perverted reinterpretations of western precepts of self-determination are Putin's duplicitous attempts in expanding his empire; his standing up to the west and promoting rabid nationalism within a Russian society is a diversion away from the free falling Russian economy.  What is to be learned from this lesson: Novo-Russ is Putin's foreign policy to create chaos, ferment insurrection and annex lands of neighboring nations illegally!!! This will remain the norm as the westerners speak the language of diplomacy and Putin speaks the language of brute force and Nationalism!","The following was revealed from the Minsk II agreement?  Merkel and Mulland never had a fair and impartial approach to negotiations; allowing Putin's terrorists 2 additional days to pound away at the beleaguered Ukrainian Army, securing more territory in the latest Russian land grab. To them they wish to have business as usual and lift Russian sanctions.  Deliberately excluding the Russian backed terrorists from the negotiations catered to Putins demands that eastern Ukraine should be federalized and recognized. Porosenko was victimized again; Crimea was stolen ; the eastern regions of Ukraine were incited to rebel against the Ukrainian government in Kiev and Russian staged pseudo referendums for independence; excluding a majority of people from voting. Now Ukraine is about to lose more land because of Russian AGGRESSION. But the one painful lesson that the west should learn and acknowledge; Ukraine stood against an overwhelming superior Russian Army; showing the world it is serious of its goal of Independence. The Ukrainian Army showed they are willing to fight for their land and freedom; perhaps serious consideration should be made for admittance into NATO or training and modernizing the Ukrainian Army to better withstand future Russian incursions. Unlike in the Middle East were nations directly affected by Isil refuse to commit boots on the ground; Ukraine does not ask for any American personnel, only a chance of countering the overwhelming odds against Russia."

Baltic countries went through this years ago and NATO is the only force that protects them now. Ukraine is now truly fighting for its Independence.","I can't believe the comments here. I'm not sure Putin is 100 wrong, This is not our war. Would you say the same in 1938? Would you rather wait until it IS your war?","Here's the question for you: where do you draw the line? The Crimean people voted decisively, yes. Never mind the Russian troops in control of the process, never mind that those counting the votes are pro-Russian, never mind that reporters were not allowed to be there. Who care if Crimea is in a different country?.This IS Putin asserting himself, testing how far he can go. Only fool would think he stops here.","Come on, Jennie C. In March, Mr Putin said the thought of annexing Crimea was complete nonsense. Several weeks later he was asked specifically about armed and masked soldiers on the streets in Crimea. Not about military presence! Soldiers, taking control of the buildings and airports. He said they were were local militia.  Yesterday he basically admitted that they were Russian soldiers.","Rodion,..I think you're forgetting something. Ukraine did not have enemies in the last 20 years. US was not its enemy. Russia was not its enemy. No Western country was its enemy. What Ukrainians want is to live in peace with their neighbors. They have given up their nuclear weapons in 1994 for God's sake! No Ukrainian soldier ever stepped on Russian soil. It's Russian Duma that has approved (unanimously) the request by Putin to use military on Ukrainian territory..Does that change Russia is not our enemy thinking? You tell me.","Vladimir,..Please don't talk about Putin's intentions like you know them. People much smarter than you and I have no idea what his intentions are. He said on March 4th he had no intention of occupying Crimea. Lastly, on NATO expansion. Are you really certain that NATO expansion was the cause of Russia's more aggressive foreign policies? And not the other way around? Nothing's black and white here.","Let me suggest that most of the readers never lived in Soviet Union, cannot read Russian and do not follow Russian media or politics. Soviet Union always needed an enemy and US was that enemy. When the Cold War ended and McDonalds and Starbucks  opened in Moscow the enemy image almost disappeared. Then everything changed with Putin in power. US is once again The Enemy of Russia. Kursk submarine sunk? Must be America's torpedo. Georgia had a new young US-educated President in 2008? US probably trained and sent him. Ukraine no longer wants corrupt government? Surely US is behind it, trying to put NATO soldiers next to Russia's borders. To most Americans this is very difficult to understand. We don't think that way. Here, even for John McCain Russia is somewhere near the bottom of the list of foreign policy concerns. In modern Russia US is The Devil himself. This is how Russian politics works now. This is why Russians cheer Crimea grab as enough of humiliation from the US. I just hope Crimea is the price for the world to see Putin's Russia for what it is.","EU failed, simple as that. UN failed as well. Both institutions showed how ineffective they are in the face of aggression. Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 did not teach world a lesson. Russia will not be satisfied while Putin is in power and Soviet mentality is alive. Expect more stories before the next elections in Russia in 2018.",,
Kojo Resse,,,,"I would like to be positive about this - but didn't Putin originally say - he was not invading Crimea ?  A few months after annexing Crimea didn't Putin say he had no intention of meddling in Eastern Ukraine ? Within a few months Russia in fact invaded Ukraine and took territory (in blatant violation of international law and frankly an act of war)   - after which wasn't the Minsk agreement was suppose  to insure a  permanent cease fire..  The Europeans at this point should not have their heads in the proverbial sand.. clearly this is not going to be the end ?  Putins domestic problems only make an expansion of this conflict enviable.  The master propagandist Putin needs a war to keep the Russian populations  attention directed somewhere else as their standard of living goes down the tubes ( Watch the movie Wag the Dog ). Unfortunately, I really think this is only a temporary measure - and Ukraine  needs to use this precious time to fortify itself against the inevitable as best they can  with or without Europes weak kneed help .  I believe Ukraine will need to be prepared to pay a much higher price than the already awful price they have paid so far for their freedom.",Amen to that .. the Putin resign needs to be squeezed ... to more re-set buttons until the dictator is out of power..,Lets hope your accommodating inclinations are correct .. sometimes it is hard to put the genie back in the bottle .. although with an economy the size of Italy - I doubt the Putin reign will last long when the west really gets serious.. waiting for Putin to butt up against NATO can also be a very serious gamble..,It appears the West and USA really now has the stark choice of isolating the Putin resign and turning Russia into a pariah state or simply ignoring the aggression ( which is the current path) - and hoping the Putinites are happy with gobbling up Ukraine - - and will go no further... (keep praying ?),,,,,,
simzap,,,,"The Syrian people don't want Assad. That's why there is a civil war there. But Assad can't be voted out or even forced out because he is under Putin's protection. Assad now holds less than half of his former country and its economy, infrastructure and people are being destroyed. Not because of US intervention. This has been going on before we started bombing ISIS. It's Russia that provided Assad with all his weapons and encouragement to kill his citizens not us.","Putin's meddling in the Ukraine has far outpaced anything any other country has done. Direct bribery and poisoning of Ukrainian politicians makes his charges against us laughable. Putin bringing back the Cold War and authoritarian government is destroying Russia and her neighbors chances for peace and prosperity, IMO.","Sovienyet, I would say our drones killed thousands of terrorist while the Putin's wars against the Muslim areas of the Russian Federation has killed hundreds of thousands indiscriminately. And, that is still ongoing to this day. Also, how about producing some evidence of our drones killing innocent people in Pakistan on purpose since you're so big on proof? Thousands of drone strikes and less than a handful of confirmed civilians that have been documented.","The territorial integrity of the Ukraine is being compromised by Russian military aggression and all the previously dominated countries that were once behind the Iron Curtain are threatened. If Putin crushes the will of the Ukrainians and re-installs his Quisling, Yanukovytch, what's to stop him from doing that to the Baltic states? In fact, fear of the action Putin is currently taking is why the previous Soviet satellites wanted to draw closer to the West and join NATO. In the end Russia would be better off without its military interventions IMO as would the U.S.",,,,,,
LMJr,,,,In sum: Todays oil price will be most affected by two men ....This is wrong.  Three men matter and Obama is the third.  Russia is on its heels because oil is down to 50 which was accomplished because the US has been changing the supplydemand ratio thanks to PRIVATE drilling in spite of Obama's resistance - like setting aside more ANWR.  He should do the reverse and drive oil down to 25 which would put an end to Putin and Iran to boot.,The sanction that would work best and permanently is for the US to drill from California to NY for crude oil and create a world wide glut..Drive down the price of crude to 50 and Putin and ISIS would be put of business.  They can only do what they can pay for and their economies are entirely dependent on oil prices..The Greens need to yield on this.  Solar will replace oil soon enough but the national security issue is today.,"Moore's Law has nothing to do with putting gasoline in our tanks and Putin will be dead before we stop using gas powered cars and trucks..In the meantime, producing all the oil and natural gas we can will put Russia in a recession and keep them there.  The writer somehow managed to turn a national security problem into a pitch for green energy.","Putin is able to do his thing because he can finance it.  He can finance it because he doesn't have to compete with Saudi Arabia to sell his oil and gas to Europe.  He doesn't have to compete with the Saudis because the US buys their oil..The answer, of course, is for the US to supply our own needs and even export.  This will drive down the price of oil and gas and the Russian people will throw him out.  It will take time but it WILL work.  Or we could start shooting..Our energy deficit has been called a national security issue.  Do we all know why now?.Obama should open all federal land to fracking and should approve all LNG export projects.  Today would be a good time to start and the markets will start to discount it right away.  The greens should even encourage this because natural gas is MUCH cleaner than coal.","The solution to Putin is simple and good for all.  The US has the power to create a glut of oil and natural gas that will bury Russia in recession.  That will stop him and his own people will throw him over..The greens need to support fracking too because natural gas is cleaner than coal.  In 5 or 10 years, renewables will catch up and the Russia's oil and gas reserves will be worthless.",Putin can only do what he can finance.  IT'S THE MONEY!.US energy policy has enabled Putin to tie Europe up because the Saudis are selling their oil here.  We should get serious and frack for oil and gas across the country and stop importing oil and start exporting LNG..Let Putin compete with the Saudis.  He will lose and his country will sink into recession.  His own people will throw him out..And this will be a permanent solution unlike all the lightweight ideas floating around now.,"Putin can do nothing without financing so there is only 1 solution to this problem - undermine the ability of Russia (and Iran) to finance themselves. It will take time to complete, but the energy markets will begin to discount the end right away. If I were Obama I would do the following..Open all Federal land to fracking for natural gas and oil - immediately..Approve all applications for LNG export terminals - immediately..And as a symbolic gesture, have Exxon load a fracking rig on the USS Ronald Reagan and ship it to the most promising shale gas site in Europe - immediately...When pundits called the US energy shortage a national security issue, this is what they meant. Environmentalists should also accept their responsibility for our energy shortage and get behind the use of natural gas as a substitute for coal, both here and in Europe. Environmental purity has kept us and Europe from being energy independent.  Which is worse - using a clean fuel like Nat Gas everywhere or struggling with Russia and Iran. Without the cash they get from exporting to Europe, Russia would not be able to finance their adventures and would be facing another revolt of their own people..To quote Khrushchev, we will bury you ------ with a flood of natural gas.","Putin can do nothing without financing so there is only 1 solution to this problem - undermine the ability of Russia (and Iran) to finance themselves.

Renewables will catch up soon enough, but fracking now will solve the problem sooner - maybe 30 years sooner?","Friedman offers a circuitous route to lowering OIL prices that would probably fail or at least take too long..A more direct approach would be to frack every square inch of shale from California to New York for OIL.  While we are at it, we could subsidize Exxon to do the same in Europe.  The crude market would see the writing on the wall and drive the oil price down promptly..Let Putin compete with the Saudis for whatever scraps are left."

But America is not ruled by murdering thugs who routinely murder opposition forces, steal private property, kill journalists at will, destroy freedom of speech, and elect criminals to its Duma. ..Russia is a dictatorship with nuclear weapons. Russia now is more dangerous than the defunct USSR since now it is lead by the greed of only one man, Putin. His cruelty is driven by personal power stemming from an extreme inferiority complex. ..Nova Rossiya is just a slogan that appeals to the masses who lovingly support Putin not unlike Hitler's fan club that marched happily to its own destruction.","Putin, Assad, are thugs and criminals not unlike George W. Bush and Cheney. They all should be on trial for murder. We all know that is a fantasy. It will never happen. At least Obama can call out Putin for what he is. I don't think he cares one bit. Sociopaths and psychopaths are blessed with this gift.","Putin's Russia is run by a mafia beholden to Putin, the godfather. Russia has no government but is a dictatorship run by Putin. Ukraine is worth fighting for. Ukrainians deserve our help. Unlike the Iraqis, the Ukrainian soldier will stand and fight for his country. With our help Ukraine can rid itself of the corruption that Putin so much loves. This little man with nuclear weapons is a danger to us all. Unfortunately, Putin's oil deals with EXXON, CHEVRON, BP, SHELL are more important to the US Congress than freedom for Ukraine or the security of the Baltic States and Poland.",Putin needed the approval of his Parliament? What a joke!,Putin is a thief and a murderer. That is all one has to know about Putin.,"Obama is just a gofer for the American oligarchs who do not want their Russian oilgas investments put at risk. If Putin took the Baltics tomorrow, Obama and NATO would do nothing and Putin knows it!  Wait til Putin demands that the USA return Alaska.",Putin needed the approval of his Parliament? What a joke!,Just remember that Putin's Russia is run by the KGBFSB. Murder of dissidents and annoying journalists is always an option. Confiscating billion dollar companies to enrich himself and his friends is part of Putin's democracy. Equating  US bumbling in foreign affairs with Putin's  will to conquer and occupy independent Eastern European Republics is absurd. It's like equating a pick-pocket with a murderer who breaks into your house and kills your family.,"Merkel, Hollande, Obama have already accepted the fact that NATO will not be able to stop Putin if Putin decides to make a quick dash to Riga, Latvia with his tanks. NATO's so called rapid reaction force will still be in its barracks putting on their underpants when the Red Army arrives in downtown Riga.  Without the Brits and Amis, there is no NATO army. Putin just doesn't care because he knows full well nobody is going to start WW3 over the Baltics, Poland and Ukraine. Obama has probably told him as much!","Putin will have Marienpol in his hands before or after the cease fire. The only thing Putin understands is brute force. Unfortunately the US is completely preoccupied with ISIS and Afghanistan thanks to George W., Cheney and Rumsfeld and their sycophants. If Jeb Bush gets elected we will be surely bombing Iran's nuclear enrichment sites."
Jim Michie,,,,"While the U.S. government and its military industrialsecurity complex, along with U.S. and Western corporate news media have done their very best to paint as ugly a picture as possible of President Putin and hype false reports of Russia poised to gobble up the rest of Ukraine, President Putin identifies all of this foolish and self-serving propaganda for what it really is with a direct phone call to Barack Obama.  Moreover, moving past all of this bravado and fear-mongering directed at Russia, let's not forget that it was the U.S. State Department and the Central Incompetence Agency (CIA) that funded the riots and coup in Ukraine to wishfully ensure Ukraine membership in NATO.  The whole informed world knows that Putin has his share of warts in foreign policy, but so does Obama!  After all, it was Obama and his disastrous foreign policy that instigated the turmoil in Ukraine and did serious damage to 15 years of rapprochement with Russia following the Cold War!",,,,,,,,,

I am no fan of Putin, but let's get real here: As with other administrations before it, the Obama administration thought it would be very clever and manipulate former Soviet bloc states with promises of loans, trade deals and new infrastructure. Of course, we weren't told about any of this. We were told that freedom was at stake, democracy was ready to spring forth, if only the State Department, IMF and the EU would be able to tilt their watering cans on this filter Ukrainian ground.

Kerry talks about a coalition which supposedly will call for Assad to step aside in the end even though Putin has already intervened on his behalf. When you have been reduced to the sidelines you don't get to call the end-game. The outcome is uncertain, but, should Putin's strategy work when we have done nothing, there's no reason for him to let us have a seat at the table.","Isn't Putin's air force there at the invitation of Assad? Obama continues to engage in regime change just like Bush only he doesn't do it so well because he lacks a strategy. He and Kerry talk about a coalition and an end-game which will somehow see Assad sidelined, but it's nothing but a backdoor attempt to take credit for any success Putin may have on his own. It won't work. Putin wins. We lose. Putin fails. We still lose.

The only truly-defeated entity at this early stage of a long story is the Ukrainian population itself, regardless of its individuals' mother tongue or regional residency. Mr. Cohen speaks of a truncated and dysfunctional Ukraine diverted from its Westernizing ambitions. But many cards remain to be played...Now, after the Russian-orchestrated military dismemberment, building a whole and healthy Ukraine out of today's ashes will be much harder, but sadly there wasn't much hope before. All the Ukrainian political forces, whether oriented West or East, have long been incorrigibly corrupt. Such is the legacy of many of eastern Europe's people's paradises...Examining this picture picture from a short-term zero-sum perspective, Putin has won. But what has he won for the citizens of the criminal state he has created? (Make no mistake about the core criminalily!) Pariah status on the world stage? A thug-driven economy in tatters? A damaged currency? A squndered global trust? A world community dtermined to avoid commerce with any .ru domain identity? Antagonized fear along the entire western  front?..If these are the spoils of victory, I'd hate to suffer the penury of defeat.","Willfully engaging the Syrian government in any fight against terrorism, as Vladimir Putin is claiming to do, is like fighting lung cancer by smoking it out with cigarette inhalation...<a hrefhttp:www.endthemadnessnow.org titlewww.endthemadnessnow.org targetblank>www.endthemadnessnow.org<a>","Mr. Putin declared I think some countries are simply taking advantage of peoples fears with regard to Russia.

Now it admits that it considered using nuclear weapons to cement its annexation. It threatens to nuke the Navy of a gravely threatening Denmark. It denies any involvement in the ongoing carnage in the Donbass. The loose lips of the post-Soviet regime bluster about nuclear warfare as though trash talking about BB guns and Bowie knives...War is utterly execrable, to be avoided at almost any cost. When that cost threatens to become an unstoppable history of totalitarian aggression, starting with a 21st-Century version of the Rhineland and Sudetenland, the cost must be paid.

A synonym for this is invasion...If he insists that he is confronting NATO and not a relatively small and defenseless Ukraine, perhaps NATO ought to flood some real military resources there in order to put up a fair fight...Hillary Clinton's World War II analogy was right on-target when she made it, as it continues to be now.

Do the math - longer term, this is where the shift of power is headed.","Yes, it is the Western media frenzy that whipped up all this. Putin has consistently said all he wants is good, close relations with Ukraine, and NOT having Ukraine join NATO, which would of course happen soon after EU. Anyone in US who says otherwise is a liar the same way that previous administrations lied about Eastward NATO expansion.","Can't have it both ways. The West has been constant in proclaiming the evil Putin is behind all of this. He has said he is not...choose a side. I do doubt that whatever he says, the East will just roll over.","The only reason China has been rather silent is they have their own internal issues like this. If anyone seriously thinks that either India or China would side with the US here, they need to do some studying. In the long run, Putin has already given up trying to work things out with the West, and this is what Russia is banking on - literally and figuratively- for the rest of this century at least.","One should well ask the same about NATO where Eastward expansion has been going on for over 20 years, breaking US promises. ALL Putin has said and asked for since the beginning is that Ukraine be left either as a continuing special trading partner with Russia, or at least NOT be taken into a separate, competing trade alliance, and not allowed into NATO. There is NO question that the West influenced (being kind) the government overthrow in Kiev. Now I understand Putin's crackdown on NGOs in Russia. ..The US has no moral authority to be the world's cop given our appalling lack of understanding about history and other cultures. I have zero sympathy for poor, innocent Ukrainians when they stand by while a SIZEABLE minority of their population is attacked by right-wing nut jobs, and treated like second-class citizens by their government. One need look no further than Mr. Tsarev, a member of Parliament from the East and candidate for President who has now been savagely beaten 3 times in the last month. ..Folks in the US...we already got into bed with Bin Laden way back defending against the evil USSR. Please be more thoughtful in looking at the situation in the Ukraine, where  there is also NO question that right-wing extremists are playing a major role in the government and armed forces","Rather disingenuous - yet telling of the ongoing Western media failure to exercise their role as getting to the FACTS -  to state despite the fact that Ukraine has not used antiaircraft weapons in the fight along its eastern border. The Russians have shown actual proof of the presence of exactly such weapons in this area, and Ukraine is trained in their operation. Also they used just such rockets in 2001 to down a civilian jetliner over the Black Sea - with nary an admission or apology when the truth came out. ..Further, there is ZERO CREDIBLE proof this was from a SAM - while it is NOT unreasonable the plane could have been shot out the air by a figher jet. And, who has fighter planes up and about all the time in this part of the country - the rebels - NO, Russia, NO - Ukraine. YES! ..So, before the usual US media ongoing leaping to conclusions takes us into a WMD-like frenzy leading into war, let's all DEMAND exactly what the Russians have been saying (and even the DUTCH!) - a true, independent investigation. The Russians had their own list of 10 questions - just as reasonable as the West's demands. Kiev is unwilling to release any ATC communications. To quote Obama, exactly what are THEY trying to hide?  At a minimum, there was some kind of course change by the plane bringing it even closer to the zone of combat...What does Putin or Russia have to gain here - NOTHING. What does Poroshenko have to gain by doing this and getting the world to blame Putin? EVERYTHING.","In fact, Russia gave Iraq fighters to fight ISIS, whom WE ARMED! Go figure. Putin was the one who warned Obama to be careful, that the freedom fighters were NOT waiting for democracy to flourish...","Uh, sorry, NO, they would not. That is where the simplistic evil Mr. Putin logic gets the West in a bind. These folks quite clearly have said butt out.....Beyond this, of course, the FACT that the Ukrainian regime chose to blow off the requirements that ALL parts of the country be returned to normalcy, and rejects that they have to disarm violent right-wing things because they have essentially drafted them into their National Guard (partyl because if they did not, their butts would be next up, and partly because...well, who is going to disarm these guys. The East will abide by the terms when the rest does, NOT when Mr. Putin tells them to...or, for that matter, any arrogant Western powers who are going along with continued UNdemocratic behavior by the new regime."
FreeOregon,,,,"Why believe anything Washington or Kiev say? ..None of the announced perfidious acts attributed to the Great Bear the West fears have proven true...So far Putin and Russia have acted with restraint in the face of US, EU and Ukrainian hysteria...And why not? ..Ukraine is a basket case. The US and the EU are bankrupt and cannot solve their own internal and economic challenges...Russia need do nothing and Ukraine will collapse. ..So far, with the possible exception of Germany, Western aid has been illusory. Only the Russians have delivered actual humanitarian assistance. They are, after all, next door, so why not?..It's doubtful any of the vociferous protagonists actually want Ukraine. It's army is incompetent. It's soils have been squandered and destroyed. It's population is aging, confused, and living in the past. It will be an expensive dependency for any entity that actually claims it.",,,,,,,,,

Any attempt to break out of that will meet with Russian opposition, even if Russia's economy is also shaky due to Western punishment. Mr. Putin will not budge..The longer this situation persists, the more chance that Russia will carve out more of Ukraine as separate pro-Russian enclaves, not because it wants to, but just out of momentum..A Russian federation would be acceptable to Mr. Putin, but probably not in the form that the US and West would agree to..Time, in spite of economic pressure is on Russia's side.","The fact that Mr. Putin achieved or has been offered a far better deal than he deserves proves his success. He can basically continue what he has been doing, as Russians do not have to be withdrawn since they have never been in Ukraine, as it were..Mr. Putin also knows that the West will not arm Ukraine, unless it wishes to risk all out war and Ukraine will lose..So it is imperative for the West to keep his (i.e. Mr. Putin's) feet to the fire, that would seem to be a joke.","Countries do what is in their self-interest, or what they perceive as such. this is the case even in humanitarian concerns..One country's humanitarian concerns may not be anothers.  or what one country perceives as humanitarian may be perceived as something else by someone else..The US seemingly does not understand Putin's head, which granted is not easy to understand. His humanitarian interests and concerns are different than those of the US..But Putin seems to have some type of ideology beyond pragmatism, which is also relative..Not doing anything stupid is what you twll your young child and not how you run a super-power.","The Russians have been involved in Syria for 40 years, even when Syria was theoretically non-aligned. Hafaz el-Assad, father of the Bashar learned to fly fighters in the Soviet Union. The Soviets became the major arm suppliers of Syria. ..When the Soviet Union broke up, Syria lost its major supporter and arms supplier. Mr. Putin is now taking advantage of US lack of determination to force his way back into Syria. This explains Mr. Putin acting now...Mr. Myers is certainly correct that Mr. Putin fears spring anywhere because it might spread to Russia, but Syria is a special case. The US handed Syria to Mr. Putin on a silver platter and as an added bonus he gets to embarrass Mr. Obama (again).","That was easy..Now everybody can go home..The Europeans avoid imposing economic sanctions on Russia which would lose money for them..The Russians avoid a diplomatic confrontation and the US actually appears to be doing something. And on top of this everybody condemns extremism, racism, religious intolerance, including anti-Semitism. This winning negotiating team should be sent to all hot spots. (Actually this is the group that kept Bashar al-Assad in power)..Of course the amnesty applies only to armed groups that leave public buildings they have been occupying.

He is apparently seeking hegemony in the Middle East and the US and the Obama administration are for the most part allowing him to achieve this goal. ..Russia does have an interest in fighting ISIS, but it is different than that of the US. Mr. Putin fears their influence on other Islamic groups or their expansion into the Muslim Caucasus, i.e. Russia. ISIS is in their back yard. They also see Mr. Assad as today still relevant in that fight. It was reported that the Russians offered the US and West a deal to remove Mr. Assad in 2012 and the West spurned the offer.

I guess that he too sees that now as Russian...Is there any message that can unite East and West? It is enough enough to draw a unifying vision of the future. Rather one should ask if it is possible for the two Ukraines under any circumstances to function as one country? ..The NYT reported a number of days ago that the Obama administration has written off Mr. Putin and does not think that it is possible to work with him and feels that long term historical processes or economic sanctions will provide a better way to deal with him...Unfortunately, in the real world, there will be no solution to Ukraine unless it is done together with Mr. Putin. He may not be nice and it may be more pleasant to ignore him and hope he will just go away, but this will just not happen. If he is does not agree then it will not work.

His move into Syria was preceded by Qassem Suleimani's trip to Russia.  This suggests his moves are as much about Iran as they are about Syria.  ..In his recent 60 Minutes interview, Putin spoke of what a terrible tragedy the breakup of the Soviet Union was.  This is another very telling indicator...I would suggest it is possible that Putin's real endgame is all about the Baltic States, the Ukraine and possibly, eventually, Eastern Europe.

Jason Bourne,,,,IT'S NAIVE in the extreme to ask Putin to use his influence to free the monitors since he ordered their capture and all the thugs who took over the buildings are Russian soldiers. Elvis is in the building but life goes on as normal outside. There is no insurrection - by Ukrainians that is.,"Putin said yesterday that he has no intention of invading Ukraine. You can take that to mean that he has every intention of invading Ukraine. This is a replay of 1938. Although he lacks Hitler's charisma he is behaving in a similar way - stalling for time, running rings around western leaders and doing exactly as he pleases. His plan is to reunite the slavic people in an attempt to boost his popularity in Russia. He also wants to be remembered as a great man of history even though he doesn't measure up. Appeasement did not work in 1938 and it will not work now. It is time to give the bully a bloody nose. It is our duty to save the Ukrainians including the Crimeans from the goons who are trying to take them over. The US has technical superiority and should use it.  The time for talking is over.",To the people here saying that we shouldn't get involved. That is exactly what many were saying when Hitler was annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia. The line about Sevastopol being Russia's only warm water port is beloney. If Russia wanted a naval station on the Black sea it could build one on its own coastline. Crimea is majority Russian because they were transplanted there by the dictator Stalin. Putin is an economic failure. Where are the Russian consumer products? I don't see any. In the soviet era you could at least buy a russian watch. Now you can't buy anything made there because they make nothing. It's Saudi Arabia with snow. A one trick pony. He sees militarism as his only way to make a mark.,"Serious sanctions should have been applied long ago for the invasion of Crimea. Give Putin an inch and he will take a mile. As for Europe, he needs them more than they need him. Russia's economy is a one trick pony because to be brutally honest, Russians are just not very inventive people. What have they given the world in the modern era? An assault rifle and a petrol bomb.",Russia has just been using the negotiations to buy time to supply the rebels. When are we going to stand up for freedom and take some action? This is so much like the interwar policy of appeasement towards Hitler. It's never going to work. Period. Putin's obvious endgame is to carry out ethnic cleansing in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. All non-ethnic Russians will be expelled or eliminated. This is what happens when you let rabid nationalists off the leash.,The NYT editorial board is being just a little naive here. Putin is not looking for peace. His aim is to gain territory like in Crimea. All wars are about real estate. Putin wants to acquire it by shedding as little Russian blood as possible and that is why he has others doing the fighting for him. And therein lies the key. Once Russians start dying it's a completely different ball game. Military action is unavoidable if we want to end this.,"I wonder whether the US and EU are prepared for a pre-emptive military strike from Russia. Impossible? They didn't expect an airliner to be shot down either, otherwise they would have re-routed all of them around Ukraine. Putin is like a cornered rat right now and is obviously mentally unstable. So expect anything.","The EU and US have to work towards the goal of having Putin replaced by someone reasonable. Otherwise the events of the last few months will be repeated over and over. He is not going to change and is clearly determined to restore some utopian fantasy he has about the USSR which doesn't include having to stand in line all day to get a loaf of bread. Unfortunately, this means making life harder for ordinary Russians by isolating and shunning them. It also entails increasing military spending to stand up to the Russian threat.","The protesters look like they could be ex-cons. Maybe Putin let them out of prison in return for stirring up trouble in Ukraine. Remember, he is KGB trained in the dark arts. Russians lost their moral compass after the revolution in 1917 and have never got it back. In their world anything goes - lies, sedition and reneguing on agreements included.","Putin talks about all the Russian blood shed in the Crimea, inferring that is the reason it belongs to Russia. Well, there was rather a lot of French, Turkish and British blood spilt there too, including most of the famous Light Brigade in the battle of Balaclava. So, by his logic, the Crimea must belong to all these countries too."

Danram,,,,"If Putin the Thug gets away with crushing Ukraines new democratic experiment and unilaterally redrawing the borders of Europe, every pro-Western country around Russia will be in danger...Exactly right, Mr. Friedman. Now please tell this to the spineless, laughably unqualified empty suit that you and the New York Times supported for president not once but twice.  Putin is laughing at his repeated empty threats and his belief that sanctions alone will change Russian behavior. ..This country needs to start providing the Ukrainian military with the very best weapons systems that we have and we need to start giving them the very best satellite position intel that we can obtain. We should have done this a year ago, but there can be no excuse for failing to do so now. ..The leaders of the west are fond of saying There is no military solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Well, Putin thinks there is, and he is busy pursuing it. The west needs to get its collective head out of the sand.","Thank you, Mr. Cohen. You are, of course, 100 correct...The only thing that will stop Putin is a sharp punch in the nose. The west should give Ukraine the arms it needs to defeat the separatists and if Putin then responds by sending in more of his own forces, the west should intervene directly with our own military might...Putin only respects strength. He laughs at economic sanctions and will not cut a peace deal unless he believes that the west is prepared to go to war against him. Anyone who seriously believes otherwise is either delusional or a fool...But he also knows that his armed forces would be shredded in any open conflict with NATO and that such a defeat would probably spell the end of his regime...So NATO and Ukraine hold the trump cards here. All that's needed is the will to play them, will that's been sadly lacking in Washington and Brussels so far.","Of course, now that Ukraine has a democratically elected government, produced by two national elections that independent observers proclaimed to be both free and fair, will Putin respect their authority and stop making trouble there? ..Not a chance...This article is far too charitable to Putin. He is nothing but a totalitarian thug, no matter what excuses he may give. He's gone into Syria for two reasons:..1) He knows that his Ukrainian gambit has failed and he needs something new to distract his people from the mess that he's making of things in Russia..2) As long as Assad is in power, he knows that the proposed gas pipeline from Qatar to Turkey through Syria will never be built. If it is built, the floow of gas to Europe from Qatar will significantly weaken the position of Gazprom. With energy prices in the tank, Russia desperately needs that revenue, now more than ever.",Hmmmm ... Didn't Putin also assure us a month ago that there were no Russian forces in Crimea?..I wouldn't believe Putin's Kremlin if they told me what day of the week it was. They're nothing but a pack of shameless liars. All of them...And yet what has our glorious leader done in response to this latest Russian incursion? ..Absolutely nothing of consequence...It's utterly pathetic.,"Let's not kid ourselves, OK? The only sure-fire way to back Putin off is to deploy robust US and NATO air power to Ukraine and the Black Sea and then let Putin know, in no uncertain terms, that if he send his tanks and APCs across the Ukrainian border they WILL be used! Putin is nothing but a two-bit thug, just like those who serve him. The only thing that bullies like Putin understand and respect is the possibility that they might get their butts kicked. I wish that this wasn't the way of the world, but it is and we ignore that fact at our peril.","The best way to guard against Putin escalating the confrontation is for the west to arm the Ukrainians to the friggin' teeth with the very best anti-armor and anti-aircraft weapons systems that we have. Also, we should send advisors to show Ukrainian troops how to use them. ..The Ukrainians don't want us to do their fighting for them. All they want is the means to make it a fair fight. ..The objective in all of this is to make Putin understand that any further attempted land grabs will result in massive casualties that he won't be able to hide from his people.","Has Russia left Crimea?  No...Have Russian troops left southeastern Ukraine?  No...Has Putin pulled back his tens of thousands of battle-ready troops from Ukraine's border?  No...So with all due respect, I think it's a tad early for Mr. Friedman to be declaring victory.","President Obama said at a news conference on Friday that NATO would uphold the countrys sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and right to defend itself. ..Obama is really good at making statements. The problem arises when it's time to actually back them up. ..I fail to see how refusing to provide the Ukrainian military with anything more menacing than blankets, MREs and sleeping bags is upholding Ukraine's right to defend itself...Barack Obama is a pathetic weakling, so is Angela Merkel, and Vladimir Putin knows it...The US military could end this war and kick Russia out of Ukraine in 48 hours if we had a real Commander-In-Chief with the guts to give the orders. Instead, for the next two years we're stuck with a celebrity whose sole area of competence seems to be fundraising. ..The damage that Barack Obama has done will take years to undo. He's a national embarrassment.",The only reason Putin has been able to enjoy any success at all is because of the cowardice and gullibility of the current political leadership in America and the EU.,"This is an excellent column. Polls have shown that no more than 30-35 of Ukrainians in the far eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk would prefer to be part of Russia. In other eastern cities such as Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the figure is in the 20s ... and these polls were taken before Russia invaded the Crimea last week. ..Many western media sources are assuming that just because someone lives in eastern Ukraine and speaks Russian as their primary language, it means that they would prefer to be part of Russia. That is simply not true...I strongly suspect that this is why Putin has sent his troops in western Russia back to their barracks. He knows that trying to move into eastern Ukraine would elicit a far different response than his move into the Crimea. The Ukrainian army would fight him and millions of ordinary Ukrainians would pick up their weapons and head for the front lines. Russia's army could probably take eastern Ukraine anyway, but the Ukrainians would make them bleed for every mile and there's no way that Russia would be able to hold on to it for the long haul...Also, even though it hasn't been reported on the news yet, I wouldn't be at all surprised if certain NATO air assets, like American Apache attack helicopters, have very quietly been moved into Ukraine over the past week.  ..Putin may have won the Crimea, but as a result of his invasion the other 90 of Ukraine is now probably permanently out of his reach."
"David L, Jr.",,,,"The What if Russia escalates? argument is the most annoying argument in history. The military power of the two countries, Ukraine and Russia, is already one-sided. For Putin to escalate would force him to show his hand even more blatantly than he already has. And we know he's trying to hide from the Russian people exactly what's been going on in Eastern Ukraine. The Let's do nothing but talk strategy is parlous with Mr Putin...He's going to get the impression, if he hasn't already, that he can do literally anything he wants because he knows the West is in no mood for a military confrontation, much less one with a state armed with atomic bombs. He's trying to find out, and he might have already found out, how much he can get away with. This business is not going away anytime soon; and I've thought from the beginning that it's not about Crimea or the Donets Basin. I think that Kiev (Mother of Russian Culture) holds a romantic importance in the eyes of Putin and other Russian fascists: You have to understand, George, that Ukraine is not even a country...They will weaken Ukraine and wait. If it starts to show signs of life, they'll enfeeble it some more -- if they're allowed to. What they dread more than anything is a democratic, law-abiding, prosperous Ukraine. They need a terminally ill patient for whom they can provide hospice care...(Look at some of these comments. Thanks, Prof Cohen.)","That NATO expansion provoked or caused this is the dumbest argument I've ever heard. Russia did not feel threatened by NATO. That's just a line invoked as justification for a land-grab. A marionette lost support when he reneged on westward-orientation, felt threatened, panicked, fled to Russia...Nuland engineered the whole thing! US-backed coup! LOL...I think you're basically correct here, though I'm not sure how much of this the Russian population will stand, especially if economic hardships pick up pace. People often point out how popular Putin is at the moment, but public opinion is fickle and can and does turn on a dime. No one wants to live in a country where Putin rules and the people are his serfs...The worst thing the US can do is exactly what the far-Left America-hating socialists want us to do: nothing. And sanctions, while important, are not nearly enough with someone like Vladimir Putin; and it seems that perhaps the White House now recognizes this. If people want democracy and the rule of law, they should have it. America didn't force Ukraine to want to join Europe. The Ukrainians chose that direction for themselves. It is Putin who would deny them their choice.","Ah, yes. The ole cease-fire without firing actually ceasing...Fareed Zakaria says arming Ukraine will only provoke the Kremlin. But hasn't it already been provoked? Who believes the Ukrainians can actually defeat the Russians, he asks, rhetorically. But people defending their homelands can achieve remarkable things, and, besides, he would've said the same thing about Afghanistan. (I doubt Ukraine will become a haven for Islamists.) He says that those who deem economic sanctions ineffective claim, by extension, that Vladimir Putin is irrational. Do they? Personally, I accept that Putin is rational, but not that he is primarily motivated by economic or national security concerns. According to the Tsar, Ukraine is not even a country. Novorossiya and all that...Zakaria also says that helping Putin's prey defend itself will be no hindrance to Putin. Yes, because not helping it has been so fruitful. . . . Why would an irrational actor, he asks, respond to a supposedly unserious military threat when he won't respond to sanctions that ravage Russia? But the point is not what Putin will or will not hypothetically respond to; the point is, What will force him to alter course? The best answer: lots of Russian bodybags being sent home AND crippling economic sanctions...Anne Applebaum thinks this may end with a demilitarized zone and entail a kind of neo-Berlin Wall, and that perhaps we'll have to do with western Ukraine what we did with West Germany. Not inconceivable, that.","Mearsheimer's piece is trash. I agree with Roger. Zbig was saying, you know, what if, in a day, Russians plant themselves in Riga? In Tallinn? The response will be well, that sucks, but they have atomic weapons. That myth-minded nostalgic revanchists in the Kremlin have nukes at their disposal is disturbing. But does that therefore mean that they can rearrange the map of Eastern Europe at will? And Stephen Cohen is more absurd than Mearsheimer: Putin didn't create the kleptocracy, true -- he just helped perfect it. Putin isn't responsible for Russian fossil fuel-dependency, true -- he just did nothing to help diversify the economy and make it dynamic; in fact, he did the reverse. And Putin is not better (whatever that means) than the autocrats of Russian history. You can't pluck people out of their specific circumstances, nor judge the past by the morality of the present. Even so, Alexander II was a superior human being...I recently listened to Alexandr Dugin and Francis Fukuyama discuss democracy, and Mr. Dugin seems to think there are multiple human natures and that Russians are somehow different (in cherishing the collective above the individual) than westerners, not just in terms of culture, but in terms, apparently, of biology. There's precedent for this in Russian history (see esp. Walicki's A History of Russian Thought), but not the anthropological twist. This is not a national security venture; this is a quasi-theological quest to fulfill Russian destiny.","Stop asserting that Assad should be kept in power because his army, backed by Russian aid, is the best chance, apart from U.S. combat troop-deployment, for defeating the Islamic State. Syrians will not permit that, even if we were to disgracefully condone it. And why are we talking about Russia as if it is our equal? If Putin doesn't want Assad to be removed from power, so what? Tell him to go have a cry about it and hand him a box of Kleenexes...Some people find U.S. power to be arrogant and boorish just because it exists, irrespective of how, or even if, it is used. I don't care. For example, Bill Appledorf, dorf of apples, in the comments section of today's editorial on this topic, said that America was acting like God. Well, God says Assad can't stay. And God, on that issue, doesn't care what Russia thinks...If we're going to talk or partner with Russia, we have to set certain parameters pertaining to what a future Syria must look like (human rights, democracy, free expression). Minimally, Russia must be made to understand that Assad has to go, that it is not feasible for him to stay at this point, that his presence prevents conflict deescalation -- and only then can we discuss the future of the Syrian state...And we should stop saying that the people of the Middle East aren't fit to live under civil regimes or shouldn't be allowed the same rights we share here at home. This is fatuous. Democracy can work there, can work everywhere. In time, it will.","My assessment is ex parte. I care little what motivates Putin, and I'm bushed listening to Obama opine, over and over again, that Putin is acting out of weakness. If a pansy kicks Schwarzenegger in the testicles in order to double him over, it works. And if the Terminator never responds, what's the conclusion? It could well be said about the Iranians that their quest to acquire atomic weapons is a sign of weakness. Does that then mean we needn't worry?..If Putin sends warplanes into Syria, as he has, and they obliterate American-backed fighters, as they have, is this okay? Putin believes that, provided he's adequately furtive, he can do anything he wants; maybe he's right. If he doesn't care about financial sanctions and he doesn't believe his (much brawnier) adversary is willing to stand up to him, then what, pray, keeps him from chowing down until he's satiated, assuming he ever is?..If Obama is glad to allow Putin to push the United States to the sidelines in Syria, he might say so. But he shouldn't sneer at those who have greater interventionist inclinations vis--vis this conflict than he does. Some of the Republican candidates' rhetoric is accurate. Putin would not be doing this unless he was convinced that he could get away with it. And with this president, evidently he can. Putin will not start a war with America, and we have goals in Syria. Those are two facts; here's an opinion: If he obstructs our objectives, he must understand that we will blow him out of the sky.","That's right, the Holodomor...Good stuff here. I completely agree. What Russia is doing is intolerable and the fact that they're doing it with such seeming insouciance and near impunity is almost surreal. Samantha Power was suggesting an international coalition to ensure the territorial integrity of Ukraine; such a coalition should've been ready and in-country almost the very second Yanukovych decided to high tail it out of town, in order to obviate the very circumstances now unfolding. There seems to be a consensus that military force is off the table (just read the editorial). One wonders what terminology should be employed to delineate the actions the Russians are now engaged in...Will they move across the eastern border as well? If so, I'm sure they'll use proxies and propaganda in order to justify it. And if they do, will we stop them? What CAN'T Putin do if we aren't prepared to send a contingent to help the Ukrainian army protect their nation's sovereignty? Vladimir Putin is not about to initiate a shooting war with the United States of America  Western Europe. And it's pretty evident that he doesn't take verbal communication especially seriously. Maybe it's time for another form of communication...Let's not play word games: There was a popular uprising against authoritarian kleptocratic rule, and the PM fled the country--hardly a military coup.

But how will you explain that 5 biggest Ukrainian cities (Donetsk, Kharkov, Dniepropetrovsk, Odessa and Zoprozhye), totally 6.5M people (twice Kiev population) for the whole 3 weeks didn't born anything except 200-2000 person mini-Maydans? In the same time pro-Yanukovich rallies in those cities (including one organized by Communists who are not in power) counted 20-40K people in each city. This shows everything. And please take into account that South-East population doesn't love Yanukovich because he is renegade, he did not make anything he promised - no official Russian language, no union with Russia and Belarus, etc. So this shows the hatered to West Ukrainian Maydan nationalists is greater than hatered to renegade Yanukovich. As for improving our economy in EU, please explain why Bulgaria with the same level of salaries didn't come to prosperity? EU market is several times more concurrent than Russian one. Any company coming to Russian market has biggests profits ever - see Danone, Unilever, BP experience. Also Ukraine has trade deficit with EU which will only explode after sighning Association.

History is prologue and there are striking parallels between the disingenuous rehtoric used by Putin now and Hitler in the late 30s.  The  reported reluctance of other EU members to provide an appropriate military response tit for tat with Putin is required if other EU members value their independence and sovereignty.  ..The axiom is when you mislay your trust you will pay a price.  The longer you refuse to acknowledge your mistake the higher the price becomes.  Western EU members have mislaid their trust in energy and other economic trade relations with Putin and the bill for doing so is coming due. It is a modern form of Chamberlain for EU members to believe conceding to Mr. Putin's  military annexation of eastern Ukraine will satisfy Russia's appetite for defacto satellite states.  The appropriate truism is if you give a rat a cookie, it will demand a glass of milk. ..It was well know the separatists were Russian military surrogates.

What Merkel and the US realize, and the rest of NATO  EU continues to evade accepting economic dependency on Russia leads inextricably to despotism."

God only knows what they've been told or promised by the GRU and the FSB...Putin can't speak the language of Russian imperialism and then disavow any responsibility for Russian ex-FSB members who act out his words.","It's the coup scenario that is simply not true...The only coup on Ukrainian soil was in Crimea, where little green men who Putin now admits were Russian special forces, stormed the Crimean parliament, prevented elected members from entering, and installed as leader of Crimea a pro-Russian separatist whose party won less than 5 of the vote in the previous election...Similar patterns were repeated in Donetsk and Luhansk - Russian soldiers (this time on holiday is the line we are expected to believe) storm and take over regional governments, and institute an armed thugocracy...The aggressors here are Russia, plain and simple.

When he was elected - a moderate, and not an extreme right-winger as the Russian media had been going on and on about - Putin knew he had to stir up the pot before the Ukrainians could actually sit down and solve their problems...So, the Russian military support is increased and we see more Russian fighters streaming in to defend their brothers ..Why does NATO even exist?  Because those Warsaw Pact nations have been invaded by Russia before, they don't trust Russia, and apparently they are right....","The evidence is in the news daily, on dozens of television channels and newspapers...

That was Ukrainians choosing the European path (with all its flaws) over the Russian path.  And I strongly suspect it caught the USA by surprise as much as anyone else. ..Only Putin believes that the USA was responsible for Maidan - and that's because he doesn't think Ukraine is a real country, so he can't imagine that millions of Ukrainians would try to stand up for their country rather than doing what Mother Russia tells them to do."

Grant,,,,"Where Putin proclaimed a red line and defended it, the U.S. Administration proclaims red lines and then erases them.  Better yet, they send the clown princes of foreign policy misjudgment, Senator John McCain, topped off with Vice President Bombast Biden, who can now permanently kiss off delusions of the Presidency.  The side show began with Secretary Kerry who demonstrates daily why he never had a realistic chance at being President...Crimea is connected to Russia via border and culture over centuries:  History lesson one, U.S. Hegemony is over, lesson number two.  Borders get redrawn without U.S. interference: lesson number three.  World tension increases due to incoherent foreign policy under President Obama is the final lesson.","Nice try with the headline, but this is just more smoke and mirrors intended for Secretary Kerry to save face for the Easter holiday getaway while it is business as usual with Putin in the drivers seat and President Obama stowed silently away in the trunk.","Regardless of the current devolution of order occurring in what appears to be the remnants of Ukraine, pointing finger at Putin is neither accurate nor productive, but instead revealing and revisionist.  The state of Ukraine is a direct result of American influence and support for the usurpation of control in the overthrow of the elected legitimate government...This revolt succeeded largely due to backing from the Obama Administration and has resulted in gains for Russia amidst greater instability throughout the region and to N.A.T. O. The end game of Crimea now Russian territory was neither anticipated nor halted and again points to an incoherent U.S. Department of State and American foreign Policy.  This entire fiasco can be laid at the foot of the President, not blame shifted to Putin, who is merely acting pragmatically in the interests of Russia.","I am certain that President Putin will politely bow to the scolding of the American President who continues to demonstrate a lack of depth and comprehension of foreign policy and Eastern European history with alarming alacrity.  It is certainly assuring to have such an astute U.S. President and Secretary of State to orchestrate change around the world in such an incoherent manner as this, wishing that Vladimir Putin would refrain from further militaristic provocation, lest American resolve for the prior Clinton commitment to Ukraine be revealed as hollow...It is already being framed as a win for Obama for merely Russias annexation of Crimea and not the whole of Ukraine.  President Obama commands and the world snickers.  Soon the games begin further east and it will be time for another domestic distraction.","Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed by a sophisticated supersonic ballistic missile, not your ordinary rebel weaponry.  The public, the media or both have been dumbed down to the point of not caring to follow the obvious trail back to the launch site. With a U.S. President and Administration that dont want to wade in treacherous waters and would rather punt than take an honest stand, this tragedy will pass and soon go unnoticed; as without question the shrinking of American diplomatic skill and credibility indeed have consequences...Empty threats and painting red lines with disappearing ink have exposed a President who commands no international respect. This American President has no effect on the world stage as it presents no opportunities to polarize and divide and instead merely beckons leadership and resolve.  And for that the American President has no answer.  Of this Putin is well aware and prepared.","While Obama blinks Putin flexes. The issue is legitimate sphere of influence versus self-appointed.  Russia historically and geographically has a legitimate relationship with Ukraine while the U.S. does not.  Hegemony can be a bear when there are no means to carry it out, particularly when ignorance is the primary content and style of diplomacy.  Secretary Kerry has displayed a less than deft hand in Ukraine as he has in Syria and wherever the world stage intersects with rival interests, particularly those involving Russia...Aside from not honoring commitments made by former President Clinton as regards the Ukraine, U.S. foreign policy the world over now appears inept and disjointed when challenged, exposing both a lack of resolve and more importantly a lack of purpose philosophically.  The current U.S. Administration has demonstrated little to no expertise involving anything aside from international trade conglomerates and relationships and agreements already established.  This incessant vacillation undermined by a naive foreign policy appears directionless, not just within the shores of the U.S., but in every capital of the world.  It will continue by design to increase instability globally and diminish American influence.","The Obama Administration is now fully exposed in a lack of coherence regarding foreign policy.  Believing in globalism yet practicing isolation America now flounders.  Putin, in contrast, recognizes that borders are fluid and history is written by the victors.  He also recognizes that history occurs in real time with human movement, not via empty scripts rehearsed for dwindling believers. Inaction is costly...Putin is acting solely in the best interests of Russia, making strategic decisions to enhance the economic well-being of his nation. Recognizing incompetence within the West he is proactive and pragmatic not overtly aggressive. Putin is perhaps bringing greater stability to the region.  ..The west, mistakenly clambering for legitimacy immediately following the usurpation of control over an elected government in Ukraine, connotes collusion, the very thing they now claim of Putin. Credibility once lost cannot be used as weapon or negotiating leverage.  This is a simple lesson in cause and effect.","With pragmatism and reasoned diplomacy on holiday, the stage is now set with those clamoring for fame, wanting their moment in the sun.  Inviting a brighter flash of light, Secretary Kerry recklessly demonstrates daily why he was a poor Presidential nominee, by declaring immediate aid and denouncing what he determines is an unjust invasion of national sovereignty.  Denying recent U.S. history, he pontificates in imperious tone resolving nothing and ratcheting up tension.  Apparently no longer respecting elections and the democratic process, Secretary Kerry again chooses insurgency, immediately tagging them with legitimacy while Putin is correct in assessing legitimacy to ousted president Viktor F. Yanukovych.  Elections have consequences, but can be rectified.  Anarchy often cannot...Likewise, from the U.S. President comes more sarcastic verbiage that is naive, shortsighted and unhelpful.  Asking for Russias hand with Syria, he now slaps it dissolving a needed relationship...Suddenly the EU rushes in with wallet and conditional blank check with the IMF standing in the wings.  Apparently social media has caused an acceleration of news, but not real events or reasoned thinking, just emotional reacting.  World stability suffers from this knee jerk U.S. Administration continually demonstrating no strategic aspect to foreign policy or international relations, and always a step behind caught with its pants down.","Ukraine, with its linked language, culture and history remains in Russias sphere of influence, not that of the west. The issue in not a messianic Putin whose Russian exceptionalism paradigm is strangely identical to that of the U.S. before the current Administrations deconstruction campaign; it is whether promises of U.S. protection for Ukraine sovereignty, brokered during the Clinton Administration in exchange for elimination of nuclear stockpiles, are genuine or just a wink and a nod...A short reading of history will bear out the lack of American exceptionalism regarding foreign policy as well as international integrity.  Putin, rather than messianic, is instead pragmatic, taking a long view very certain of a path to power and influence.  The opposite is true now in America where a rudderless ship has been floundering since the 21st century with no sense of purpose or mission other than to meddle and intervene where it is not wanted or needed...While America sleeps and refuses to utilize its energy resources, Russia has a growing fleet of icebreakers and cargo ships dominating the Arctic Sea, the eventual preeminent waterway for oil transport and home to the worlds largest fishery.  The more dangerous messianic loose cannon occupies the White House not the Kremlin, and he is proving far more dangerous to world stability than Putin.","President Obama reading from a script hurling marshmallows at President Putin is not a good image to project. It again demonstrates no personal grasp of foreign events and denies the fact that the Crimean people freely chose to be aligned with and essentially annexed by Russia.  To further expose what has become glaring incoherence, President Obama chooses to engage in a ludicrous game of nonexistent sanctions impacting only a handful of individuals.  The Russians answer in in identical ceremonial fashion in a bizarre kabuki dance of shadow puppets that quickly disappear as they are lobbed about with no substance...It would serve the world better if President Obama would quietly refrain from further comments regarding Ukraine and Crimea, making no pronouncements about what is and is not proper international conduct (drones anyone).  It is time to tuck the tail between the legs and just roll over as rolled over is the operative event that took place. Each press conference is more disappointing than the one that preceded it and exposes the U.S. as a rudderless ship about to be rechristened the Titanic. Experience matters as does knowing that Hollywood produces the stuff of dreams, not reality."
Stephen Miller,,,,"Putin is a doer.  He is a patriot who helped his country through a terrible crisis and did it well.  ..Georgia started that war you mentioned, and the Islamic militants invaded Dagestan, forcing Russia to respond and eventually invade Chechnya.  ..Hezbollah is quite popular in Lebanon, since they were the only force willing to stand up to the Israelis, and is a major elected party in the government, not a terrorist group...Support for Assad may prop up a brutal regime, but it is better than the alternatives.  Your view of the world is skewed by you desire to see a devil in the Kremlin, when the reality is far more nuanced.",Dictators are not elected by huge majorities and supported by popular acclaim.  The term you should use for Putin is demagogue.,"Obama obviously realizes he looks like the indecisive, incompetent, powerless, lame duck that he is, especially in comparison to the brazen, decisive, wildly popular prime minister of Russia.  Putin has a plan that makes sense.  Obama wants to arm moderates that don't exist.  Putin is in control and has massive domestic support.  Obama is afraid - and it shows.","Sorry, but you could not be more wrong.  Putin has a very savvy economic team that put together a wise and quite large sovereign wealth fund.  Poor oil prices have slowed the economy a lot, but Putin has nothing to do with that.  Income in Russia has tripled since he came on the scene 15 years ago.  That is pretty impressive stuff, and why he is so well supported in Russia.  As for corruption, much remains to be done, but it is miles from the kleptocracy that Yeltsin left.",Putin has shown very little interest in an expensive war that would likely prove unpopular over time.  Putin is not stupid - certainly not as stupid as we have been.,"Putin is a politician who knows his job better than anyone else.  Kerry and Obama are totally outclassed.  ..You couldn't get into the Olympics because you didn't go...The lesser of the evils is letting Ukrainians work it out for themselves.  It's a mess, and nobody in the US is qualified to tell them what to do.","If poker is the analogy, then Obama is bluffing with a lousy hand, and Putin knows it and keeps raising.  ..The US removed Hussein and the power vacuum in Iraq greatly enhanced the power of Iran and its allies.  We systematically undercut all Sunni power-sharing under Al-Maliki, and then act surprised when the Islamic State takes over Ramadi and Mosul.  Iran and Russia find themselves with enemies in common, and no reason at all to trust an America bent on military world domination.  US actions are so heavy-handed and hypocritical that much of the world will turn with admiration to those who have the guts to stand up to them.  That is why the Taliban, the Islamic State, and Putin are growing in popularity and power.  Somebody has to put exceptional America in its place.","If you think Putin ever has or ever will back down, then you haven't been paying any attention at all.","People love Putin because he is a winner.  It is very simple.  By the way, I'm sure Putin drinks Putin vodka, not Stolichnaya.","This article contradicts itself.  The title implies that Putin got the truce he wanted, but then the article says that the truce is almost verbatim one offered by Poroshenko.  So does the Times now think that Putin and Poroshenko are on the same side?  Or perhaps they are the same person?  The do both speak Russian and their names begin with P.  ..Again, the Times repeats the unproven and ridiculous invasion of Russian forces in Ukraine.  If there were Russian troops in the country, the terms of the truce would be focused upon that idea - and yet it isn't mentioned.  What is mentioned is a buffer zone to prevent the infiltration of weapons and men from Russia.  Russian speaking separatists getting supplies from a sympathetic country is not the same as an invasion, so stop pretending it is."

Putin -- unlike the Obama Administration -- resides in the real world  and knows the score far better then our Stateside overlords. Putin is leveraging the situation further to his advantage. Time is on his side. Ukraine will further fracture as IMF killer-austerity takes hold and Gazprom refuses to ship fuel to Ukraine until they cough up billions more in arrears....Putin, in fact, already has won. He has achieved his main goals of keeping NATO off his borders; and securing a warm water port for the Russian navy. The idea that Putin wants to conquer the Ukraine is a Western propaganda ploy. That was never in the cards.","A far more nuanced and realistic analysis of US- Russia relations than the usual bluster from DC and a chorus of braying press sycophants. Still, it does need to be said that Putin has drawn some bright red lines.  Putin's red line amount to a casus belli. So beware. ..Specifically, Russia will not tolerate NATO incursion right up to the border, especially when the US has sponsored a coup led by neo-Nazis who are already at each other's throats.","Putin deftly achieved his strategic aims in Ukraine: securing a warm water port in Crimea; and keeping NATO off the Russian doorstep. This was achieved at virtually no cost to him and his nation. Contrary to US propaganda, annexing Ukraine was never in the cards, so claims that threats and pressure from Washington forced Putin to change course are completely without any basis...Putin can now sit back and watch the Kiev government collapse under the weight of IMF killer austerity, and then deal from a position of alternatives to Western plunder...All this enrages the political class in DC who grow more reckless and aggressive by the day. But ties to Germany and France especially are frayed by abusive attitudes from the NSA, for example. There's little chance of a concensus penalizing Russia further. Obama, Kerry and Nuland were completely over matched in the Ukraine and Syria by V. Putin every step of the way. We have the Russian President  to thank for keeping the peace on many fronts.","Obama is doing the heavy lifting on that front. Smashing BNP in France for not kowtowing to the US State Department dictat is working wonders in souring the Franc0-American relationship, ambivalent as it is from the start...Insulting Frau Merkel in the Rose Garden and non-stop expose of NSA spying is a wonderful way to isolate Merkel from Industrialists and the Political Establishment who are both in sync with Putin and Russia. The US is increasingly despised as bankrupt, reckless and highly dysfunctional, which is quite advantageous to Putin...Meanwhile Putin has knitted together the makings of a Eurasian Alliance integrated with the BRICS nations. What does Washington have to offer? Complete devastation and chaos from Afghanistan to Damascus. Plus stagnation and hyperinflationary  dollar policies on the economic front...It's all topped off with a nasty totalitarian infrastructure that no one wants any part of.","This commentary is amateurish and irresponsible, a masterpiece of warmed over Cold War triumphalist mush.. NATO encroachment upon Russia is not an hallucination in Putin's head. Nor are blueprints for the dismemberment of Russia (the Brzezinski Plan)...These are existential issues for Russia. The installation of an unstable coup regime in Kiev well larded with bona fide neo-Nazi elements, with US financing and support, was a huge blunder. Without a strong change of policy the US NATO nations will be in for a severe shock resembling the Cuban Missile Crisis. ..Fortunately, it appears Obama is backing off aggressive actions against Russia, which may account for intense press attacks against him as well as a blatant specter of assassination directed against the President by the Perpetual War Party.","The Putin Doctrine has put an end to American Regime Change rampages, especially in the Middle East.

Nicolas Berger,,,,"All good points but it should be added that the current situation is not just a challenge for the West -- it also represents a historic setback for Russia...Strategically, Russia gained Crimea and perhaps part of the Donbass, but lost the rest of Ukraine. Prior to 2014, Ukrainians had mostly positive views of Russians, which gave Russia a strong influence over Ukrainian affairs. This goodwill has evaporated, and will not be revived for a very long time. In a way Russia lost Ukraine for a second time in 2014, after the formal independence of 1991, and this time for good. ..Secondly, the Russian defeat is tactical as well : the Donbass is now a wasteland, under the combined effect of industrial decay and the ongoing war, and it is now Russia that is saddled with its support. Its diplomatic push to have Ukraine support the breakaway regions is going nowhere, given Russia's effective control of the regions...So Putin faces an array of bad choices: 1) keep supporting Donbass (as well as Crimea) as the Russian economy faces its worst crisis in a decade; 2) abandon the breakaway regions, and face a nationalist backlash at home; or 3) escalate the conflict to carve out a more viable chunk of territory (possibly including a land bridge to Crimea) -- but then face a crippling new round of sanctions, and a military escalation that could spin out of control. ..While the situation is not ideal for Ukraine and the West, it is even worse for Russia.","He does: The Kremlin has seized control of the peninsulas media, taking Ukrainian TV channels off the air and replacing them with state-backed Russian ones...The fact that these people now get their news mostly from Russian state TV propaganda goes a long way towards explaining their current inclinations. ..For the same reasons, 80 of Russians still support Vladimir Putin in spite of his dubious foreign wars and the resulting crash of the Russian economy.","The direct occupation of countries is currently Russia's doing. The U.S. efforts for the last decade or so have been to pull out of the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, which were never planned to be long-term. By contrast, I don't expect the Russian occupation of Crimea (which Putin calls eternal) to end within my lifetime. Can anybody imagine even GW Bush calling the American presence in Iraq eternal ?..As for the bankers and the business people, the current problem rather how willing they are to cooperate with the worst regimes on the planet, including Putin's, if there is a bit of cash to be made in the process.","After exclusively watching Russian TV for one year, Crimeans now have a positive image of Russia -- not a surprise. ..But if this had been true a year ago (when Crimeans had access to both Russian and Ukrainian TV, as well as some foreign channels), Putin could have simply held a fair referendum on the annexation. ..Instead, as has been widely reported, only one side was allowed to campaign and the voting process was monitored by Russian soldiers and pro-Russian militias. The fact that Putin had to resort to such tactics puts a permanent question mark over any support the Crimeans my have had for annexation.","Russia has been struggling to gain a footing, so to speak, after the dissolution of what was an integrated set of states and the implosion of their economies of somewhere between 50-80..This doesn't explain why Russia would suddenly turn to foreign aggression just when its economy was picking up pace in the last 10-15 years. This might have been a good argument if current events had occurred in the late 1990's, but simply doesn't fit the present situation...The simple fact is that Putin had plenty of choice, and chose the path that offered both stability to his regime and hardship for Russia - and found it convenient to blame the West for the latter.","Why would the U.S. take pains to give Russia a hard time, when its main security challenges are halfway across the world in the Pacific ? Russia and Ukraine are not new markets to exploit, they are poor countries that have little to offer economically and were quite open to begin with. So why bother to inch NATO weaponry closer to Russia ? ..I have an alternate scenario: Russia, seeing the U.S. busy elsewhere, decided to try reconquering some Soviet territories which it had lost in 1991, betting that Europe would not dare react on it own. It could seem like a safe bet, especially with the added bonus that Putin would get to remain president for another couple of decades by blaming the U.S. for everything that could go wrong. Thankfully, the drop in the price of oil probably changed that calculation.","Thanks for the thoughtful article as usual. ..One thing that could have been emphasized is that the turning is first and foremost detrimental to Russia itself: a closed economy and locked-down society are not usually conducive to economic growth; and whatever economic partnership ends up being struck with China is likely to be less beneficial than the European trade it will replace (for instance the recent gas deal likely involved a discount on the price)...For that reason, one can still remain hopeful that eventually cooler heads will prevail and Russia will resume closer ties with Europe, backtracking on at least some of their recent provocations. However that looks unlikely while Putin is in power, which means the timescale may be quite long.","The article concludes by suggesting to start easing sanctions, but should we do this when one of the main motivations for these sanctions (The annexation of Crimea) will almost certainly not be reversed in the foreseeable future ? ..The current mess is almost entirely of Putin's doing, and therefore the choices we have are all bad: maintain (or increase) the sancitons, and we risk making Russia even more messy, jingoistic and unstable; ease them, and we are essentially endorsing the annexation, and giving Putin carte blanche for his next land grab (Estonia, maybe ?)...On balance the status quo is probably the least-bad option, but we should be prepared for a slow but steady deteriotation of both the Russian economy and its relations with the West, with unpredictable consequences.","If Russia voluntarily gave independence to all the former Soviet republics, why should we be worried that Russia plans to reoccupy them?..Because it did, of course -- Transdnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and recently Crimea and the Donbass are all regions belonding to former SSRs which Russia reoccupied on whatever pretexts it found expedient at the time. ..The deeper reason being that Putin and consorts believe the dissolution of the USSR to be both a mistake and a catastrophe, and are doing what they can to reverse it when possible.",
Jon Davis,,,,"Although Putin is smarter than all U.S. and European leaders combined (including all current presidential candidates from both parties), we do have a glimmer hope: Putin's arrogance.","It should be pretty easy to break up the EU. Germany's Angela Merkel is more allied to Putin than she is to the EU, while Britain's Cameron has never wanted the UK to be in the EU. Greece guards the EU eastern flank with the Muslim world, but the northern Europeans spit on the PIGS as they call Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain and contribute nothing to the onslaught of refugees reaching the islands and  beaches of Spain and Italy.","The European Union can't even agree on a common strategy to defend its southern borders from the flood of immigrants reaching Spain and Italy, and most northerners don't feel that they should have to pay taxes to protect the southern borders. And at a time when one might think that NATO is more important then ever (thanks to Putin's aggressive posturing as well as the establishment of the Islamic State on Turkey's border and in Libya), the European Community is pushing Greece...and Turkey...away...toward Russia.","Politics is on Putin's side..Western politicians are divided at every level, from nation to nation, all the way down to municipalities..Francis Fukuyama described us perfectly in The End of History? (1989):.The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, will be (i.e., has been) replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands. In the post-historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history.",Putin is living and telling the big lie: He wants to recreate the USSR and has been slowly ratcheting up Cold War 2.0..Putin is no more living and telling the big lie than is every Republican presidential candidates..The only thing that separates Democrats from Republicans is that most Democrats are too cowardly to tell the big lie.,Except Putin is smarter than Western leaders combined.,Putin could win the GOP nomination to be president of the U.S.,"This sounds great in theory, but the US shouldn't defend a continent unwilling to defend itself..Thousands of migrants are pouring over the southern border, and the northern countries continue to refuse to help the southern countries. The European Community encouraged Ukraine to break with Russia, but offered the Ukraine nothing in return. Greek leaders may have run their country badly, but current EU policy seems to be to drive Greece away from the EU and NATO. And Merkel regularly sucks up to Putin for the benefit of the German economy. Russians would be stupid to not exploit European's inherent weaknesses.",Putin is no worse than Dick Cheney.,"At the beginning of the last chapter of Walden (1854), Thoreau asks the reader, What does Africa  what does the West stand for? And the question is still relevant 161 years later...President Vladimir Putin has set himself up as the guardian of an absolutist culture against what Russia sees as the predatory and relativist culture of the West,  and in many ways, Mr. Putin, as well as the leaders of ISIS, are right. ..No, this does not mean that returning to an absolutist culture, as the U.S Republican Tea Party, Putin and ISIS demand will solve any problems in the 21st century...Nor does it mean that we can stop being, as Putin correctly observes, a predatory and relativist culture. In fact, Putin is the leader of a predatory and absolutist culture...But as Francis Fukuyama observed in The End of History? (1989), the West has ceased to be a culture based on The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, and we are now a culture based economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands...There is a lot to dislike about Putin, and ISIS...and we in the West. If I support the West, and oppose Putin or ISIS, it is primarily because the post-Historic values of the West serve me better than do the historic absolutist values of others."

The Sitting Elected Government of the Ukraine continued on doing its work and was never removed by force or fear. They dealt with his absence by filling the positions necessary..I assert based on what happened immediately after Yanukovich ran away, that Putin called him home so that he could claim ouster and justify the annexation of the Crimea as well as sending in commandoes to start the separatist actions in the east. All the forces he used and is using were in place before Yanukovich ever left...There is no separatist movement, there is no secessionist movement, there is only Russian commandoes, long term Russian moles and the unemployed, ignorant or avarice driven fools following them.",Rest assured that as soon as Putin has consolidated his gains and pre-placed soldiers for his next move he will start up the fight again..Has no one else noticed the systematic way he has taken Ukraine apart so far?.This is just an updated version of Hitler's lebensraum campaign.,"1. The government in Kiev has always been the legal authority. There was never any valid question of that..2, The people that remained in government after Yanukovych ran away were the elected officials who had been sitting with him working out with the protestors how to solve the problems. These people were mostly wholeheartedly, or at least passively pro Russian oligarch's themselves prior to Putin pulling the plug and calling Yanukovych home so he could start this phonyrebellion..3. The people in the east causing all this ruckus are lead by Russian soldiers and Russian agents who had been living in Ukraine as a kind of mole force for just such an occasion. If they love Russia so much they want to be citizens, then migrate &amp; go live there.","It was not a coup. The President Yanukovych turned coward and absconded from his post the sitting elected government has stepped in and taken over just as it would here. In fact it has twice in my lifetime..The only Pol who has liability here is McVain who went to the Maiden and declared the US was supporting them thus giving Putin the excuse he needed..The Iranians don't want war and in spite if them being fellow human beings the problem seems to be people like you finally accepting that fact about them not so much their reaction to being constantly abused..Ugly and wrong as it (and a lot of other things they have done) was the revolution and the hostage taking should have been expected for what we had been helping do to them for decades. They are not naturally nasty people but like us they will fight any way they can when pressed. It only looks like evil from this side of the equation, to them they are defending themselves and being normal people in the world.","1. The government in Kiev has always been the legal authority.

To that end he makes common cause with his erstwhile rival, Iran.  Obama?  He apparently doesn't understand this, or if he does, prefers to focus attention on normalizing relations with Cuba, a diplomatic side-show that only illustrates to the world that our enemies can outlast our resolve.  Bush at least, for all his bumbling and at a terrible cost, had the Iranians surrounded and consequently blunted Russian ambition in Central Asia.

Boris fashioned the modern, autocratic Russian presidency with a series of referenda, fully supported by the West, that gave him, among other things, power to dissolve parliament and thereby impose the West's shock therapy of fire-sale privatization that in turn spawned the new oligarchical Russian economy.  Now the Western press is just incredulous that Russian businessmen continue to support their president despite the pain of Western sanctions, and they see Putin's policy of propping up enterprises that would otherwise suffer as something quite sinister.  But after all, the EU is doing the same in promising to compensate those hurt by Russian agricultural boycotts - despite levels of public debt and deficits that already exceed their supposed self-imposed limits.","Syria and Assad are small potatoes; the real issue is the emerging Russia - Iran axis that will dominate the Middle East for the foreseeable future.

Sophia,,,,"Hint to Russian trolls: if you mention Victoria Nuland, everyone knows that you are a Russian troll. Victoria Nuland said one sentence that she liked one Ukrainian politician. How many sentences do you think Putin has said about the neo-nazi fascist junta? Or how many words of support do you think he gave to his boy Yanukovych.","To call the Yanukovych government democratically elected is an insult to democracy. Ukraine has never had (and probably does not still have) a democracy. Ukrainian politics was a corrupt cesspool of oligarchs and Yanukovych was the odious leader of the crew. During his tenure, he contributed nothing to the well-being of the Ukrainian people. As odious as Putin is, he has at least improved the quality of life of the average Russian (prior to 2014).","Your post could be rewritten to say: Russia has purposefully orchestrated this conflict with Russia to have yet another reason to utilize its military industrial complex. It must have numerous wars real or imagined in order to justify its existence. The last thing Putin wants is a peaceful responsible world. Just like the Russia could eliminate the daily senseless record homocide rate with domestic violence laws, Russia could promote peace by eliminating all foreign occupations and cutting our military budget by 95 and not interfere in any neighboring territories (or the arctic).","Maybe Putin should remove his forces from Ukraine's southeast. It has been shown repeatedly that Putin's special forces and para-military forces are in Ukraine. They are barely trying to hide it, but he is pulling the classic poison-you-with-plutonium and deny it was me. This is just straight psychotic. Unfortunately, he is winning the information war and successfully convincing many people, including some Times readers, that western liberals are somehow fascists. This is madness in all its forms.","So according to you. Putin didn't engage in a blatant land grab in Crimea? According to your Putin never declared southern and eastern Ukraine to be Novorossiya? According to you, Putin and the FSB never provided any support to the rebels? According to you, Akhmetov and Putin never had meetings in Russia right before the instability? According to you, the state controlled Russian media hasn't been spreading propaganda about purported fascists controlling all of Central and Western Ukraine? In your world, all of this is taken for granted. In mine, I see the facts before me and to say that Russia couldn't have avoided this by, let's say, doing nothing and not engaging in a covert war against the Ukrainian people, their land, and moreover their identity, is somehow very willfully blind of you and other members of the 30 ruble army.","Whenever someone mentions the NWO, it is usually an opportunity to ignore that person. Just because NATOThe WestNWOIlluminatiKnights Templar whatever might be had does not make their opponents good. Putin is a bad guy and does virtually everything that his apologists accuse NATO of doing (silencing dissent, using economic muscle to bully other countries, and use of military force to invade other countries).","Russia has no interest in Crimea or Ukraine. Russia's Black Sea fleet was not under threat in any form. Do you honestly think any Ukrainian president would have tried to kick it out. Russia does not own the Black Sea. Plenty of NATO countries have a right to it as well, such as Turkey. Everyone wanted Russian integration with the world order, but Putin wanted to cement his dictatorship and used tried and true nationalist means to achieve a moment of national insanity in Russia.","To say that Putin wants free democratic choice anywhere in Soviet Empire 2.0 is either disingenuous or naive. Putin wants people to agree with him. Those that do not get killed (Litvenko, Chechans, Ukrainians) or arrested (Navalny, Pussy Riot). There is no choice in Russia but to love Putin and the anccient Orthodox Church.","It is to me quite unbelievable that 70 years after Hitler's death, another nationalist socialist aggressor is again starting wars of conquest to seize bits of neighbouring states on the grounds that 'all germanrussian people belong within the Reich', and that the  great powers of europe dither, dissuss, make token sanctions and discuss and dither.....Have we really learned nothing at all? Must we learn all over again that such aggression must be stopped sometime and the bill is much less if it is done early on? That fascist like Putin understand but one language, force, that words mean nothing at all to them and that they are past masters at gulling the weak and self deluding?..I feel sick with shame and foreboding..Does anyone seriously think that Donestk is Herr Putin's last territorial demand?..In one way it is much worse than 1938. Then we were right to hesitate because the our strength was roughly 50:50 with theirs. Today, Nato outguns the russians 7:1 yet still we flinch..And the biggest laugh? That the arch appeaser this time round is - germany","First of all, this is not a civil war. This is a civil war in the same way that the US taking out Allende was a civil war. This is a war fomented, caused, and fought by a foreign power. That foreign power in Ukraine is Russia. There are tons of Russian weapons, Russians (no dispute about this, as there is tons of documentary evidence), and possibly Russian troops (some dispute if Russian regulars are fighting there or not) fighting there. Ask yourself whether it is possible for rebel forces to look like the Russian rebels do. Look at the FSA or the Kurdish fighters, then look at the modern T-72Bs, SA-13s, BMPs, Pantsirs, etc... the rebels have. To think that they are not armed by Russia is delusional. ..Ukraine has not fought this war well. They used unguided weapons and ultimately killed many civilians (of course, the Russians did as well). What they need, aside of precision weapons to defeat the Russian-backedRussian forces on a small level. They also need better generals and better training. However, what is most important, is that they need it fast. ..Ukraine does not deserve to be a buffer; no state does. The U.S. needs to help stop Putin before his imperialist aspirations get out of hand (they are already well on their way)."
caaps02,,,,Well you certainly have got Mr. Putin in with the the right people: Mr. Qaddafi and Mr. Hussain.,"Nobody is saying that Putin has TOTAL control over them,  but he is training, arming and sending them.  Every single poll ever taken post 1992 has shown that at least 70 of people are pro-Ukrainian,  and under 10 have expressed any interest in joining Russia.","Repeating over and over that the Right Sector is fascist does not make it so. THey are NOT fascist,  unlike Putin's ideologue Dugin.",Putin has not turned around yet.  He just made a phone call.,"-1-Putin will never agree to a neutral Crimea...-2- if Ukraine does not have a standing army,  Putin will invade it.  ..-3-Putin's invasion of Crimea is the kiss of death to any and international non-proliferation efforts.","If all Putin was interested in was Crimea,  he would have invaded it long ago.  As it is,  he wants all of Ukraine for his euro-asian project,  and he needs Ukraine to be run along the same way that Belarus is run in order not be be an example to Russians.","The problem is that it is the UK and Germany which could impose meaningful economic sanctions, not the US.  So far neither the UK nor Germany has shown any willingness to impose meaningful tough sanctions,  and Putin is betting that they will not.",what does Putin's popularity have anything to do with whether he has the right to invade Ukraine?  Which he has already done.,The people that Putin has set out to rescue are not Russian citizens.  They are Ukrainian citizens of russian ethnic origin.,"The vast majority of the people who perished due to the villainous policies of the 1930 perished under Putin's big hero, Stalin.  And if you have been following Russian media,  you would know that the comparison to Goebbels is more than apt and Putin's stated policy of invading neighbouring countries to protect ethnic Russian (and retaining the right to do so in the futur) is EXACTLY like some other villainous policies of the 30s.  It is in fact an insult to all the victims to let this happen again."
Reuben Ryder,,,,"Mr. Putin gets much more play than he deserves. Russia is hardly a world power. It's all about the nukes, and Mr. Putin is hardly a world leader. He is an antagonist that is basically destroying the world, bringing down to his level, which is basically no where. He has nothing to lose, really, except power, and the Russians swoon along with him. We have the same types here that really do not understand the meaning of interdependency and common decency, even in the form of manners. Mr. Putin is a bore in the true sense of the word, and Mr. Obama is a timid aspen leaf, trembling in the breeze. This is our world today. Surely there must be some one with a brain other than the Pope.","When Mr. Putin does something that has at least the appearence of being constructive, then and only then should we consider some kind of talk with him. Right now, Putin is pushing a human wave of refugees in to Europe as a result of their ever increasing defense of Assad. Russia should be left to defend against ISIS on their own, until they have altered their position in the Ukraine, and have acknowledge a willingness for Assad to step down from power.","Mr. Obama has a reputation as a weak negotiator and it's deserved. If you look at his success with the Republican Party, it is abyssmall. As for his dent in international relations, they're rather paltry, unless you consider than when he is accomanied by other countries, he does better. As for Syria, Mr. Obama should not touch the situtation with a 10 foot poll. He will only come up looking like a loser, since Mr. Putin, no doubt has this part of the chess match figured out. It is just better not to play the game. Let Mr. Putin sit there with his buddy, Mr. Assad. Let them exhaust themselves against ISIS. When Mr. Putin decides to let Assad go, and to adjust their role in the Ukraine, then maybe we can talk. Until then it's asta la vista, baby!","What we have here is a little, insecure man, who will do anything to become another Alexander the Great. The world is filled with delusion people, not all grandiose, but he is the most active among them. It is just another parting of the sea, where the delusional thrust on, in to what they believe to be the promise land, only to find that they are more isolated than ever. There are many interesting lessons here, but the one that seems most ironic is the criticism of Obama. Even if he had no clue, which was probably the best moment Bush the Younger ever had, he at least stood fast and let the game evolve. The World, rather than Obama has far more at stake than Obama. He's getting out. The rest of us have to live there. He didn't do us any favors, but, at lest, he did not send our young folk off to another war (yet). The world we live in is not about any one person, political party or dogma, it is about manners, and we can all see that Mr. Putin is not the most gracious among us. However, it is always what to do about it, and the European Union, right now, is coming up kind of weak. In an economic warfare world, it needs to step up now. I'm putting my foot down right now. If Ms. Merkel does not offer up some resistance, then off with the wurst. Never again, will I buy a wurst of any kind. I love wurst, but I love freedom more.","A picture is worth a thousand words, and Putin, unable to look in to the eyes of the Chocolate Guy, says it all. Putin is something less than human and the people in his country are worse. I am trying to be kind and not take sides. Everything coming out of Russia on the front seems to be a lie, though, and it makes you wonder just how stupid Russia thinks the rest of the world is? Greed is a great blinder, but eventually Europe will wake up. If America lays down the sword, it will have to do it sooner rather than later.","How the world allows Mr. Putin to play hide and seek like a little child and not reign him in now, says everything about a world that is neither united on any front, nor understanding the threat to world peace. We have begun an economic war, the results of which have been as little as the actions by the West have been timid. When lying, mendacity of another kind, becomes the staple of the day, and we do not stand up and say we do not believe you, then we are complicit in everything Putin does.","Ms. Merkel and Germany need to step out of the shadows back on to the world stage in a more meaningful and proactive way. They could make a difference. They are a huge country, very productive, almost to their own detriment, since that has seemed to have been a bone of contention to its neighbors in the last few years or more, as Germany maintained and others succumbed to the world downturn in the global economy...We can all realize, that people do not want to disturb productive relationships, and always should take the time and have the patience to understand their neighbor, but Mr. Putin has become, more or less, an open book to the world, as a result of his most recent shenanigans, and it is rapidly evolving in to a nightmare of land grabbing and an example to all of its neighbors of what it is to come, if allowed to continue. That includes Germany. There are standards that need to be observed in the world to be considered a positive and contributing participating member. As a country, the USA has many faults, but whatever they may be, these do not exceed in any way the insertion of disguised masked men in to another sovereign country. There is history in that area, everyone understands and respects it but that does not excuse, in any way, wanton aggression.","Mr. Putin has stirred up a hornet's nest and a lot of innocent people have been killed. He is responsible for this because it stems from his irresponsible actions to date. The rest of the world, though, will bare more responsibility, if they do nothing or continue with the luke warm response they have show thus far to every incursion. To listen to Mr. Putin explain away the incident makes one sick to their stomach. He has no regard for human existence and is the closest thing to an animal in human clothing that we have seen in a long time. Europe, in particular, needs to wake up.","Gee! I am no one, but I want to express my belief that the Ukrainian people are not toy soldiers or foils for some one else's machinations. They are people, just like you and me, with children and families, hopes and dreams. Because a great power once bestowed a grant on them, they should not have to suffer today because that power wants it back. With that said, it is equally obvious that Russia is now embarked upon a crusade to recover it's old glory, long gone, as a nation and as a world power, but as a people, if they allow their own government to violate their neighbors at will, they will eventually reap what they sow. Mr. Putin does not care about anyone other than a few people and himself. Russia is simply an oligarchy that has already squandered much of the nation's wealth to fill its own pockets. This is not just a Russian problem. It is a world problem, but we see in Russia's behavior today some of its ramifications, today, namely, the armed invasion of another country, which could be some other country on their border tomorrow. Unfortunately, we already see acquiescence in the European Union, lest their economies suffer. No one wants to sacrifice anything. Every one is out for themselves. The Free Market of integrity and morals run over by Russian tanks, today, American tanks, yesterday, and Israeli tanks, the day before. To this there seems to be no end. Unless the people of the world put their foot down and demand no more, rather than be willing participants.","Mr. McCain's political party doesn't even support human rights in our own country, so he is, once again, talking out of both sides of his mouth, in addition to horrible-izing and exaggerating the threat for the sole purpose of puffing up himself and deflating any potential gain in stature by President Obama. Making Mr. Putin out to be a bigger threat than in actuality is the knee jerk reaction of the neocons, when it smells money. Mr. Obama appears to have moved beyond this and has a much more mature and reasoned concept of reality to deal with the multi-dimensional and complex realities of a developing world in the 21st Century. Is it good enough? I don't think so, but it's better. We do not need to retreat in to the same old bluster and fantasies of the neocons, like Mr. McCain is proposing...He fails to make an argument for why the USA looks weak in this situation, unless he is mistaking a reasoned, realistic, and rational position for weakness, as I think he is. None of the things he recommends in any way are different than what we are already doing. As for the rest, it is all conjecture and very poor conjecture at that. If the world was only as simple as Mr. McCain believes it is, but then, if it was, we would still be in the 19th Century...I do not see the loss of Crimea as a great loss to the Ukraine, for in reality it looks very much like a trapped animal that needs to bite off its foot to gain freedom. For us, Mr. McCain is our foot."

Alexander,,,,"Let's just keep a few salient points in mind:..1.  Russia is trying to dictate Ukraine's future by military invasion - leading to thousands of deaths, destruction of billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and even annexation - in Europe in the 21st century!..2.  The appeasement crowd thought Putin would stop at Crimea.  He didn't...3.  Putin has made the following threats: Russia ill Not Allow Other Countries To Gain 'Military Superiority' Over Russia;  I want to remind you that Russia is one of the leading nuclear powers; and that NATO threatens its (russia's) very existence...Whoa... let's look at that last one again - how, precisely, does NATO threaten russia?  What do russians fear from NATO?  NATO doesn't - and cannot, due to its very nature - annex any nation.  NATO cannot start any wars.  What do Putin and his russian supporters fear?..No one has been able to answer that last bit.

Jiminy,,,,"This cease fire was doomed from the start.  Why did the EU delay the cease fire by two days?  So Putin and his Russian backed terrorists could kill and devastate the lives of more Ukrainians?  So they could seize more territory for his frozen conflict?  Did the EU think that suddenly Putin was going to stop lying and suddenly behave like a human being instead of craven sociopath he clearly is?  Since before Socchi Putin has consistently lied in his public statements to the West on his intentions and actions in Ukraine and strangely the EU keeps taking his lies at face value.  Why???  Putin and his supporters are responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians in Ukraine.  They are responsible for the shooting down of the civilian aircraft and the death of hundreds of EU citizens.  They have behaved like criminals and violated international law since the beginning of this invasion;  Russia invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine.   Appeasement didn't work out well for Neville Chamberlain, it will not work out well here.   I do not advocate war, but it is already there.   A lie must be called a lie, sanctions must have teeth and Ukraine must be supported and allowed to defend itself from this monstrous aggression.","I am not a hawk, but the NY Times got it wrong on this along with the EU appeasers. Ukraine needs to be able to defend itself from the monsterous aggression inflicted on it by Putins and his lackeys.  Putin will continue his feint and attack as long as the US ans EU allow.  He believes in his twisted little mind that he has a right to Ukraine and has no qualms about murdering and displacing Ukrainians to prove his point.  Ukraine should be supported, including with defensive weapons to shake off this beast.  Putin and his mafia government  should be made to feel as much pain as possible, that is s all they understand.","Actually, if you have been following closely what is going on in Ukraine, you would know that what Friedman is writing is spot on.  NATO has never threatened Russia with invasion.  That is a paranoid propaganda tool used by Putin to gain personal power.  NATO is a defensive coalition, to deter Russian aggression against it's neighbors.  Putin's actions in Ukraine, Georgia and Estonia have all been aggressive.  He is a thug.  The threat of Russian aggression is the only reason Russia's neighbors clamber  to join NATO.","You have a few of your facts wrong.  The Ukrainian government was not actually overthrown.  Yanukovich abdicated his leadership and fled Ukraine after he oversaw mass killings of peaceful protestors in Maidan Square.  The parliament immediately instated an interim president until elections could be held.  Poreshenko was elected by a significant majority..Putin invaded Ukraine as revenge for Ukraine's refusal to join his RussianAsian economic block.  He has been fomenting violence in Eastern Ukraine since he first invaded Crimea last Spring.  ..We did not back Putin into a corner.  Putin backed himself into a corner.  Putin invaded a sovereign nation.  Crimea was not his to take.  The West has bent over backwards to work with Russa and to bring Russia into the present.  Putin prefers Soviet Russia or perhaps Czarist Russia.  He is a despot overseeing a kleptocratic government, controlling a generationally scarred populace with propaganda.  And about name calling;      The Russian propaganda press has been labeling all Ukrainians Fascists and Nazis for months.  This is dangerous and destructive and grossly false propaganda drummed into the Russian population.  It has the effect of dehumanizing an entire country (Ukraine), making it easier for Putin to justify killing Ukrainians in his undeclared war against Ukraine.   I do not understand Putin apologists.  He really is a troll in the true and awful sense of the word.","I do not support the use of cluster bombs by anyone, but you conveniently forget to mention that the article you referred also said that the rebels (i.e. terrorists) also used cluster bombs.  You also forgot to mention that many of those dead were Ukrainian soldiers.  You are correct there was no violence in Ukraine for 23 years, but you are incorrect in siting the Ukrainian military as the cause.  The invasion of Crimea and the subsequent not so covert invasion of Eastern Ukraine by Russia has been the driving force of the violence in Eastern Ukraine.     The separatists (terrorists) who control parts of Eastern Ukraine were never representative of the majority of Ukrainians even in Eastern Ukraine.  If not for Putin's aggressive meddling there would be no war in Ukraine.","Well justified?  There is no justification for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and it's continued terrorist support killing thousands of Ukrainian civilians under the false guise of protecting ethnic Russians that never needed protection before Putin invaded and don't need it even now.  You can try and sell your false justification of Russian aggression but it does not change the facts: That there was and is no justification for the  murderous and criminal behavior of the Kremlin mafia.",You are distorting the facts about who the agressors are inthis war.  It is no the Ukrainians.  Putin invaded Ukraine.  Putin and his Russian operatives started the war in eastern Ukraine and continue to be the main instigators of the violence in Eastern Ukraine.  You have completely misrepresented what the vast majority of Ukrainians want which is peace and the end of Russian aggression against their country.,"I would hardly call your view unbiased.  It is also not factual.  Maidan was a peaceful protest  against a corrupt goverment.  It was a homegrown uprising of civil society.  Svaboda and the far right played a very minor role then and and even lesser role in government of Ukraine today.   Yanukovich presided over the mass murder of over 100 peaceful protesters in Maidan.  After Yanukovich fled, Kyiv returned to the peaceful civil society immediately.  The parliament which was still in place (and did not flee) appointed an interim president and  scheduled early elections.  Putin invaded Crimea, and imported and continues to preside over the violence in Donetsk.  The vote in Crimea was not legitimate, if you actually followed the news and thought critically, you would know this.  Russia invaded Crimea.",We didn't make Putin an international pariah.  He did that very well on his own.,"Perhaps you prefer Russia propaganda?  There is plenty of evidence available in the news and on the Internet confirming the invasion of Eastern Ukraine by Russia. There is also ample evidence of thousands of Russian troops still in Ukraine.  Putin since he denies the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine, will now entrench them in Eastern Ukraine, where he can activate them when Ukraine doesn't  acquiesce to his most recent imperialist whim.    He has also made no move to remove the Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border.  NATO and the EU leaders have generally been acting in denial of Putin's covert but very real invasion of Ukraine.  Even now they give themselves a back door escape on enforcing sanctions on Russia.  Greed corruption and cowardice sieze the day, Putin wins"
Patrick,,,,"The only language Russians and Putin understand is the show of force and the willingness to use it. There is no other way to deal with Russia unless there is a change in their government which is unlikely..The United States should keep a quick reaction force of a Division size permanently stationed in Poland roughly 4 Battalions or 3000 men. This Force should be able to act together with the NATO reaction force that is on the works..I do not think this money is wasted and I do not think its better spent in schools or health care. The money spend in the military is money that safe guards the continuity of the United States and of western civilization. I am not sure why people have a hard time understanding that. If there is no safety or western civility and economic progress in your life what does it matter how much money you want to put in schools or healthcare?.Regarding military service as someone brought it up...Israel has a 2-3 year mandatory military service for EVERYONE. Because everyone needs to contribute for the success of society as a whole. We need a military draft, a voluntary army is not enough.

Putin certainly is old K.G.B. military.",Putin continues to play the West like a fiddle. Either get serious with the sanctions and cut off Russia from everything like in the Soviet days or give the Ukrainians the weaponry necessary to defend themselves from invasion.

Targeted sanctions against individual peoplecompanies were a good start but clearly are no longer sufficient.,":It was only ceded to Ukraine in the 1950s........and the modern state of Israel was created in 1947. If we start talking about who had what when, all the world borders would be in flux. ..Your points about the economic interdependence between Russia and western Europe are much more important points; points Putin seems to be undervaluing.","And by turning off the oil, Putin would lose the revenue he needs to stay popular.",Any confirmed transfer of arms to civilians or non-uniformed soldiers from Russian stores should be treated as a violation of the United Nations charter...Putin has already violated the UN Charter. The post invasion approval by the.Russian Parliament reminds me of the approval given the Japanese radical army after the Rape of Nanking in WWII. Putin may be sincere about his feelings towards the Ukraine but that doesn't make him right. I don't know how this will play out but Putin is obviously trying to fix it with bullying tactics. How do you deal with a bully?,"Why should you be able to tell Ukraine how to conduct its business. We had a Civil War to stop the South from breaking off. Why shouldn't Ukraine be free to enter agreements with other entities; NATO included. I haven't even heard that they want to join NATO but if they did, that should be their choice, not Putin's. Yes, ethnicities needs should be addressed but that doesn't mean that they should be able to secede. If secession were the answer, what about Chechnya? While were at it, what about Chechnya rights? Where is their round table?..Nobody wants to invade Russia. Putin is the only one to put guns into action.","If we start arguing about traditional borders, probably every nation on the planet would be reconfigured. And which tradition would we follow? Perhaps the Hapsburg or the Ottoman Empire maps? Or should we go back further to the Greek or Roman Empires?..Crimea is partly so Russian because of the purge of the Crimean Tartars in the days of Stalin as well as the positioning of the Russian navy there. ..Putin got his feelings hurt when Ukraine decided that the corrupt weak government he was propping up failed and the people (especially in the west) wanted to go European and hopefully relieve themselves from the poverty they've been enduring for decades...Putin's ego has cost lives and his brazen actions have taken attention from his troubled economy, which is way too dependent on oil revenue. ..Just as many in the US realize that we can't have it our way all the time, Putin needs to wake up to the fact that the Russian Empire is no more. He needs to make alliances rather than dictate terms if he really wants a lasting legacy to be proud of.","Yanukovych pulled out pulled out when Putin told him to. Whether that was because of a threat (gas prices) or reward (a new loan) is a matter of interpretation and we might never know which one (or both) swayed him. Yanukovych did flee to Russia, leaving behind the very expensive mansion he was building while ordinary citizens were suffering.  ..Why would a loan from the Eurozone be bad for all Ukraine? It would seem that expanded trade would increase employment in a depressed economy."
toom,,,,"The problem is that Putin aims to Russia to the status of pre-1989, cost what it will. He act as though he agrees with the west and EU, and then hit the reset button when the oil price rises, as it must. To paraphrase Lenin: I want to make sure Putin &amp; co. never deviate from any guarantees they agree to.","Russia is an economic ruin because Putin &amp; co take over every enterprise that seems to have an value. So they have themselves to blame for Russian weakness in regard to sanctions. As to Russian claims to Crimea, this is not very logical since the Ottomans had it for many centuries, until about 150 years ago. To me, Russian leaders need to think about life and the economy in the 21st century. Getting rid of the Putin group would be the first move in this direction.",Wait until the need for spare parts for the western equipment in Russia arises. Then we shall find out who Putin's friends in the west are. They will argue that this may be a cold winter in western Europe and that the Europeans must come to terms with Putin &amp; co.,"Putin would do better if he threatened to reduce the oil and natural gas exports to nearby states if they resisted his aims. In other words, if Germany, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and others were more friendly to Russia, they would be treated nicely. He does not seem to have undertaken this strategy. ..In regard to Syria, it is too late. Assad has failed. His demise is only a matter of time.","The Germans want a peaceful existence after the 90 years of tension. Also their supply of natural gas depends on the good intentions of Putin &amp; co. Whether the good intentions last much longer is not clear. As to the Crimea, it was longer under the Ottomans. So the right of Russia to the Crimea is questionable. ..Lots of critics of Putin meet violent deaths. Do not forget that.",,,,,

If the United States had used his techniques to seize Quebec or to take over Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas provinces of Mexico, we'd be (rightly) hauled up for world condemnation!","Perhaps precisely because Putin must be aware that any Russian military drive into southeastern Ukraine would entail bloody resistance, serious trade sanctions, enormous costs and, if it led to annexation, a truncated but virulently anti-Russia and pro-West Ukraine, this may be the way out.  What's wrong with a Russia suffering serious trade restrictions, fighting another internal war (probably similar to that Stalin was stuck with in the Ukraine during 1945 - 1953), and creating a virulently anti-Russian and pro-West (albeit truncated) Ukraine?  On top of that Putin would be stuck with the obsolete industrial dinosaur of Eastern Ukraine.  A population of folks who thought that annexation would lead them to heaven and discovered that they're now third-rate citizens in a fourth-rate nation wouldn't be a bad outcome either.  It might keep Putin occupied with internal discord and less inclined to move on the Baltic Republics, Kazakhstan, and so on.  Czarist imperialist dreams fell apart in 1905 when arrogance led to Czar Nicolas II's humiliation at the hands of the Japanese.

Unless Putin decides to send in tanks this will stand as a pivotal point.  (Considering how successful sending tanks into Hungary in 1958 and into Czechoslovakia in 1968 even if Putin does send his military into Ukraine, the long-term prospects for Russian imperialism are dim.)

Alan MacDonald,,,,"Absolutely the most useful thing that Putin could say and do in sobering-up Obama to his responsibility for igniting global conflict would be to reprise what Lloyd Bentsen lectured Dan Quayle on in the '88 campaign:..Mister Obama, I knew Empire, I saw the damage that dreams of Global Empire caused my country, and you sir are allowing a Disguised Global Crony-Capitalist Empire to run rough-shod over your country...Mr. Obama, I knew Empire, I had to pick-up the pieces of Empire after my country collapsed, and 'your country is no country', sir --- but merely acting like a well disguised and dangerous global Empire --- and you better wake-up and do something to save your country from Empire first, and then together we can agree to pull back from this lunacy of Empire war preparation, as your Kennedy and our Khrushchev did by acting as men of good faith against the pressures toward global Empire in '62...If Obama doesn't have the courage to face the fact that our country is acting like an Empire, hopefully Bernie andor Jim Webb will.","I had always understood the disproportionate casualties suffered by Russia in winning the Second World War (of Empires) and 'excising' the cancer of fascism as the disease of Empires, but by doing a bit of research (and serious thinking after seeing RT TV's commentary about 'Victory Day' over fascismNazism) I am even more impressed with Russia's and the Russian peoples' insightful turn away from Empire in the 1989-1991 period of history ---- a turn away from Empire, BTW, which Americans have yet to take in this supposedly 'exceptional' country, which is actually the HQ of the last Empire on earth, the 'exceptionally well hidden' Disguised Global Empire (DGE)...These numbers reveal some of the truth of history about the human costs borne in the Second World War (of Empires):..<a hrefhttp:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWorldWarIIcasualtiesHumanlossesbycountry titlehttp:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWorldWarIIcasualtiesHumanlossesbycountry targetblank>http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWorldWarIIcasualtiesHumanlossesbycou...<a> ..Yes, it can easily be seen that the US was an 'exceptional' country in the Second World War of Empires...The most critical and useful advice that Putin (or any of the current leaders of the other Empires that fought 74 years ago in the Second World War of Empires) could give the American people based on real history is to Turn away from EMPIRE (of either the seen or disguised variety) before it is too late",,,,,,,,

bobw,,,,"Russians has always seen themselves , rightly or wrongly, as the standard bearers of a distinct civilization. And given Russia's history of repeated invasions they have a right to be a little paranoid. Also, Russia will never be a normal country, in that it will never  happily accept being treated as less than a Great Power, at a level with the U.S or China. Given the size of its population or economy, maybe its Great Power days are over, but Putin doesn't think so.","President Vladimir Putin of Russia is trying to have it both ways in Syria. He is dangerously building up Russias military presence there, while positioning himself as the worlds savior against Islamic extremists and holding high-level military-to-military talks with the United States. ..Actually, how is that trying to have  it both ways. Putin is building up Russia's military presence to destroy ISIS. Makes sense to me. We should give him a hand.","This is not a civil war, nor is it a fascist coup. Eastern Ukrainians are not rising up against an oppressive regime in Kiev...Yes the Russians invaded Ukraine (with at most 2000 troops) in further support of Eastern Ukrainian separatists and pushed back the Ukrainian army. And Putin is lying about it. Although he knows we know he's lying, and we know he knows, so.....But that doesn't mean that the author's quoted comment is true. The Eastern Ukrainians did rise up against a Kiev regime initially established through violence (fact) with significant fascist elements (Right Sector), that was initially oppressive (elimination of Russian language rights). The separatists have significant public support (exactly how much is difficult to establish) which has likely grown since their own government started shelling them. And local people has done most of the fighting (therefore civil war). ..So the fact of significant Russian involvement doesn't mean that any element of the quoted statement is true...And maybe Obama used the word incursion because, well, 2000 troops and all.....When Americans invade (rightly or wrongly) they tend to go big ( 100,000 plus) or go home.","The Russians acquiesced to NATO membership for their former Eastern European satellites and the Baltics because they had limited options and those nations weren't part of what they consider the Slavic heartland. The Ukraine, and particularly Eastern Ukraine, is. ..The Russians still have limited options. They aren't crazy enough to think that they are economically or militarily a match for NATO. They would never dream of invading a NATO nation. But they may invade the Ukraine. This is because the Ukraine is far more important to them (the people, not just the Putin regime) than it is to the EU or the States. Knowing that there will be no military response, they may be willing to tolerate the long term economic and political pain...Its time to realize that the Russians will simply not accept a Russophobic Ukrainian  government or NATO membership for the country, at least for the foreseeable future. Finlandization is the only option for a united Ukraine. It didn't work out badly for Finland, after all, and the old Soviets had far more reason to deal harshly with the Finns than the Russians do with their Ukrainian little cousins.","Actually, Oh, I'm pretty educated, and its Svoboda and Right sector  that I'm worried about, not Putin",,,,,
Kurt,,,,"As much as Putin's actions have been unjustifiable, he is not entirely wrong when he blames US actions for bringing this on. Moving NATO and the EU eastward may have seemed natural to us following the fall of the Soviet Union, but to a Russian nationalist, such might appear threatening. Which would have been bearable, I suppose, until the Ukraine unrest...Now Putin has no right to impose conditions on Ukraine, but the talk at the time the pro-Russian government was outsted was of accession to NATO and the EU. Any Russian would have seen that as a threat, as would we have, had the situation been reversed...Again, such is still no excuse for Putin's militarily annexing territory of a sovereign state. But we also should have been aware of his limits and respected them as well. Ukraine is of far more use to us as a buffer state than as another member of the West, at least until such time as we can get Russia to drop its suspicions and join as well...Russia sees itself as a wounded great power, one whose interests are being ignored and blocked,, and such is a very dangerous situation. Stripped of ethical considerations, we ignore such attitude at our own peril. We cannot allow Russia to advance in the manner it has been, but nor is it in our interests to bait the bear...Unfortunately, probably the best we can now hope for is that nothing irrevocable happens until Putin leaves the scene, leaving a (hopefully) more tractable successor.","The Baathist regime in Syria has been a Russian and Iranian client for decades. So, although it might be preferable were a different setup in place, were such to continue it would not be a dire threat to our security. And any rebel force likely to take power in Syria would be even more hateful to us than Assad. Furthermore, an enhanced Russian presence in Syria might restrain iran's growing influence in the area...Offer to support Russia's efforts in return for them getting Assad to step down gracefully. The Russian client Baathist regime can stay, so their interests are protected. Assad steps down into comfortable and safe retirement, thereby removing him from the scene. And maybe violence ends...Our problems with Russia have come from the possible eastward expansion of NATO and the EU into Ukraine and Georgia, something which Putin sees as existential threat to himself but benefits us little. So isn't it time to see if we can mend fences? Secure both Ukraine and Georgia by undertaking that no Soviet breakaway republics shall be added to the West without the accession of Russia at the same time in return for Putin agreeing to cease his aggression against them. Then move to find ways in which we can cooperate...Both the Russians and the West face problems of Islamic radicalism. ISIS threatens us all. So why should we seek to make it difficult for Russia to do what we refuse to do ourselves? Make a deal, make peace, find common ground, move on.","We are blundering our way into catastrophe. None of this would have happened had we, when the Ukrainian unrest first began, assured Putin that Ukraine would not be admitted to the EU or to NATO.  Moral issues aside, those have always been red lines for Putin and many other Russians, and by encouraging Ukraine to believe such was possible, we presented Putin with an issue on which he was prepared to fight...I do not doubt that admission into the West would be beneficial to Ukraine and morally Russia has no business dictating to Ukraine as to its internal politics or economic future. But it is ironic that we continue to hold out the possiblity of such a future to Ukraine, under which we would be obligated to come to its defense if attacked, and thereby provoking Putin to attack in in actuality, when we are not now willing to come to its defense anyway...Putin is attacking Ukraine because he thinks we will bring it into NATO, but we are not willing to defend it anyway. Which seems to me to present us with the choice of whether to appease Putin and throw Ukraine to the wolves or to come to its defense. And if we are not willing to defend it, in actuality we would not be bringing it into NATO and the EU anyway, so our only option would be to help them make the best deal they can (ie appease Putin)...A signal lesson in the foolishness of cheerleading those foreign developments we are not willing to fight to defend.","I think it is an over simplification to state that Putin is intervening in Ukraine because he fears successful democratization would threaten his kleptocratic regime. Yes, there is an element of that, but primarily his motivation is his wish to reconstitute the influence of the Russosphere under his leadership...Putin has gone on record calling the breakup of the Soviet Union the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th Century, and there is no reason to doubt his sincerity in believing that. Regardless of what we see as the moral issues, any Russian patriot would bemoan the loss of its superpower status and diminution of its influence...In order for Russia to reattain its previous level of power would require its reabsorption of much of the breakaway republics back into the Russian orbit in some kind of politicaleconomic bloc under Russian leadership, and Ukraine is the most important of those states. Were Ukraine to move westward without Russia, such would permanently condemn Russia to the status of middling regional power, a situation Putin devoutly despises...All the more because many Russians, as would Americans were the situation reversed, see NATO's eastward expansion as a threat to their nation, especially as such would cut Russia off from the Black Sea. Which is why Putin's first priority was to detach Crimea from Ukraine and why rebels are working to seize overland communications to it...Morality aside, this is power politics and we cannot ignore that.","If we are concerned about providing Putin with an off ramp to escape this situation, the time to have worried about this was when the Ukrainian unrest first came up. Its national ego bruised by the breakup of empire, did we really think that Russia would welcome further expansion of the EU and NATO eastwards? Instead, we all sat by and cheered while warning Russia not to take any action, while we did nothing to deter such action. Did we really think that Putin would be deterred because we view his actions as illegitimate and wrong?..Putin wanted Ukraine for his Eurasian Union. He couldn't get it, and he probably would have been willing to settle for a no decision. Instead, when presented with the alternative of having the EUNATO conglomerate move hundreds of miles eastward, cutting Russia off from the Black Sea, he responded as any nation would have to what he perceived as a threat...Regardless of what we believe to be morally right and proper, the world doesn't work like that. And unless we are prepared to fight for it (and, in this case such would be an over reaction), we have to be more circumspect in advancing our interests at the expense of what others consider to be theirs.","The choices faced by Putin were either for Russia to seek to integrate into the West, where it would be a middling power subjected to Western expectations of political and social norms, or he could seek to regain Russia's superpower status through reintegration of the Soviet Union's breakaway republics back into some unit under Russian domination. He has obviously chosen the latter...His main opportunity for this lies in the disunity of the West. During the Cold War, the ideological lines were pretty clear, and after the first decade of that conflict, while the Soviets were able to stir dissent helped by the usual useful idiots, there was no real chance of major Western defections from NATO. Now however, Russia is making inroads in Cyprus, and Greece and a variety of parties in Western states have accepted him as their paymaster. Hungary makes approving noises towards him as does a good part of Germany...The temptation for him is that if he could fragment NATO it would change his strategic situation overnight. Russia vs NATO will prove a loser, but Russia vs a weak and disunited collection of smaller states would make it the pre-eminent power in Europe. The problem being that the measure with perhaps the best chance of shattering NATO is also the most risky, attempting to seize territory belonging to NATO states in the hope that NATO would not respond effectively, thereby causing the alliance to disintegrate as its component states sought security elsewhere.","It is fatuous to believe that this cease fire is any more likely to be lasting than the others. That's because the underlying issue has not been resolved. Russia will not tolerate Ukraine integrating with the West and is willing to fight to prevent that. All this nonsense about the rights of ethnic Great Russians is, at best a cover story for the fundamental problem. It is not coincidence that the most recent cease fire broke down shortly after Ukraine renewed its rhetorical efforts to join the EU...With respect to Ms Merkel and Mr Hollande, they still see that as a possibility. But as soon as another effort is made to do so, you will see a sudden renewed outburst of violence that will result in even more dire circumstances for Ukraine. Russia has no intention of allowing it to escape Moscow's orbit...The entire intent of the aggression is first, to secure Russia's access to the Black Sea. Then it is intended to create such issues in Ukraine that no one in the EU would be willing to take it in, while the rebel areas and the federalization deal is intended to cripple Ukraine politically and economically..And if Ukraine does move westward, Russia's intent is to calve off as much of it as possible. ..Regardless of any agreement, Putin will continue to destabilize Ukraine. Putin's sincerity in this situation is exactly the same as that of Adolph Hitler after Munich in 1936, and the end result will likely be the same.","What is driving the conflict is Russia's fear that Ukraine will integrate with the West, thereby consigning it permanently to the status of middling regional power, while also moving NATO's strategic frontier hundreds of miles eastward and cutting Russia off from the Black Sea.  Ukraine's successful integration into the West would require a commitment from the NATO powers to defend it if attacked. Since no NATO country is willing to do that now, it should be apparent that Ukraine will not integrate into the West against Russia's will anyway. Russia is willing to fight to prevent that, and while we may feel Ukraine has the absolute right to do so, we are not willing to fight to give it that opportunity. So who do you think is likely to come out on top here?..Frankly, Ukraine is more useful to us as a non-aligned buffer state than as a full fledged member of the West anyway...What we should do is offer Putin a deal. Should he cease his aggression (for real, not just faking it like he has been and lying about it), we will guarantee that Ukraine will not be admitted to NATO or the EU. Should he continue his aggression, we will arm Ukraine. Should that trigger heightened Russian aggression or invasion, just as Putin is willing to fight to stop Ukraine from moving westward, we will fight to preserve its neutral status. But that, should he force us into that situation, we would not guarantee not to accept it into the alliance...But barring such conversation, we should not escalate.","In order to bring an end to the Ukrainian conflict, we first need to understand what it is the other side is trying to do. Should we respond to it as if its intervention is designed to protect the interests of ethnic Russians in Ukraine or if we think we can reason with Putin, we are wasting our time...Russia is attacking Ukraine because of its moves to join NATO and the EU, which would both deny Russia the opportunity of eventually reabsorbing it into its strategic and economic orbit (and increasing its national power thereby) while moving that which it sees as an existential threat to it eastward. Russia will not tolerate such a development and is willing to fight to prevent that. We look at such a thing as welcome and normal but are not willing to fight to allow it. Who is likely to prevail?..The only way the fighting ends is if NATO intervenes decisively or if we give the Russians what they want. It is no coincidence that the latest round of invasion has taken place following Ukraine's amending its law regarding foreign alliances with the West. That is what is driving the conflict, and even were we to arm the Ukrainians and their forces could use those arms effectively, they cannot win this on their own...Part of being in NATO is being willing to defend each other in need. If we are not willing to defend Ukraine now, in reality it will not be allowed in. So why hold out hope for them while provoking Putin as well? A Finlandization of Ukraine best protects that country now","The substance of Putin's plan? Nice country ya got there. Wanna keep it?..Basically, no Russian government would have allowed Ukraine to permanently detach itself from Russia. And the entire situation could have been avoided had NATO and the EU made it clear when the Ukrainian unrest first began that neither country would be admitted to the Western alignments without the other...That being said, Putin's disdain for international norms he obviously sees as not serving his interests is pretty clear, as is his hypocrisy. Basically, his policy is that he will make Ukraine a living hell unless and until it capitulates and agrees to neuter itself and render itself infinitely vulnerable to Russian pressure...Strangely, the Russian military is heavily dependent upon Ukraine for a wide variety of weaponry, the factories for which had been located in Ukraine during Soviet times. Is anybody aware of where those factories happen to be located relative to the areas Russia is basically trying to calve off from Ukraine?"

You would think we would have learned that by now...There are those who say we can't stop the Russians in Ukraine by supplying weapons.  I guess the Russians just decided to leave Afghanistan on their own...There are those who say oil prices will take care of the problem.  Russian oil prices are in dollars and the ruble has dropped in half.  Russian is still getting the same number of rubles!  Sure there will be inflation and more domestic products.  So what?..There are those who say sanctions will work.  What do we buy from and export to Russia?  How much oil can Europe survive without? ..Where are the answers and a real solution from our leaders?  We should arm Ukraine immediately.,Obama was outfoxed by Putin again!   What a Commander in Chief.,"Putin has proven over and over that he can't be trusted, but there go Western leaders trusting him again. Putin is a liar. He's always been one. Why do we treat him like someone with moral fiber. He's an amoral bain on the civilized world.",Putin did it in Ukraine and is doing it again in Syria.  ..we have failed not once but multiple times in the Middle East.  We will continue to fail as long as our opponents believe we will do nothing and our allies believe they can not count on us...Remember when Khomeini and a bunch of college students brought a US president to his knees and cost him reelection?..This is not recoverable.  We will continue to fail under our current leadership.,Putin may have played his big oilenergy grab..But who needs him?.The US has fracking; Australia has huge gas and thoriumuranium reserves..Relax
Georg Witke,,,,"The biggest impact on oil prices in the long term will be whether the US and the world change the energy policies and stop burning the fossil fuel, aka oil, whenever possible. While the analysis of Putin is not off the mark, the analysis of the fossil fuel economic politics is.","It seems to me that the current regime in Kiev is doing everything it can to in fact cut of the eastern and souther region and hand it over to Russia. They speak of their own population with open disdain, have sent army at them and killed them. They do not really seem to want it. They cannot afford to subsidize it. And Putin does not really want them either. He wants Ukraine to subsidize the insolvent mining industry, why would he want that in his country. This all seems to be a game of smoke and mirrors.","The problem with the current situation in Ukraine is that the pro-western government does rely on the unreformed pro-fascist groups. Ukraine, as your article rightly points out, fought on both sides. Not the entire Ukrainian government consists of such groups, but they have quite a number of them in the current government. They form the para-military arm of the current regime, implicated in burning people alive in Odessa. So Putin and his government are correct to state and Russians living in Ukraine have the right to refuse that  kind of government, imposed by a coup. That does not make Putin any better of course and his base is heavily nationalistic (Russia did, however, give some 20 million lives in WW2 and basically broke the back of European fascism). But it is a conundrum, since we do support the pro-western regime. Basically, one fascism pitted against another nationalism.",,,,,,,
ed g,,,,"Putin just called me and expressed disappointment. Sadly, he said he will position some nuclear weapons at the countries harboring Russia's enemy's stockpile. He said he was having toruble keeping his Russian friends lined up with him as they are all capitalists and just want to make money with their worldwide 1 friends. Now they are like Americans being bulldozed into war and nationalism. Remember Uncle 'Joe had all of Russia behind him even after he was that country's most despised leader (and a commie too)...As for the Riga roads, a few logins over those roads by tanks and they will look like any road in America. All that machismo by Obama means the military and secret government have rerun Kennedy getting whacked in Dallas. Obama will need corporate board spots to continue to live like a.1-er. And more importantly, it sets up Hilairy as the next warrior president. She has always supported the military and now she can pick and choose the war she wants to have your sons, daughters, spouses and granchildren fight. You can bet Chelsea will not be joing to fight, be in harm's way or anything else that would disrupt her 'Golden' spoon in mouth life...It is not our war; never was. We agreed to many things but rarely kept our word.

It claimed states' rights to do so, before and since the Civil War. It is interesting to see the right wing align itself with the federalist line that a strong central government trumps states' rights in the Crimea...The Czarist Empire fell during the 1914-1921 era. It was a feudalistic, autocratic and 1 owned and run operation. The American Empire, allies and dictator friends beat down the Czarist successor, the USSR, after a 70 year struggle that included invasion of Russia, support for the renagade White Army, economic isolation efforts (economic sanctions without that fancy title) and proxy hot and cold wars...The old America guard and an integrated Europe see a power play by the Russians, one we can not stop, and one that could have been turned into a peaceful trade-off for Syria...So the Republics have an old tune to sing, 'soft on Russia'. No mention of Bush II's evaluation of Putin or the devastation to America caused by the Bush neo-cons who saw America as ruling the world; an America which could not be challenged. Their delusions have caused havoc. Obama, fearing the 'weak on Russia' echo, has reacted in all the wrong ways. ..The 1 in each country have more in common with the 1 elsewhere except when they play their version of Monopoly (which ironically does not include government).

But rough and tough Reagan knew what to do: invaded a country using (get this) the safety of medical school students from America sitting on the beach during their meditation...Ask Russia to give the West (including old enemies Poland, Germany, England and France) an exposed underbelly and you have a deal breaker...SOLUTION: Crimea becomes independent, neutral country and the same for the rest of the Ukraine. Neither one has its own standing armed forces. In exchange, Russia stops support for Syrian dictator and Syria becomes a neutral country with no standing army. Israel dismantles all settlements and Jerusalem is declared the home of the U.N. Jerusalem has no standing armed forces. The Palestinians and Israel define borders and each then declares neutrality and acceptance of the other and the whole region disarms...Add Switzerland and we start to get a few unarmed, neutral countries.

But for right now, don't make an bets...I am sorry history is a downer for you and many others whose sources include the likes of Rushed Limbaugh. I made a comparison of an earlier epoch of Russia's history to today's Ukraine mess. ..I failed to mention the aftermath of America's along with Britain and France's unmentioned enmity towards Russia since 1917 or so which was only overlooked as Stalin's Russians fought off his short lived newborn friendship with Hitler. A fight that turned the war against Hitler's Nazi invasion and made victory possible. And yes, America used Lend-Lease to help the Russians during that period. After WW I, America and its war allies did everything including an invasion of Russia to overturn a popular revolt against an unpopular Czar and feudal state. I am sure America would find it difficult to forget a Russian invasion of America if that had ever happened...But the main point and event is that Russia, Russians and Putin just as with America, Americans and Obama want to ensure the integrity and safety of their country. The Ukraine is the underbelly of Russia and offers security if within the Russian sphere of influence and a threat if under control or influence of NATO andor America. ..The 1 want what they want and have the power to get it; except when they prey on each other. The 1-ers will work something out because America is not ready for another war and Putin has no choice.","Before there was a the Crimea, there was Ukraine with a President favorable to Russia. He got ousted in a coup. Or did the Putin send in the hit men to oust someone favorable to him? Maybe I got the timeline wrong or a fact out of place.

Well, not exactly anything. They are willing to send your kids to fight and die to protect their way of life...So who is behind the Obama and Putin struggle? Of course their nationalist elements, security forces and (non) intelligent agencies. In this one case the usual suspects of religious nuts seem to be unopposed to the escalation but are not quite sure when to call for their holy war, ethnic and religious cleansing, crusade and inquisition in the Ukraine. And best of memory recall, not even the pope has spoken against the impending destruction...In America we see 1 internecine conflicts occasionally.

The issue is that the NATO countries surround Russia. Being that Russia lost 20 million people in WWII, I think it reasonable to assume they might be uncomfortable with a US led contingent of countries encroaching all around them...The US's defense system is viewed by Putin as another power play by the US and its allies. What would the US do if any neighboring countries developed an alliance under a communist or socialist flag? Right, the US would not only threaten, it would aggressively remove the perceived threat..The US does that even in the absence of real threats to our national security.

If West belief that Ukraine is strategic country and must be protected, then directly protect Ukraine. Otherwise let Putin do what is right for him and in the process destroy Russia. People of Ukrine should take this fight as their fight for democracy and solve it on their term, not what West thinks best for them. If that means the division of Ukrine- so be it. In no circumstances, UD should give arms to Ukrine - ISIS is getting all their arms to fight Iraq and Syria, why Ukrine can not get it. Only thing West can do is to give money to Ukrine to buy arms on black market.","Putin is far ahead of US strategic experts - he defends a National leader, where as America is trying to defend a Nablus concept of democracy without fully defining its structure and leaderships. In spite of Asad's brutality, he is a Syrian national leader and a section of society is willing to fight for his vision. ..The Syrian war looks very much like the Vietnam war - only difference is Russia is taking the role of America. Over time, America will take the role of China and fight against ISIS will become a mute point. A very interesting phase of world history slowly manifesting in front of us.","The stupid policy of supporting Nazis and jerks in Kiev, while sanctioning Russia and prompting a new Cold War in Europe is dangerous and illustrates just how desperate the PetroDollar Club is at trying to keep their fiat printing machine going.

If we do not challenge now, there will definitely be another European War...Unlike Sr. bush, Obama and EU leaders understand this complexity and they are challenging Putin in different fronts - economic, military and isolation, at the same time giving him the opportunity to change his policy. Sr. Bush used only military option to challenge Sadam...Putin is calculative - he is trying to inflame the Russian nationalism and preparing the Russian people to accept economic hardship in the name of honor to motherland. The outcome of this chess game will depend on the internal Russian condition - if there is no opposition within Russia to this dangerous path of Putin, Russia may ultimately be in another European War.","It will be a balancing act between economic stability and aggression to a sovereign country - Putin has to make this call now. He can be self destructive or visionary. The press reports indicate that Putin is a pragmatic and proud person - he is not a maniac. The present oligarchs circling him now will also guide him to come out of this mess. The only way to separate the crisis into two district issues - (1) Crimea, and (2) aggression to neighboring countries. I am confident that West and Russia will find the way to get out of this mess and avoid the a major catastrophic war in Europe.","Tom, agree with much of your analysis but again you default to clean energy as the answer to the crisis.

Through most of European and Euro-American history, the logic and actions of one country often seemed opaque to another, leading to inter-national miscalculations and as a result, a series of wars..We in the west--and Russia is only marginally so-- should not so much feel disappointed by Putin's actions, but rather feel grateful for our predecessors having developed as strong a sense of community as we today have.","Dear Mr Friedman.You make a very positive argument for a long term strategy..However, your hamfisted accusation that Mr Putin has enriched himself at the expense of the Russian people is irrelevant for strategy, dead worng, and you have absolutely no proof of it..Your case stands well on its own without this accusation, and the unfounded accusation actually  weakens your argument and, sad to say, your credibility in this particular piece..Otherwise your columns are always enjoyable and excellent.

bergamo,,,,"A few facts: Putin was elected democratically, like Yanukhovich. The acting president of the government the West has so enthusiastically embraced has been chosen by a mob in Maidan. Russia has made clear what it wants in Ukraine: a federal state that preserve the rights of minorities and a neutral state. These are reasonable proposals and the USA, with her European askars, should accept them, unless now the target is no longer Ukraine, but Russia herself.  The USA military and Germany's bankers cannot contemplate a country that does not have an American military basis or subscribes to the Washington consensus..I hope Russia cuts her relations with the West and strengthens her ties with China. Both countries must defend themselves against the West and have complementary economies, natural resources one and technology the other.  The West, particularly Europe, will continue its decline.","Putin is right. Ashdown's demonstrating with the rebels -- after all, Janukovich is the democratically elected president of Ukraine-- who include far right extremists, is  a symbol of the inability of the EU to have a sensible foreign policy..EU's foreign policy is still in the thrall of the cold war. An alliance with Russia would be far more useful than with the USA. We need energy that Russia has, and we have technology.  Russia should be invited to join the EU soonest..In Ukraine, the EU is meddling in the affairs of another country, whose democratically elected president has decided on a course of closer ties to Russia that he considers more useful for Ukraine than the hypothetical entry into the EU.

birddog,,,,More and more the 2014 version of Putin is sounding like the1939 version of Adolph Hitler just prior to launching Hitler's quest for Lebensraum ('Living Space') against Poland and Czechislovokia...And once again just like in 1939 the Europeans are just sitting on their hands...,"Look, until the Europeans (espcially the Dutch and Germans who are the Russian's biggest trading partners) realize that Putin's Thugocracy ,like the National Socialists before them, do not recognize anything but proportional counter strength, the world will continue to witness the gobbling-up of smaller countries or regional powers. Until then don't count on anything but weasel words about Humanitarin Concerns from Vlad's mouth.","Look, in my mind its way past time that the international community begins to demonstrate to the Putim regime that it will not tolerate any more instances of outlaw or thugish behavior aganist its neighbors. The Europeans in particular needs to make it clear that Putin and his Russian backers will begin to pay a heavy price if the Russians continues to act outside of international law and to begin to follow at least a minimal code of basic morality.","Want to stop further Russian expansionist actions? Try putting pressure on the Euros (especially Germany) to place sanctions on any European company and bank or bank doing business with the Russian Billionaires who are backing Putin's thugocracy. The Russia's wealthy are not stupid, they have their wealth tied-up in European banks and companies because they know that at any time Putin and his Kleptos could grab their wealth...No Money for arms and weaponery, no more War","Putin's plan resembles for his neighbors resembles nothing if not Hitler's idea of 'Lebensraum' or'Living Space' that helped launch WWII. My hope is that, contrary to the spineless early reaction by the West to Hitlers earlier aggression against his smaller neighbors, the West (and especially Germany) will launch an effective campaign of far reaching sanctions against the Russian businesses and corporations which prop-up Putin's Kleptocracy.","One would think that that region of Ukraine with Russian troops massed on the nearby border would be under heavy survailence by the US and our NATO allies via satelitte. With all our advanced imaging technology wouldn't the West's military analysts be able to tell where the missel was launched from, Ukraine territory, rebel held ground or from nearby Russian military installations? I only hope that if it is proved out that the rebels were behind this dasterdly deed using Russian supplied weaponery and guidance that the Europeans will finally come to their senses about the extreme dangers Valdimer Putin's expansionist policies hold for all its neighbors, and that the Euros cannot (once again) simply ignore a dangerous and powerful meglomaniac until he is holding them down with his boot on their collective necks.","If, as it seems, that a jetliner carrying passengers from the Netherlands (a NATO country) to Malaysia was shoot down by Terrorists supplied by Russia, I would expect that this would be enough to warrant a meeting by NATO's full Security Council. I hope and pray that the NATO allies finally, finally come to their senses and recognize that Russia under Putin has been operating as an outlaw regime for many years and simply working under the assumption that the Europeans will not support meaningful sanctions or actions against Russia because of simple greed and arrogance. Perhaps now President Obama's repeated calls for unity against this outlaw Russian regime will not simply fall on deaf and willfully ignorant ears.

Gennady,,,,"Ukraine matters  more than the war in Iraq against the Islamic State, a.k.a., ISIS.  I agree.  I do not think that Ukraine at this point needs primarily financial assistance.  It needs smart bombs so that it could target specific concentrations of terrorists and avoid civilian casualties.  Strikes against terrorists will keep the price of oil low and will discourage Putin from aggressive moves against NATO countries.  Putin builds Russia as a regional power that controls part of Europe.  He should not be allowed to accomplish this, certainly not vis-a-vis Ukraine or Belorus...Concentrating on NATO countries, Ukraine, and possibly Belorus is a good strategy.  You may wonder why Belorus.  Because, the Russian secret service is working on a series of protests to destabilize the situation in Belorus and bring it into closer inside the Russian orbit...So, all this means that with limited resources we should concentrate more on Europe.  That's a good strategy.  But that means that we will weaken our presence in the Middle East and allow Iran to become the regional power there (I do not think that anybody can take the Saudis seriously).  But then, what about Israel?  Are we leaving it to the dogs in that hostile environment?  We will be moral monsters if we do this.  That's how history should and will see us.","This is a very realistic piece.  The most important thing to remember is this:  There are forces of order in this world and forces of disorder.  Putin is a force of disorder.  The fact is that he has been involved in the Ukrainian situation from the very first moment the Maidan began and all he created is disorder.  It is time for him to step aside.   If the United States and the West wants to be the force of order, we should rethink our strategy.  At this point, we should concentrate on two areas:  Europe and the Middle.  We should work with the Europeans to bring the Atlantic alliance in order.  We should strengthen our ties to Europe.  The struggle for Europe is now in Ukraine.  We should support the Ukrainians and arm them.  They will do the rest.  Iran emerges as a regional power.  Maybe Iran can bring some order in the Middle East.  However, if we allow Iran to play this role, we must remember that Iran presents a major threat to Israel--our oldest and most reliable ally in the region.  We must do everything to ensure that Israel is protected.","Putin does not want peace in the region.  He wants his dominance in the region.  Our friends have an alternative to what we propose to do.  Fine.  Let's discuss this alternative.  That's what we are doing now.  If this alternative is not good, we'll drop it.  Even our friends in Europe guarantee that their proposal will lead to peace.  What if Ukrainians refuse to accept it?  What if they refuse to accept it even against their own government?  What if, and that's a very real if, there is a third Maidan?  Ukrainian volunteers are fighting now against Russian forces in the east.  The population of Ukraine collects money to arm them.  They are buying weapons all over the place wherever they can find.  When volunteers need nightscopes, people collect money and buy them.  That's unprecedented commitment to independence.  These people spent four months in bitter cold standing on the Maidan.  Do you think that they will easily accept Putin's noose?  Think again.",Mr. Putin continues to improvise.  He insists that Ukrainian forces should be withdrawn and that negotiations should open with the separatists but he makes no commitments of his part.  Why should he?  Russian forces are not officially in Ukraine.  Mr. Putin is too smart for his own good.  He wants to have his cake and eat it too.  The West should fully support Ukraine and arm its army.  It should apply new sanctions and strengthen the defenses of the NATO countries that border on Russia.  Mr. Putin should stop his shenanigans.,"If there is a ploy to invade Ukraine under the guise of humanitarian aid, it will be a disastrous invasion.  The Russian government has little interest in this region, other than to please the nationalistic audiences in their country.  Russia and its army has little stake in the region.  Few want to die for it.  For Ukraine, on the other hand, the stakes are very high--nothing less than the survival of their state.  The morale on the Ukrainian side is growing each day.  Ukrainians will fight and they will fight well.  And with the help of the international community they will be victorious.  Putin still hopes for some backstage compromise but I do not see any coming his way.  So, angry Russian nationalists will turn against him as one of the oligarchs.  They increasingly hate the corrupt regime of Putin and only tolerate it because of Russia's aggressive stance vis-a-vis Ukraine.  When the war is over, Russia will face a major internal crisis because the defeat will be a huge blow to the nationalists.  They will not forgive it to Putin.  Driven by poverty and despair they will lash out against the wealthy and the privileged.  It remains to be seen if Putin will be able to weather this storm.","Like Milosevic, Putin should end up in the court at the Hague.  He deserves it.",The video does not tell the whole story.  Poroshenko gave a verbal rebuff to Putin and went back to Ukraine.  The meeting has produced nothing.  Ukraine now must act and the West should support it.,"The meeting in Minsk is useless.  Putin has come to Minsk not to seek a genuine peace but to consolidate his gains and to tweak the nose of the international community.  I think Poroshenko understands this.  Even if he, for whatever reason, would agree to make peace with Russia to legitimate the current situation, the Ukrainian society would not accept this peace.  Putin and his government must be defeated in Ukraine.","There can be no agreement with Russia until it leaves completely the Ukrainian territory and restores Crimea to Ukraine.  Until this happens Putin's government should be a pariah in the international community.  It is an aggressor that seeks to dominate its neighbors.  Putin and his clique are sociopaths who cannot function in a society of equals.  They represent a perverse model of society based on domination and force, not equality and law.","Putin wants to force Ukraine on its knees but the larger agenda that looms behind this intention is to build an empire with the capital in Moscow and to create an alternative to the Western, or American, model of globalization.  Ukraine is important in political, economic, and geostrategic terms.  Ukraine is a vital source of military technology and production for making rockets and helicopters.  Putin and his team try to prevent Ukraine from choosing its own path.  He needs Ukraine to pursue his larger goals.  That's why he is so persistent.  The aspirations of the Ukrainian people to live in peace and freedom mean nothing to him.  All the countries in this region will be in grave danger while Putin's regime is in power."
KJ,,,,Diogenes is repeating another piece of propaganda that was long ago debunked - no promises were made to GorbachevUSSR about NATO expansion. It is readily apparent that the only real thing keeping Putin from grabbing up more ex-Soviet &amp; ex-Communist nations in Europe is the NATO coalition...<a hrefhttps:www.foreignaffairs.comarticlesrussia-fsu2014-08-11broken-promise titlehttps:www.foreignaffairs.comarticlesrussia-fsu2014-08-11broken-promise targetblank>https:www.foreignaffairs.comarticlesrussia-fsu2014-08-11broken-pro...<a>,You should read the article over again since it shows that Putin's propaganda efforts are an attempt at preventing the extension of USEU sanctions. It should be obvious from the efforts being put into that disinformation machine that sanctions are having a significant effect on the Russian economy. The effects of sanctions will become greater as time goes by with Russian governmentbusinesses need to pay off western loansbonds and to seek additional money from outside investors.,A good first step for preventative measures against Putin's future encroachment of the Baltic nations. Russia's hybrid-war of invasion in Ukraine revealed Putin's true goals of imperialist expansion and authoritarian control not only of his own countrymen but of those in neighboring nations aspiring to rule of law &amp; democracy.,This development is the exact opposite of what Putin hoped to achieve with his effort to influence USEU opinion through the use of internet propaganda. The strong response by his trolls and their fellow travelers here in this comments section confirms this. The positioning of heavy armaments in the Baltic &amp; other Eastern European nations of NATO is rather late and small - more needs to be done with urgency in response to Putin's use of hybrid-warfare in Ukraine. The nations of Eastern Europe that have and are seeking to strengthen their governance by rule of law and democratic principles must be supported by the US and the other NATOEU members.,"Its absurd to claim that Putin's walk into Crimea was decent or peaceful as it enabled the spread of violence by militants into the rest of east Ukraine. Russian citizens that crossed the border to aid in the seizure of Crimea traveled to other areas to help setup road blocks and seize government buildings elsewhere. Putin even admitted to placing unflagged special forces in Crimea, revealing that he lied earlier...The Russian invasion and occupation of Crimea was a major contribution to the violence that spread to the rest of Ukraine. At this point it is hard to know how sincere Putin is in his pull back; it may be a misdirection, it could be the USEU sanctions are having their intended effect, it could be he is now afraid of losing control of the violence he helped establish in East Ukraine or is realizing how expensive economically and politically it would be for Russia to actually annex a larger portion of Ukraine.","Dharma101,..- The snipers that killed Maidan protestors were Yanukovych's there is no actual evidence that they were not...- The Crimea referendum was held under Russian occupation after the invasion by unflagged Russian special forces (Putin admitted this recently)..- There is evidence that only between 15 and 30 of the population of Crimea actually voted for annexation by Russia...- The government in Kiev is represented by the Rada, whose members were elected in 2012 and the executive branch members; acting President, that the Rada necessarily had to appoint after voting to dismiss Yanukovych. There was no coup', junta or putsch involved in Yanukovych's dismissal; he was not forcibly detained, deported or killed by Maidan protestors or Rada members...- The violence in Maidan was due to Yanukovych's escalation of force to remove the protestors there which culminated in his using snipers to massacre protestors...- Nuland's intercepted call does not show that she controlled, paid or armed the Maidan protestors...- Putin had direct influence on getting Yanukovych elected in Ukraine, maintaining his natural gas blackmail of that country and persuading Yanukovych to drop his promises of developing closer ties to western Europe. Besides Putin's direct intervention in Crimea, which I already noted, he quite probably sent unflagged special forces into other parts of east Ukraine and has been providing at least moral support if not supplies to the militants there.","SU - It seems I have to repeat this again: Turkey is a member of NATO and would be required to act in concert with NATO if armed conflict should occur. Turkey would undoubtably help close the Dardanelles in assistance with NATO naval forces. Those other international treaties would mean nothing once war commenced...Shark - you must inhabit Putin's dream world if you think that Putin can simply march on Turkey with his military and annex it, that is ludicrous on its face. Not only would Russia be unable to invade and occupy Turkey against Turkish forces, other NATO nations would be required to come to its aid.","Putin may have thanked China in his speech but that does not mean that China has recognized Crimea's referendum as being legitimate, let alone the upcoming annexation. China abstained from voting in the UN Security Council meeting on the resolution condemning the Crimean referendum. Putin may take that as some kind of proof that China supports him whereas the west took it as an implicit disapproval. Unless China has announced its recognition of the referendum and annexation quite recently, I think they will try to straddle the line of not overtly approving or disapproving of those events as long as possible.",Comments here don't mean anything with respect to the opinion of any significant fraction fraction of Americans. Its clear there is a propaganda effort underway to confuse and make it appear that the American public somehow support Putin or are isolationists in the majority.,"The economic wealth, military might and populations of the US and EU are far greater than that of Russia. The illegitimate annexation of Crimea will prove to be a drag on Russia's economy not only due to the sanctions but also because Crimea produces little of economic value, that region of Ukraine was always subsidized by Ukraine's central government. What short term gains Russia has obtained by Putin's foolish invasion of Crimea will be reversed in the future by economic downturn and the social protests that will follow."
Keith Ferlin,,,,"Your position is sensible only if Putin clearly understands that acting with him on Syria does not make his aggression in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea acceptable the new normal. The sanctions imposed for that folly must stay in place until he removes himself from Ukraine and stops meddling in their internal affairs. The sanctions against Iran took some time for the cumulative effect brought the Iranians to the table. The same approach can work with Putin on the Ukraine, but only if the nations imposing the sanctions don't go wobbly on their resolve.","Maybe Putin is remembering the Chinese curse, be careful what you wish for, it may come true. When the reality of the full cost of annexing Crimea comes to fruition, his countrymen other than the Russian trolls that post on here may not feel so joyous about uniting Crimea with Russia. With a little more deft and tact he could have made an arrangement with new government in Ukraine to maintain their naval base in Crimea. The current government in Kiev realizes they have to work with Russia, they just didn't like being ruled by proxy from Russia through Yanukovich",So Putin in a roundabout way may provide the impetus for the EU and Greece to settle their differences in a constructive and amicable way. That would be the perfect scenario to have Putins machinations blow up in his face.,"Judy W, whom I don't believe lives in Cumberland, you need to ask Putin for some different talking points. The ones you have been trotting out have been discounted numerous times and are now getting stale. Just go to any number of publications around the world and They all discount your version of events.","I wonder what the NYT editorial board comment would be on Neville Chamberlains appeasement of Hitler. In the article you claim that Putin basically gave up nothing, and this is good deal when Putin is the aggressor in this whole mess. I am at a loss to understand your thought processes here.","People should not forget history and it's lessons. It is very rare, perhaps the first time I have agreed with John McCain. Putin is a bully and a thug. He does not respond to overtures, he considers them a sign of weakness. Trying to appease a bully and thug is a pointless game, remember the last bully and thug that Europe tried to appease. Remember how well that worked out. McCain is not suggesting boots on the ground but rather defensive weapons so that the Ukrainians can defend themselves and stop Putin from annexing any more of their country. Let the sanctions and resulting body bags piling up in Moscow from Ukraine being able to properly defend itself bring Putin to his senses. Let him feel the pain he is inflicting on others.",W won with a corrupt Supreme Court. How could Putin not understand that?,"Judy W, if that is your real name and if in fact you do reside in Cumberland Maryland, do you openly espouse these thoughts to your neighbours? I have been to Cumberland a number of times, wonderful city, great people...If you think Putin is so great emigrate to Russia and let us all know first hand how glorious it is to live under his wise rule.","While it may seem that he is improvising, I don't trust any statements coming from Putin's inner circle. That statement is meant to be misleading. Putin probably had a number of scenarios and his response to them already worked out. The man has been KGB for decades don't forget. When Bush, a man noted for his perception looked into Putin's eyes, he only saw what Putin wanted him to see.","Yes it is sad the tale of torture done by the US, it is sad that torture is done anywhere. Do you believe Putin has never used or authorized torture in his days at the KGB? Is that all you have to offer in an off topic way to this discussion?"
Common Sense,,,,"Ukraine would do well to fly its Russian prisoners to The Hague and turn them over to the World Court for further interrogation and processing, and eventual return to Russia.  This would leave Putin in the awkward position of negotiating with respected international authorities over their release, instead of continuing to lie about them while perhaps seeking to arrange a direct prisoner exchange directly with Ukraine...The Russian pretense of an exercise gone wrong is absurd given the absence of identifying markings and ID papers on the soldiers when captured.  There is a long-standing custom of war that soldiers who are disguised or otherwise stripped of national identification may be shot as spies or held as terrorists.  While I do not suggest Ukraine do this, it shows the seriousness of the Russian actions, exercise or not.","Welcome to the Cold War 2.0.  Please be sure your belts are tightly fastened, and enjoy the ride in perfect safety.  And thank you for choosing Putin's Cold War 2.0, the most spine-tingling ride in the world.","Does anyone remember when W met Putin for the first time, looked the man in the eye and got a sense of his soul.? ..Shame he didn't look twice. Obama, too.","Unfortunately for us Putin is a master manipulator and tactician, and he has us painted into a corner. We made him all-important in our efforts to save face from political and social disaster in Syria, and in accomplishing what we couldn't with Iran. Our administration is simply not as deft as his. With our help, he worked his way into a position of high value on those issues, and we risk unraveling everything if we push too hard...My prediction is we will holler and wave the US flag, push for sanctions that if enacted are very short-lived. And Putin will get Crimea, which is a valuable strategic peninsula. For him, it's a big win. For us, it's another blunder of our unfocused foreign policy and fascination with building little democracies everywhere.","Unfortunately for us Putin is a master manipulator and tactician, and he has us painted into a corner.

Certainly, we can't so much as appear to condone this brazen annexation. It doesn't matter that the Ukraine was corrupt and poorly led. And frankly it doesn't matter that Crimea voted yes. Imagine how many terribly run but resource-rich territories the US, Germany, France, or Japan could annex simply by marching in and saying, Hey do you want to join our country? The resounding vote in many cases would be yes but that doesn't justify the blatant diregard for national sovereignty. Such an action needs to be punished publicly...I would have kept Putin in the G8 to keep him from deepening associations with truly reprehensible regimes like Syria, Iran and North Korea and lobbied for loud and broad condemnation and sanctions from the G20.","As fingers are pointed at the separatists and Russia for probable guilty involvement, here's a simple question:..Could the separatists have captured Ukrainian rockets (which might be former Soviet) during their initial seizure of this part of Eastern Ukraine?  ..So far the speculation is that Putin's forces must have supplied rockets capable of shooting down the transport plane and then the airliner above 20,000 ft.  Do we know for sure that the rockets were not captured  Ukrainian arms?","We may ask Mr. Putin Will this action bring us peace in out time?  Is this the last of your territorial demands?..Yes, Mr. Putin, I am comparing you to another head of state from many years ago.  Someone whose aggression was finally stopped and reversed by Russians.  This is a mistake best fixed by Russians.  If not, Russia will suffer the slow isolation that previously stifled the Russian economy for 50 years...It is not that Ukraine was not in deep, self-inflicted trouble.  But unilateral invasion by Russia, by the United States, or by any other country is not the way to secure such crises.  Diplomacy and a multilateral peace-keeping force could have been arranged, if needed, quickly enough...If the Crimea needed help, this is not the right way to do it.  There is a difference between being a tough leader and just being a stupid bully.","Putin's popularity surged when he invaded Crimea.  Just as the outbreak of World War One caused nationalistic surges in each of the participating countries...Perhaps you recall that among the results of World War One was the devastation and loss of 13rd of Russia (including Ukraine) to Germany, and the fall of the Czar.  The fall of the Czar, Mr. Putin.  Enjoy your temporary surge in popularity.  Remember that just after the Gulf War President George H. W. Bush's popularity in the U. S. was at 94.","We may ask Mr. Putin Will this action bring us peace in out time?

KP,,,,"It 's instructive to see how many different myths are in circulation here among the host of posted comments. But to whom exactly is Putin trying to sell his?..His actions, as is so often the case in international relations, no less than in human ones, speak  for themselves. But if Russian citizens believe his rhetoric, then clearly that country under its current ruler wants to be assertive, even belicose if that achieves their national aims...Only that country can determine its best interests. We shouldn't expect anything less for the several countries of Europe which are more directly affected than the United States. If they feel threatened by Russia's behavior, they cannot be faulted for looking to their friends for help. And help is what the US has given Europe time and again. ..It is not some 'rogue element' in the State Department that's driving US policy, but the common ground of  most of the whole of the European continent. If those countries falter, as Putin might desire,  that's for them to decide. In the meantime, the United States for its part has to be patient and alert. That's all.","Many if not most of the comments on Roger Cohen's column today subscribe to the narrative that has the United States as the offending power, crowding or surrounding Russia with its alliances and provocations not only in Kiev but around the world. ..THe alternative story line has Putin's Moscow as the bully against its neighbors...Let us suppose, for the sake of this exchange of views prompted by Cohen's column, that neither narrative carries with it anything inexorable about it. Can we imagine for the moment, then, either version of the geo-political developments chronicled here necessarily dictates or determines only a single policy out come. ..In that state of suspended projected judgment can anyone see what if any common interests there are -- across Russia, Europe, the United States and the wider international community -- for a cessation of the fighting in the DonBass?  If the answer is yes, then why not start with what is supposed to be a ceasefire agreement, Minsk2, and expand the parties who are supporters of that resolution?  ..That accord was not meant to be the end of diplomacy but only the beginning of a longer, more robust joint effort to forge a return to peace and mutual respect of peoples and governments. Can Russia use its considerable influence in the region to support this process? Can the West concede that Ukraine's future neutrality in this era of revived East-West tension is worth talking about?","If this account holds up, it is a sign not of acceding to the wishes of Ukraine or the West but of a well timed act of 'magnanimity' on Putin's part. He has no further immediate need of a troop build up on the borders. Their presence has already achieved much of what Putin has sought -- a muscular 'opposition' in Eastern Ukraine. ..That alone insures that the politics in Ukraine have been altered sufficiently to give Russia and Russian residents a place at the table for Ukraine's constitutional future.","But if the evidence continues to accumulate that Mr. Putin and the rebels are carving out a permanent rebel-held enclave in eastern Ukraine,  la Transdniestria, Abkhazia or South Ossetia, he must know that the United States and Europe will be compelled to increase the cost...The trouble with this advice is that it has no anchor in time. The Russian aid to the rebels of Eastern Ukraine has been substantial for many months. How much more 'evidence' is needed to conclude that Putin is up to grinding down the country even if he will not  occupy it outright...That is an end game in itself for Putin and his New Russia ideology. Waiting to help Ukraine defend itself until that game is formally declared is naive in the extreme.","In his Moscow speech yesterday, President Putin thanked China 'for its support'. ..Is the world again multi-polar! Not two, but three?","@Ivan. You neglected to mention that the news of a ceasefire plan came from President Putin's 'seven point peace plan' announcement earlier today... If he announced it, why shouldn't the press consider Russia a 'side' in the Ukrainian conflict. If he is only a mediator, let him own the plan enough to push it forward and make his arguments for its adoption by Kyev and 'separtists'.","@CliffM-.Thanks. I had certainly wanted to believe that Kiev had some room in all this, but you've made it clear how mistaken I was...I'm afraid the 'West' and not just Ukraine has suffered a set back in the geopolitics of Eastern Europe. The moment when some muscular help from other countries for Ukraine might have stood up to the beefed up Russian presence has passed...But it was clear early on, wasn't it, that 'the West' would not militarily stand up to Russia, even indirectly, so the initiative was always on Putin's side. And he has adroitly played his hand that way. ..Advantage New Russia....","This is diplomacy at work. Thank you, John Kerry, Mr.Lavrov and the others. Small steps could lead to more. Now, or soon, if President Putin might be persuaded to disperse his forces on the Ukrainian border, we could all take with more confidence his claim, often repeated, that Russia has no intention of invading Ukraine.","Yes, of course you are right. My use of the anachronism was meant both as a compliment (to the bravery of the Russian people) and a comment on the Soviet style mind set of Putin and company. ..Thanks.","the tragedy would not have happened if Kiev had maintained a cease-fire.'..Yes, that's what Putin said just a day or so after the shoot-down. Is there any clearer indication of his thinking: this is our way of responding to your insistence on putting down the armed insurgency in your country?"
Peter,,,,"Putin loves power and money.  Ask Bob Kraft.  When he let Putin try on his Super Bowl ring, Putin is reported to have said, I could kill someone with this, whereupon he pocketed the ring and walked away.  Kraft never got his ring back.  To me the metaphor that fits Putin is a capo mafioso with nukes.  I've been very surprised at the milquetoast US reaction to the invasion of Ukraine, although freezing assets of oligarchs was a good start.  Putin's weakness must be his love of power and money.  Can you force a mafioso to the negotiating table if you confiscate his Rolls, his mansion, free his mistresses and turn his loyal pack against him?","Putin has been testing his boundaries for more than a decade and a half now and has sought to exploit the wars in the Middle East to his advantage by invading Crimea and Ukraine, hoping the U.S. and its allies would either be distracted or unwilling to push back. As he inches forward slowly but surely, NATO allies have sought Americas assistance with tanks, weapons, and related defense components.  At this point, Putin has forced NATO's diplomatic hand and if fortifying the Baltic countries makes him think twice about making a future land grab, then this decision will be worth it.","Putin has been testing his boundaries for more than a decade now and has sought to exploit the wars in the Middle East to his advantage by invading Crimea and Ukraine, hoping the U.S. and its allies would either be distracted or unwilling to push back.

Military and political actions won't work. Putin is a thug, but even a thug understands that with a weak economy he will rapidly lose popular support.","It is so sad to see Roger Cohen, who is has been always so reasonable about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and US-Iran relations turning into someone who believes that war can improve anything. Because, yes, sending arms into Ukraine is war, whether we like it or not.  And although Putin is a odious dictator starting war with him is still not the same as starting war with Hitler. And remember, Saddam Hussein was an odious dictator gassing his own people, we declared war, deposed him and made a paradise of Iraq..or didn't we ? An old proverb, an ounce of peace is worth more than a ton of war, is true, we should continue talking.","Unfortunately, the first people whom the author should complain about are not Putin and company, but the politicians ruling Kiev until now. By that I mean not only the stealing thug Yanukovich, but also his proWestern predecessors - i.e. Jushchenko and Timoshenko who were unable to achieve anything positive except squabbling among themselves. And the ones who rule Kiev now are already repeating virtually the same failed policies - in a country falling politically and economically apart among the first newly adopted laws was one that would deprive the Russian language of the status of one the official languages of the country. This cannot justify the Russian invasion, but how can anyone wonder that the Russian part of the population succumbs to paranoia and separatist tendencies?","Sanctions must be expand to apply to crush Russia's petro state. Russian citizenry, rendered impotent, cowardly by the regime, is cheering Putin on, and no less guilty. Russian propaganda is effective in it's simplicity of lies.","Putin's approach is using the energy leverage to impose his will on the West by playing power games. Those who know a little history can make a parallel between Putin political approach to Hitler's. Annexation of Crimea is similar to annexation of Sudetenland - both claimed the action was done to protect their compatriots. But Putin like Hitler, drunk with power and adoration of his people, made few fatal miscalculations which might ultimately undermine his political stability. Before Russia will sell a single cubic meter of gas to Turkey or increase the flow of gas to China, Russia's economy is likely to collapse. Stronger Western resistance to Putin's manipulations will further isolate Russia and may fuel a growing internal resistance.","Putin's approach is using the energy leverage to impose his will on the West by playing power games.

Indeed Bush and Putin make a really scary couple..
Jerzy Najdowski,,,,"Putin miscalculated Western reaction to his recent policy, which results from his diplomatic victory in Syria, UE's pemanent problems with defining their foreign policy and military weakness (Libia case) and President Obama idea of resetting U.S. - Russia relationships. He is a skillful policy player but still underestimates economic issues. Russian economy is weak and this has a huge impact on its real military power. Old generals still think in terms of numbers of tanks or armoured vehicles (remember Stalin asking how many tanks Vatic had?) and just lack economic knowledge. Effect: Putin wants to discuss crisis in one of the largest ex-Soviet  republics with America. Could you imagine it in the 1980s?","Given European history, talking about historical rights to some territory on this continent is like opening Pandora's box. This refers particularly to Central and Eastern Europe, where state border changed a couple of times over the last 200 years and there are numerous places to which somebody may have historical rights. Saying so in Crimea Putin does not de-escalate the conflict and proves that he does not care what other countries will do and how people  there will feel. This also shows his cynicism - as long as former Ukrainian president guaranteed Russian interests in Ukraine Mr Putin did not claim historical rights to Crimea or Donbas..On the other hand, Russians may feel they have historical rights to the south-eastern part of Ukraine. The problem is Ukrainian borders were determined during Soviet times  by the Ukrainian Sovet gensek and not by the Ukrainian people. The question is whether this problem can be solved in a la Putin way. If we accept it, we will give consent to changing any state border status quo in any part of the world and admit that, well, in some cases international pacts are ineffective because of historical rights etc. This is not going to make the world safer. No matter how we interpret the history.","Mr Putin's spokesman said that there was no connection between the annexation and energy resources and Russia has never cared about the oil and gas in this area. This sounds like a joke. Is there any country in the world claiming that it has so big resources that is not interested in any more although it is close to its border? He should have also said that they learned about only after annexation of Crimea....It seems that this is the main reason why Moscow annexed this part of Ukraine - it is gaining a geostrategic advantage, as Ukraine's access to the Black Sea has become considerably limited. Regardless of effectiveness of possible sanctions imposed on Russian energy companies, Ukraine will not be in position to extract any resources here in the foreseeable future.

sophia,,,,"@michjas:  What about Bush's pre-emptive war tactic?  Now Russia wants in on the rigged game.  America needs to really clean up her act before claiming the high moral ground.

America has no moral high ground.  Putin is a tyrant.

Someone planned all this.  Who?  Where were these uniforms made?..Nothing spontaneous about this.  Like the knives that the murderers in Rwanda ordered way ahead of time from China, this has all been planned.  Putin probably knew he was going to do this and ordered the military exercises that took place this week in tandem with it.  He's foxy.  But he may have outfoxed himself this time.  Let's hope so...I support President Obama in this and working with the EU.  If McCainPalin were in power we'd have three new wars.  People such as Bill Kristol and Lindsey Graham, and other neocons, must not let their hysteria take us to another dark place.  This country will crack if we get into another war.  Bush's pre-emptive war took away America's high moral ground.  Putin knows it.  I doubt if Putin pushes this to war; he knows what the economic costs to Russia would be.

Unfortunately, Mr. Obama is not good at that.","If the U.S. threatened Canada or Mexico the way Putin is threatening Russia, the world would be up in arms. The Ukrainians have the right to be independent and not be a satellite state of Russia. That said, the U.S. and Nato should stay out because Russia seems hypersensitive about its bordering countries. Also, with all the talk about the Ukraine joining a democratic Europe, one has to remember Europe's dark, nazi and fascist history, so I can see why Russia may be concerned.",Nonsense! Putin has calculated his options and the prospect of deeper sanctions thrusting his economy into a  tailspin are far more important than a few regions of Ukraine.  I believe he has accepted the fact that Ukraine is now an EU country and is recalculating the importance of a longer term relationship with the West. What you are now watching is a fundamental shift in Russia's position.,The answer for Russia is to pay for Crimea in cash or gas - making the Ukraine an offer the Ukraine cannot refuse. This will provide security for Russia's naval fleet. And then Putin has to stop and totally back off on the rest of the Ukraine. Otherwise things are only going to get a lot worse.,The answer for Russia is to pay for Crimea in cash or gas - making the Ukraine an offer the Ukraine cannot refuse. This will provide security for Russia's naval fleet. And then Putin has to stop and totally back off on the rest of the Ukraine.

We need some better chess players in our diplomatic ranks. If Putin takes over Ukraine, where will he stop?","Although I think Putin is nothing but a dictator with pretensions of grandeur that needs to be stopped, I keep thinking of two things - the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the political wars in this country - including the extremist politicians in this country. It is conceivable to me that the leader of another country, such as Russia, may look at the United States and think that we are unreliable and untrustworthy because of our invasion of Iraq and unstable because of the gridlock and extremists in Washington - or at least that there is an element of unreliability, untrustworthiness and instability that has to be considered. Our military is armed to the teeth. Therefore, conceivably Putin could be thinking that he does not want the U.S. or its allies even close to his backyard.  But one has to remember that at least on the Atlantic side there is a large ocean between the U.S. and Russia and that so far our allies in Europe have pretty much refused to muster large armies since WW2.","This is an amusing point of view.   The reality on the ground, as the article makes fairly clear, is that the people of Ukraine (well armed, apparently) have taken a hand.  Their elected (corrupt, pro-Russian) government has been overthrown.  Their new unelected government (pro-EU) does not control the eastern part of the territory (one hesitates to call it a country).   The US, Russia, the EU and the rump Kievan government make a deal that no one can enforce.  Neither the US nor  Russia can impose its will without the cooperation of the effected local people in the eastern part of Ukraine.  Somebody (Russia and the US together?  The UN?) ought to establish machinery for a legitimate vote in the east to see what the people actually want. If they want federation with the west of Ukraine (and if the westerners agree), fine.  If they want to attach themselves to Russia (and Russia agrees), fine.   If they want to be their own country, whatever.   It is not Messrs. Putin and Obama's (nor Ms. Tymoshenko's) to decide.","Sounds like the same playbook that Russia is following in Syria. And we are the dupes that go along with it. I don't think it would be a good idea to send our troops there, but I think if Putin directly or indirectly takes over the Ukraine, or a part of it, it should pay a very big price - economically and otherwise. Putin for no reason is creating issues and conflict where it should not exist.","Wow, the arm chair patriots of the Times have found a politically correct issue to get nationalistic about!  Russians out of Crimea!  The editorial position is absurd.  As a number of commentators have noted, Crimea is not only majority Russian, it is a critical Russian naval base and has been for centuries.  It could as easily and logically have been (and can as easily and logically be) part of Russia as part of Ukraine.   These entities are REGIONS.  They were not nations or states before World War II.   Russia's interests in Crimea are, in Russia's view, existential.   We couldn't do a thing about it if we wanted to.  Are we going to start WW III over the Russian flag flying in a territory that was effectively Russian already?  Moreover, the Russians are CRITICAL partners on all sorts of vital international security, economic and environmental issues.   We should be talking to Putin's government about a peaceful resolution that secures Russia's interests and grants the populations of the Ukrainian and Crimean regions a voice in their respective futures.  We shouldn't be rattling military or economic sabers.  This isn't a high school football game."

Richard,,,,"What really matters is what the Russian people believe.  Putin has done a terrific job of contolling and selling his truth, something that seems almost inpossible in the information age.  The fewer options at Putin's disposal, the more likely he is to choose one not to our liking.","So what should we do?  Another Obama Red Line?  That will really shake up Putin.  Should we target Putin and company with drones?  Boots on the ground in Eastern Ukraine?  There are no good options.  NATO is useless because apart from the US and sometimes the UK, they're all pacifists with minimal defense budgets.","Let Putin have Syria and begin work on a peace negotiation..The international community must start building refugee camps in places like Iraqi Kurdistan and relieve the pressure on places like Jordan and Turkey..Stop the flow of migrants into Europe..Germany must halt their open door policy; it's causing chaos and unrest. Begin organized, legal and pragmatic immigration from the Middle East and Africa into Europe..Slow the chaos.","I don't see any leftists supporting the idea of Russians killing Syrians or Muslims. Personally I kind of like Putin's willingness to walk right into this morass and take Russia with him. Soon lots of Syrians and Arabs and Muslims of all descriptions will hate him and Russia too. I'm okay with that. Does Syria have any oil? If not, then what's the point of helping them? Maybe Russia is hoping to score points with Iran? Good luck with that.",It becomes pretty clear that the only thing that will save Ukraine is NATO troops being invited by the Ukrainian Government to stop the de facto annexation of Eastern Ukraine and Crimea by Russia. ..Stopping Putins agression in the former soviet client states in eastern Europe is going to take more than economic sanctions it is going to take match Putins troop movements and calling him on his aggressions.  This may lead to violence but one thing is certain if we don't stop Putin in Ukraine we will be much closer to World War III over further aggression that weakness in the Ukraine crisis will certainly encourage.,"Those sanctions we put on them now do not do much as of right now, but over a while it will be very damaging to russia. As from the post by Serge, then Putin is lying about troop removal.. then what dose he plan to do? and dose anyone else remember that he has nukes in the Crimea on those hovercraft he sent? I do.","I am interested in the response of Germany and France to the continued fighting and its view as to whether the cease-fire agreement encompassed these ongoing hostilities. Assuming that the continued fighting is a violation of the agreement (and I have to think that it is) and assuming that the Ukrainian government still wants weaponry from the US (and I have to think that it does), then it is time to impose further economic sanctions on Russia and to provide the Ukrainian government the defensive weapons that it seeks. ..I have only over time reached the conclusion that I have reached, and even in retrospect, I believe our response to the provocations in the Ukraine has been prudent and properly measured. But I also believe that it is time to increase the costs to Russia for its outrageous conduct. I understand that short-term Putin gains politically at home by his actions. But let's see  whether he can maintain his popularity and power if the costs to Russia for its aggression become higher economically and militarily, and whether Russia might temper its aggression if the Ukraine's power to resist can be materially increased.","When Putin says he's withdrawn Russian troops from the Ukrainian border, it just means that he views the border of Russia as including New Russia aka Eastern Ukraine.","As deeply troubling as the unlawful annexation of Crimea by the usually poker-faced Putin is, the openly disdainful and mocking response by his deputy prime minister to U.S. sanctions provides a penetrating insight into Putin's mindset and Russia's likely future actions in eastern Ukraine and beyond.  It should serve as a resounding wakeup call to the U.S. and E.U.","It's difficult to understand US strategy here.  Having allowed Russia to invade and annex Crimea as well as support its proxy insurgents in Ukraine seeking cessation, do we expect Putin to be deterred by NATO's saber rattling in Eastern Europe?  Are NATO members whose territory borders Russia ready to defend themselves when and if Russia starts protecting Russian speakers in those states by helping them launch a civil war?  Or should we ready ourselves for nuclear  Armageddon?  We are provoking the Russian bear, but we don't seem to have worked out an effective way to keep him caged."
Robin Foor,,,,"Mr. Cohen gives more credit to Putin than Putin deserves.  Putin's policies are really cheap political prejudice. The lies published by Russian disinformation show clearly that the Russian regime is one of the most corrupt since Nazi Germany.  Any crime - causing an airliner crash, shooting down a civilian airliner,  assassination using a radioactive element, invasion of a neighboring country - is simply denied with lies, propaganda and doctored photographs. ..Putin lacks the intellect to understand that institutions must be created that survive individuals and provide for democratic social progress under the rule of law.  People are mortal but the law lives forever. ..Russia must import capital to grow the Russian economy.  Putin's policies of  prejudice and aggression prevent the investment of capital in Russia.  Russia's economy will decline. ..The Russian business community will not accept decades of economic decline. Ironically, Ukraine and Russia both want to trade with the European Union.  Now that sanctions slow trade, does Russia better understand why Ukraine seeks increased business with the EU? ..There is no military question that NATO equipment and troops are coming to Eastern Europe.  Putin has caused these deployments by invading the Ukraine. ..Eastern Europe is not a colony of Russia.  Under the Yalta agreements, Eastern Europe is to be free and independent with democratically elected governments.  Now it is time for Russia to follow these agreements.","Ukraine needs to take live prisoners from the militants and put their Russian army picture Id and dog tags in evidence before the UN Security Council.  Ukraine is a member of the UN.  Invading Ukraine with small units is a crime and a violation of the UN Charter...The so-called separatists are on active duty in the Russian military. They are carrying Id cards and wearing dog tags. Taking live prisoners and proving to the world before the media, and before the UN,  that Russia has invaded Eastern Ukraine is a first step in prosecuting Putin for his crimes.","Putin is drawing in the West to a military confrontation.  The war is on Russia's doorstep, easy for Russia to support, far away and costly for the West. It is a war of attrition that keeps Ukraine impoverished. Russia intends to keep Crimea and to dominate the Ukraine, forcing Kiev to have  a pro-Russian government  Old fashioned 19th century imperialism. ..Putin murdered hundreds of innocent Russians in the apartment bombings of 1999, in order to gain power.  In Ryazan the three suspects that planted a bomb were detained and produced FSB identification cards. They were  released on orders from Moscow. Journalists and members of a committee that sought to investigate the case were assassinated. ..A serial killer does not negotiate. Violence has rewarded Putin with power and popularity.  He will continue false-flag acts of provocation to draw the West into war. ..The most effective weapon we have is the truth.  The West should send out the truth on the Internet and other media,  broadcast the truth to the Russian people and to the Russian army in the field in Ukraine and in Russia. The Russian people must be told about the monster in the Kremlin.","Putin is attacking the free market. Ukraine wants to join a free-market organization, the European Union.  Putin is trying to force Ukraine to join a customs union controlled by the Russian state, the Eurasian Economic Union. ..State control of the economy is part of Soviet doctrine. The Soviet Union that Putin is re-creating has state control of industry as a primary economic principle.  Industry and property are owned by members of Putin's inner circle, but these interests are controlled by the Russian government.  The Russian courts issue political decisions, to take away property from anyone who does not follow Russian government orders. ..State control is a disaster for the Russian economy - which has not diversified and has not become internationally competitive nor internally efficient - and state control will be a disaster for Russia's conquered territories, including the Ukraine and the members of the Eurasian Union. ..Those who argue that Russia has a low sovereign debt to GDP ratio mistakenly exclude Russian corporate debt, which is subject to default under sanctions and is actually controlled by the Russian state.  Junk is the correct status for Russian debt. ..Russia is at war with the free market. Russia's aggression will not stop at the Ukraine's border with Poland.  The Baltic States have joined the European Union. No one should be surprised by Russia's invasion of the Baltic States. ..Europe is disarmed.  Plans must be made to defend the Continent.","Russia is spiraling down as it fails to diversify its economy, open its channels of communication, protect intellectual property, and practice the rule of law.  Russia must import capital to grow.  Putin's plan is violent conquest, to steal what his country is unable to produce. ..Putin's customs union makes no sense if it includes former Soviet countries.  A customs union makes more sense if Russian armies push their way to the English Channel.  Putin is conducting first strike rehearsals, apparently thinking that a nuclear war could be fought and won. ..But nuclear war brings nuclear winter, which falls hardest on Russia. Frozen for years without summer, no crops, no food, little would be left of Russia.  So the Russian generals threaten to destroy their own country, which is least suited to absorb thousands of nuclear punches. ..Loose talk indicates a lack of thinking through the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons.  George Washington established the Atlantic alliance as the centerpiece of his foreign policy.  Putin is not going to break the Atlantic alliance, nor the alliances with other Englishspeaking countries. ..The Baltic States are NATO countries and they will be defended by force. Anyone who doesn't understand that should read the written agreements more carefully.",China will not  engage in adventures against the whole world designed to further Putin's personal ambitions.  The President of China does not ride with outlaw motorcycle gangs. ..Only a fool would believe that China would put the legacy of Dung Xhaoping and Zhou Enlai at risk for the sake of Putin's future post-apocalyptic glory.,"For years it was obvious to observers that Putin would take control of Crimea when he returned to power in 2012.  Although NATO is not a threat to Russia, and although Russia has treaty rights to maintain its naval base in Crimea, Putin was expected to seize the Crimea as a matter of personal ambition. ..The fact that a Russian oligarch published a paper to justify the occupation of Crimea is no surprise and may have been sponsored by the Kremlin to provide a justification. ..The only real threat to a nuclear armed nation is the nuclear arsenals that exist, even if the arsenals are thousands of miles away.  Affiliation with a treaty organization like NATO is not a threat to a nuclear armed nation. ..Ballistic missiles, whether they are in China or the US, under the sea or in the air, are a threat.  Fleets of heavy bombers are a threat.  Aircraft carriers and ballistic missile submarines are a threat. Large scale cyber war is a threat.  Ukraine, one of the poorest countries in Europe, has none of these and is not threat to Russia. ..Destruction of the economy of a neighboring country, like the Ukraine, is not helpful to Russia.  Russia had the opportunity of achieving prosperity by trading with the West, as China has, yet instead of doing business and allowing investment to grow the economy, Russia aggressively invaded two neighboring countries - Georgia and Ukraine.  ..This does not make Russia safer.  The real threats are still there. Now Russia is less prosperous.","The Russians will simply use the ceasefire agreement to seize more territory.  If weapons are pulled back by the Ukrainians, the Russian army - which is not there anyway - will move forward...The press, including this newspaper, continues to refer to units of the Russian army as pro-Russian separatists.  It is time to call a rat a rat.   Russia is carrying out this aggression.  It is an invasion of a sovereign country. ..If the Russian army isn't there, then Russia won't mind if the Ukrainians  obtain Russian code books, maps and field radios from Russian forces.   ..We don't need to ship arms directly to Ukraine. If we provide the money the Ukrainians can buy weapons from any source they like. ..We can ship millions of tons of logistical material - food, field kitchens, medicine, field hospitals, building materials, armored bulldozers, bridge building equipment, road building equipment, communications equipment, trucks, fuel, railroad building equipment, container port cranes, and other 21st century equipment to help the Ukrainians fight Russia. ..Russia can lose the battle. We have the endless volume of supply lines that Russia does not have. In a shipping contest, Russia will eventually react by trying to close the supply line, interfering with shipping and preventing transportation. These will be acts of war by Russia, on the Black Sea or in the air. ..It is either appeasement or opening the supply lines to the Ukraine.  Putin is a gangster who will not back down.","While units of the Russian army are operating in the Ukraine, the press continues to call these Russian army units Pro-Russian separatists...The Russian economy is collapsing. Sanctions and low oil prices make Russian government spending plans a roadmap to bankruptcy for the Russian state. Putin has started a war and is planning a 33 increase in defense spending this year.  That looks a lot like planning a major war or even planning a world war.  Russia cannot afford both a civilian economy and a major war. ..Arming the Ukraine will trigger an outright public invasion of the Ukraine by Russian army units that are not already in the Ukraine.  But the Ukraine is a country of 40 million people, and we have seen what a medium size country can do in resisting a foreign invasion in Iraq.  A long war of attrition by the people against a conventional army can be very costly for Russia...As long as the sanctions last and the price of oil stays low Russia's economy will continue to collapse. Putin will continue to lash out and to attack the world. ..Putin started a war to prove that Russia is a superpower even if the truth is that Russia is a bankrupt country in Europe.  Russia is desperate now because its economy is falling into a deep recession.","Syria is in chaos created by Russian weapons and supplies. Doubling down on state-sponsored violence does not always restore order. ..Putin resorts to violence, not merely seeking to restore calm.  He is a violent man who is digging a deep hole in Syria.  Just as he has already done more damage to Russia than anyone since Stalin, now he escalates a losing situation in Syria. ..Putin has already started multiple wars - Chechnya, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Ukraine and now boots on the ground in Syria. Putin started out with the Moscow apartment bombings against his own people. ..The resort to violence is a feature of his psychology. As he is losing the war in Syria more violence is likely.  In Syria he is surrounded by more powerful forces.  He has no understanding of solving a quagmire with diplomacy."
Swans21,,,,"Not sure why the Times invites comments on stories like this ... surely they know that the same internet troll organizations that they have reported on this paper (to be in the Magazine this Sunday) will come out in force to post phony pro-russian comments...For those who complain about corruption in this country, yes, that is the case.  What they leave out is the magnitude:  putin's gov't is a kleptocracy; the U.S. gov't, with all its faults, is not.  And, one can criticize one source with explicitly listing all sources (you know, like walking and chewing gum at the same time)...russia has behaved in a cowardly manner in Ukraine and Crimea.

I would argue Yeltsin was more liberal than Putin is, who calls the Ukrainians fascists ... well, it takes one to know one!..Russian history starts with the need to have a safe road form the North to the Black Sea - yes, that's called imperialism, and other ethnic groups should not have to forego their right to self-determination and national dignity to feed russian imperial designs.","Robert, thanks for bringing up the Tatars, who are often forgotten (out of convenience by the russians).  They are a truly oppressed minority, having been mistreated over the centuries at the hands of the russian and soviet authorities.  After realizing some piece under Ukrainian rule, now they are forced to contemplate being at the mercy of the russians again.  But putin will have his lebensraum .....For the people who think this is great news for Ukraine, and that people can just uproot themselves and move, consider how you would feel if you were forced to leave a place you have probably lived for centuries, where your job is, etc.  Cruel and insensitive does not begin to describe your thinking.","Perhaps the author should send this piece over to the Fox Propaganda Channel, where this entire episode has been portrayed as the chessmastermacho man putin winning against our supposedly weak, ineffectual president (well, everything is Mr. Obama's fault in their eyes, isn't it?)  Interesting to see that perhaps putin is not mastering this crisis as the right-wing would have us believe, but rather making it up as he goes along, cheaply appealing to the baser instincts of his abused people...And, honestly, what could our administration do on top of what it has done already?  putin is no heroic figure in this, he is bullying people in his backyard, clearly knowing that even if the USEurope wanted to militarily confront him, there would still be little we could do.  A profile in cowardice ....","...cowards in the West .....So, what would you have us in the West do that is not so cowardly?  putin is the coward, he sends occupation forces into Crimea knowing that militarily, there is nothing anyone can do about it.  He is the regional power...I am disgusted by russia's imperialism and oppression against Ukraine, but realistic enough to know that outside economic levers, we have limited options.  Unless, of course, you want to mount a full-scale invasion, which would engulf the region in something resembling world war, and cause millions of deaths.","These must include far-reaching trade and financial penalties that will be painful and costly to both sides. It is imperative that Mr. Putin see a united front...Nowhere is the NYT advocating war, clearly, you did not read this editorial.  Hit them hard in the wallet is the message.",,,
Chris M,,,,"Note to editor:  the phrase Russia's intervention in Crimea and Ukraine should read something akin to Russia's invasion and occupation of Crimea and intervention in other parts of Ukraine.  From an international law perspective, Crimea was and remains part of Ukraine.  And Russia did not intervene in a conflict in Crimea, it invaded the region and took control by military force.  ..That being said, Russia does have legitimate interests in the situation in the Middle East, and those interests do not perfectly align with the interests of the US.  Russia has good reason to view ISIS as a significant threat, and the US and Europe need to acknowledge Russia's interests and try to figure out a strategy that takes those interests into account.  If Roosevelt and Churchill could work with Stalin when necessary, the US and Europe should be able to work with Putin now.","Which narcissistic little creep are you referring to, Putin or Snowden? ..I presume you mean Snowden, since the comments I have seen in past months lauding Putin as a strong leader seem to have come from the Right.","I'm not sure how optimistic Mr. Kozyrev's view is, given that Putin is not going anywhere soon, but I agree wholeheartedly with his assessment of Russia and its people.  And it's nice to see someone speaking about Russia from a balanced perspective.","President Obama said yesterday (Thursday) that the forces fighting against the government of Ukraine are trained by Russia, armed by Russia, and funded by Russia. While that is all true, he left out the most important fact - that a large portion of those forces ARE Russian.  Russian forces currently are invading Ukraine. Period. It's a war even if it has not been declared. ..So long as the US and Europe fail to acknowledge that fact and take action - rather than talk about what they might do - Putin is going to continue this invasion.  President Obama spoke of the unwavering commitment of the United States to Ukraine and its people. Unless there is a lot going on behind the scenes, I have to wonder what that commitment means. ..The only way to stop this war without Russia effectively taking another bite out of Ukraine - and likely not stopping there - is to put western peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine (under the OSCE banner). That will NOT start a war with Russia; Putin knows full well that the Russian military is still no match for western forces and he will not take on a war that he cannot win. Peacekeepers will also give Putin the face-saving political cover (i.e., ethnic Russians living in Ukraine will be protected) to stop the fighting in Ukraine.  Nothing else is going to stop Putin's war; he is very happily let this conflict simmer indefinitely.","Query - from what threat do you think Putin is protecting ethnic Russians?  Ethnic Russians were not being attacked by Ukrainians in Crimea or eastern Ukraine - that justification for sending Russian troops into Ukraine is completely false.  In fact, since Putin first became prime minister of Russia, many, many times more Russian citizens have died at the hands of Russian security forces than have died from the actions of all other governments combined.  Who shall protect Russians from Putin?","While a lot of smart people have agreed with Mr. Friedman that NATO should not have expanded east, Estonians, Latvians, Poles, and Lithuanians have always disagreed, and the events of the past year (and even going back to the Russian invasion of Georgia) have demonstrated that their concerns were valid.  Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine (and Georgia and Moldova) were not the result of the expansion of NATO.  Rather they are the result of the country again being controlled by unreformed believers in the Soviet Union intent on reestablishing domination over their neighbors (as well as enriching themselves).  The Baltic and Eastern European countries have always understood the possibility of Russian hardliners trying to reassert authority over their neighbors.  Unfortunately, unlike other former members of the Eastern block, the Russian security services were never reformed, and Russia's post-Soviet leaders have almost entirely been products of the Soviet system, either from the Soviet government, the security services, or Komsomol.  Many of those people believe, as Putin stated, that the demise of the Soviet Union - not WW1 or WW2 - was the greatest tragedy of the 20th Century.","Relatively speaking, Russia's military today is nowhere near as strong as the German military was at the outset of WW2.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been successful only because Putin correctly assumed that once he got Russian troops into the country, the West would not be willing to send in NATO troops to oppose them.  But Putin fully understands that the Russian military is still no match for NATO.  If the EU and the US had agreed to send troops into Ukraine early this Spring, before the actual fighting had begun (preferably under the auspices of the OSCE), Russia would not have risked war with the West by sending Russian troops into Ukraine.","President Obama just said that the forces fighting against the government of Ukraine are trained by Russia, armed by Russia, and funded by Russia.  Well, yes, but that avoids the main point - that a large portion of those forces ARE Russia.  Russian forces currently are invading Ukraine. Period.  So long as the US and Europe fail to acknowledge that fact and take action - rather than talk about what they might do - Putin is going to continue this invasion.  President Obama also spoke of the unwavering commitment of the United States to Ukraine and its people.  Unless there is a lot going on behind the scenes, I have to wonder what that commitment means.  The only way to stop this war without Russia effectively taking another bite out of Ukraine is to put western peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine (under the OSCE banner).  That will not start a war with Russia; Putin knows full well that the Russian military is still no match for western forces and he will not start a war that he cannot win.  Peacekeepers will also give Putin the face-saving political cover (i.e., ethnic Russians living in Ukraine will be protected) to stop the fighting in Ukraine.","Revoking residency visas is an absurd proposal, even if it was not intended to be taken seriously.  Punishing people for the crime of being Russian is neither just nor helpful.  Many Russians live in the US (and other countries outside Russia) precisely because they wanted to get away from Putin's Russia.  They do not support Putin or his policies.  Most Russian emigres are productive contributors to the US economy and society.","Quit your saber-rattling, Alex.  In a non-nuclear war, Russia is no match for NATO and Putin knows that.  So, in the unlikely circumstances you describe (i.e., NATO in Ukraine), the question would be, would Putin start a war that would have one of two possible outcomes: (1) Russia's military defeat or (2) nuclear war.  Putin may be out of touch with reality in some respects, but he's not stupid."

The rules of the diplomatic game have long since been made up, but Russia, as always, seeks to change them as they see fit, in order to suit them.",Putin actually had the nerve to suggest that Poland was responsible for the start of the war during a speech some years before.

By doing so, we'd be betraying our principles, abandoning a peaceful country to an aggressive dictatorship next door, and encouraging further adventurism by Moscow. We've tried to write off countries before (Czechoslovakia being the most famous example), and that didn't work out too well. Furthermore, we have some moral--and, to a certain extent, legal--obligations to ensure Ukraine's security, for example through the OSCE and the Budapest Memorandum, so the US's credibility is also at stake...Your touchy-feely advocacy of peace and cooperation among nations is very nice--I like singing kumbaya around the campfire as much as the next guy--but do you really think that that's Putin's attitude?

Considering the example of Hitler, we can expect that if we let one invasion stand, there will be others.  Therefor, I can only approve of sending weapons and a limited number of troops to Eastern Europe.  It's a good signal.  It doesn't 'rock the boat'.  Putin already did that.  On the contrary, the current move by the US may restore balance.",Let me be clear.  I'm not suggesting that the United States government take a position on ethnic Russians in Ukraine.  I simply think it makes sense for people to live where they feel most comfortable. Will it happen?  Nyet.  Because the current situation has nothing to do with what Ukrainians of either Russian or Ukrainian descent want.  It is about Putin's using and fomenting anti-Ukrainian sentiment among ethnic Russians in Ukraine to expand his own territorial hegemony.,"Why has no one questioned the legitimacy of Putin's call for peace talks with Ukraine concerning Ukrainian territory?  It's as if some one broke into your house, and then said that you should have a dialogue with them about which rooms would now be theirs and which rooms you would be permitted to keep.

It's a question of what the leaders of the NATO nations are prepared to do about it.,"You're naive if you think anyone is 'falling for' Putin's outrageous statements.  It's just that no one wants to take (military) action against Russia.  Putin's actions resemble those of Saddam Hussein, when he invaded Kuwait.  The difference is that Putin is in possession of many nukes.","I think we can all agree that Assad is a creep.

Casual Observer,,,,Putin does not care that the whole world can tell that he's lying. He seems certain that no effective means exists to stop him as long as he continues to represent what is happening in Ukraine as an internal manner because it offers an excuse for the EU and others to risk unpleasant actions like serious sanctions or military intervention to check the Russian movements. He seems to have anticipated his opportunities well but the result will be a world in which any nation that cannot stop encroachments by neighboring states is vulnerable to losing sovereignty and freedom.,"Putin is using naked force to achieve goals not in the interest of Ukraine nor of any other country and it effectively eliminates peaceful methods of settling disputes between sovereign nations. It renders the U.N., NATO, and every treaty negotiated since World War II, tenuous at best, impotent more likely. When faced with such viciousness in foreign affairs, the community of nations which prefers peaceful relations is obliged to use any means necessary to stop Putin and to prevent his further efforts by these means. ..When dealing with a bully it is essential not to avoid confrontations because doing so only encourages more or worse behavior.  The bullies underneath feel vulnerable and will retreat before anyone who can oppose them.",Sad to say it but the American intelligence community once again was surprised by what Putin has been planning for a long time...The culture in our country's intelligence community of making history rather than appreciating the world as it is once again has left us unprepared.,Russia is the biggest failed state in the world. Making it bigger will not fix anything but that seems to be what Putin would like to think...The people of the Crimea are about to become serfs for the oligarchs who control Russia with Putin. Happy trails.,"Putin seems to think that holding land mass affords power to Russia. The land provides commodities and distance over which invaders become overextended and eventually exhausted in Russian history. In terms of industrial development and trading, it's not really helped. ..Holding the Crimea assures Russia of being able to continue to use the warm water port there for international trade in case they come into conflict with the Ukraine. But in the absence of foreign affairs related to war and threats of war, it's existing arrange with the Ukraine served Russia's needs adequately. ..Putin is thinking of foreign policy in terms of power balancing rather than in terms of global economic trade and of internal industrial growth and development. There is a good reason for this although I doubt Putin gets it. The domination of the country's economy by an oligarchy of people who have no sense of sharing a country with the people of Russia means that they will only do what serves them personally in the short run, basically dooming Russia to no surplus wealth with which the country to use to build a future for everyone, and nothing with which to sustain a modern superpower.","It seems likely that Putin planned all this over a year before it all started and anticipated all the moves against him that were likely to be taken in advance. He was prepared and that is why he has not retreated, so far. To stop him means doing what he is not prepared to confront, it means taking drastic action to bring down the Russian economy by simply ending all international trade and financial transactions with the rest of the world until Russia begins to be nice.",These kind of dicey situations can lead to general wars and more damage to all than the clever people who initiate them intend. Putin is clever but he's an intellectual midget. He has no vision beyond manipulating the oligarchs and Russian people to see him as the man on horse back.,"Putin sees himself as in charge of what is happening in the Ukraine because nobody is willing to actually take the risks needed to check Russia's belligerency. The generations who confronted diplomacy with Hitler and Stalin have long since passed away, and the leaders today just cannot believe that the same anti-life and will to power mentality of those dictators could be dominating Putin's mind. ..If Europe and America acted to take down the Russian economy as quickly and thoroughly as possible, Putin would be checked and he would stop. Then the NATO forces must establish the capability to strike decisively at any invasions of countries bordering Russia at a moment's notice to deter anymore of this bad behavior.","Russia with it's huge population (and the huge number of creative and intelligent people that that provides), vast resources, strategic location and with it's previous imperial rivals all gone and able to operate in the post world war II arrangement that assures all countries do not need to fear bigger ones gobbling them up has done a poor job of developing it's potentials. Putin has seized the Crimea but without the ability to sell more than oil and a few kinds of weapons systems it will not help the economy of Russia nor enable industrial development to finally enable that country to modernize and achieve it's potential. It's bad government and an economy strangled by crooks and self absorbed oligarchs that's the core of the problem -- and Putin's pathetic inability to understand that liberal democracy not autocracy supported by fear is best way forward.",Putin is using the same reasoning as was Hitler when he claimed the German speaking parts of Czechoslovakia should be annexed to Germany. I think that the world had better stand up to Putin or accept that pre-World War II power politics is now the status quo.
Ian stuart,,,,"Putin has never acknowledged the obvious presence of Russian forces and weapons in eastern Ukraine. He has repeatedly lied about it, not just not acknowledged. The NYT insists upon reporting Putin's statements and agreements as if they can be believed. People like Merkel are not stupid. They know that the chances are slim to none that Putin can be trusted but when, inevitably, he breaks his word it will be easier to introduce tougher sanctions, including excluding Russia from the international payments system. Perhaps the next stage should be to seize all the condos that Russian oligarchs have recently purchased in NY?","Why does the NYT insist upon referring to them as Russian backed forces? Just because Putin lies and denies that Russian troops are actually fighting there is no reason why we should oblige him. Russian military are not just supporting the rebels but operating tanks, artillery, missiles and radar (it was always obvious that the rebels could not have shot down the Malaysian Airlines flight on their own).  At a minimum  the US and Nato allies should respond by providing anti tank shoulder launched missiles and counter artillery radar.",He is a loose cannon but he served in the FSB until 2013. The NYT is being incredibly naive if it accepts his assertion that he is no longer taking orders from Putin. When so called independent militias are dressed in Russian military clothing and carrying modern Russian weapons it is disingenuous in the extreme to believe their protestations of having no direct links with the Putin administration.,"There seems to be a collective myopia where Putin's power and ability to survive is concerned. He is NOT a democrat and he retains close control over the levers of power in the form of the military and the security services. He is not going to allow himself to be voted out of office. If necessary he will undoubtedly take the gloves off and seize direct control. All of the analysis couched in terms of popularity is missing the point. As an aside, it is interesting to see how organised the comments in support of him are and where they seem to come from whenever he is criticised.","Putin wasted 50 billion on the Sochi games, he doesn't CARE what it costs to destabilise the Ukraine. The killing of at least thirty Ukrainian soldiers by so called militias using Grad rockets (which would never have been available without Russian military assistance) suggests that the NYT is being disingenuous if it believes that he has truly changed his longer term objectives","Interesting to note that Putin's trolls seem to be out in force in the comments. As for arguments that Putin is concerned about his popularity: he controls the internal security forces and the armed forces, he has about as much concern for his popularity as Stalin did.","All the discussion of Putin's domestic popularity seems to miss the point. He is not a politician he is a soviet era apparatchik who controls both the military and internal security. He likes to be popular but he doesn't need it and the oligarchs are firmly under his control. Not vice versa. You have to remember that he was a second rate KGB officer in an East German backwater when the Soviet Union fell apart. That formed him and that is, in many ways, who he still is. Don't expect rationality or any concern for the people's welfare.","Russia should be treated like Iran. Block all deposits, cut off all trade, seize all assets to compensate passengers' families. It is clear that Putin considers the West to be idiots who will believe whatever he claims. The shooting down of a civilian airliner was conducted by militias headed by a Russian ex colonel in the FSB using a Russian missile battery that has been shipped back to Russia. How many more smoking guns do you want.",,

That is a huge advantage which Putin has consistently exploited throughout his career. ..The RF's great advantage is Putin's ability to accurately and realistically asses the facts on the ground and take full advantage of the situation without over-reaching...In the present case, the Crimea belonged to Russia the moment on February 22 when the Ukrainian nationalists favored by the US, the EU and NATO tore up the agreement and forced Yanukoyich to flee without formally abdicating.  That made the transition a coup rather than an abdication or an impeachment and allowed the semi-autonomous government in the Crimea to hold a vote on whether to remain with the Ukraine under the conditions of the 1991 constitution or to secede and seek to join the RF...It is profitable to compare Vladimir Putin with Otto von Bismarck.  All other historical comparisons are either ignorant or just silly.","Putin is already speaking of Ukraine as a Soviet territory.

Christian,,,,"Putin is playing the politics of distraction from the home crowd. Putin looked the fool when Yanukovich was ousted. Rather than the Russian people asking Who lost Ukraine?, they are now are chanting Crimea is ours again!","The situation in Ukraine is a great opportunity for the United States and the West to torment Putin, and the Russians who back him. All the US needs to do is pour weapons and money into Kiev. The Russians will have to respond. The Russian economy is as tiny as Putin is short. If Obama were not so bad at geopolitics, this one would be easy. The US should just sit back and give huge amounts of weapons and money to Kiev. Ukraine would soon become a serious problem for Putin while not really mattering to the US at all.","Broadside: The Russian leadership has beeen premitted for years to pursue an expanionist and irridentist policy without any cost whatsoever to Russia. I propose to increase the costs. Santions are one way to increase the costs of a terrible policy, and santions should be increased. However, direct aid to Kiev will dramatically increase the costs to Russia. Now, your statement is clearly incorrect. Our messes were usually the result of either overreacting with miliary adventurism (Iraq, Vietnam), or direct intervention with covert operations (Mossedeq, Diem assasinatons), or not reacting soon enough (Bosnia, Rawanda, al Qaeda). The policy I propose is not the same as those policies which did lead to unfavorable outcomes.  Mark my word: the United States will at some point adopt the policy I propose, and only then will we see Putin look for a dignified way to discontinue his policy as it will no longer be fun for him and the Russians to pick on their neighbors.","Putin hates the United States and tried to convince the Chinese to partner with them to saturate the markets in 2008 with Goverment owned Bonds which may not have did in the United States economy but would have made a bad economic situation much worse back then. Putin is bad no matter what angle you look at him, of course I do not want him to be assinated, but him gone would only help the Russians not hurt them. Putin is a Communist of a different sort but at the end of the day still a commy and a KGB loyalist. Putin has had Journalist killed for bad press and will kill more people in the future. He's Johnny clean hands at the end of the day because he washes the blood off his hands way before the journalist is even known missing. Putin is the root of all evil in Russia and needs to leave so Russia can become the great country it can be.","So while Hitler was signing agreements with Britain and France, he was preparing his people for war and the reclaiming of territories that were historically German. There is no guarantee that Putin will stop at the Ukraine. The Baltic states (NATO members) and my own country, Finland, have been historically Russian. Who knows what his end game is? I'm not sure anyone knows, but it's not peace, progress, or establishing a model democracy to, say, counter the American version that is slipping into the hands of oligarchs. And unfortunately, war is a game that doesn't demand two willing participants - one aggressor is enough.","I don't understand why people believe that in order to stabilize the military situation in Syria, Russia would need to make a long term commitment to having boots on the ground. If you assume that Putin wants to rebuild the Syrian government and to eradicate jihadist elements in the country entirely, then sure, a 4-month entryexit plan would be impossible. A longer commitment would have to be made to occupy the country, to suppress any and all resistance to the Assad regime, and to sort dissidents from within the local civilian populations into which they would undoubtedly blend to live to fight another day...But if the scope of Putin's goal is restricted to say, effectively eradicating the infrastructure and the organized fighting capabilities of the major dissident factions, then a short-term war could easily achieve those results. ..I think people forget that part of the reason the United States became mired in Iraq and Afghanistan was that the overarching goal of the Bush administration--beyond defeating the Taliban and toppling Saddam Hussein--was to spread democracy to the middle east. Essentially the United States took upon itself the doomed projects of building governments from the ground up and, in the words of Ken Jowit, of changing people whose loyalties are to their little kin and clan into the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence. ..The point is, Putin's goals are more restricted in scope and could be achieved with a short war.","I agree with your sentiment, but in any ways, Ukraine is already a bi-lingual state. Putin is not interested in liberal solutions to this problem, and all Ukrainians, both Russophone and in western Ukraine, have been terribly served by the governments in Kiev. I know that recommendations for a Canadian style model were emphatically made to the several Ukrainian ministries at the time of the adoption of the Ukrainian constitution. Such a solution was partially implemented in the Baltic states with some success. Rather than litigate the past, all sides should focus on the rights of all citizens in Ukraine. The only solution of competing claims over territory is a constitutional democratic solution that gives all citizens rights. If that were happening in Ukraine, we would not be where we are and neither Putin nor former Ukrainian governments were interested in that strategy.","I don't understand why people believe that in order to stabilize the military situation in Syria, Russia would need to make a long term commitment to having boots on the ground.

A longer commitment would have to be made to occupy the country, to suppress any and all resistance to the Assad regime, and to sort dissidents from within the local civilian populations into which they would undoubtedly blend to live to fight another day...But if the scope of Putin's goal is restricted to say, effectively eradicating the infrastructure and the organized fighting capabilities of the major dissident factions, then a short-term war could easily achieve those results. ..I think people forget that part of the reason the United States became mired in Iraq and Afghanistan was that the overarching goal of the Bush administration--beyond defeating the Taliban and toppling Saddam Hussein--was to spread democracy to the middle east. Essentially the United States took upon itself the doomed projects of building governments from the ground up and, in the words of Ken Jowit, of changing people whose loyalties are to their little kin and clan into the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence. ..The point is, Putin's goals are more restricted in scope and could be achieved with a short war.",,

RB,,,,"Putin is willing to keep Assad in power to bolster his interest in the Middle East. He will assist with the removal of ISIS but not his staunchest ally.  A broad Coalition should be involved in destroying ISIS and subsequently removing the Assad regime. A huge task with Putin arming the Assad regime and  further cementing his relations. This is a a quagmire that the Obama administration did not create. It is disingenuous to blame President Obama for the rise of ISIS  in Iraq and subsequently in Syria and Assad Killing of his own people. Under no conditions the United States should have started another war with Syria. ..After the war in Iraq was over, the Iraqis  did not want the US to establish a long presence in their country.  A transitional Government under Mr. Nouri al-Maliki was established.  The Iraqi Government Created ISIS with its own internal strifes.","As a politician who understands power well, Putin has a simple plan in Syria.  First, he intends to establish Russia as a major player in the region.  This makes him look strong and provides an added benefit of keeping an eye on any possibility that an Islamic movement heads north into his neighborhood.   Of greater interest to him, however, is being in the center of the turmoil in Syria and surrounding countries.  This is important to him because it gives him the chance to influence how the turmoil plays out.   Why would he care about that?  Very simple.  The turmoil is causing great migrant flows to Europe which is leading to instability in various places there and perhaps soon in some of the more well off places in Europe.  He loves instability in his neighbors, especially if he can maneuver to make it look like he might be able to stem the flow.   This gives him leverage over Europe and at the same time makes Europe more dependent on him and less on the US.   He could hardly ask for better circumstances.  Of course, Mr. Obama, as clueless as always, seems to think the US and Russia share some mutual interest in eliminating ISIS in Syria.   Nothing could be further from the truth.  Putin relishes the turmoil and the resulting pressure it puts on Europe.","I bet we will see many commenters taking credit for the sanctions imposed by the US.  It's always about how strong we are, how we know how to win, how good we are at accomplishing things.  Whereas Putin has been saying all along that it is a homegrown movement in reaction to the revolution in Kiev.",What can be done by the way of sanctions against Russia? The answer is very little. The European Union heavily depend on Russia for its source of energy.  The list of energy giants such as Gazprom and Rosneft will not be included in sanctions against Russia. Sadly President Obama and other world leaders vociferous reactions will amount to naught. Putin knows this and will continue his blatant aggression for many years to come.,Prokhanov and Dugin have an archaic worldview. The society they envision will become self-limiting by isolationism and will not be economically viable. Putin would be a fool to take their advice.,,,,,
Uziel,,,,"Despite US governmentmedia propaganda, President Putin is not up to grab land from neighboring countries a la Adolf Hitler. ..President Putin, like everybody else, was caught flat footed by a Ukrainian crisis getting out of control. The deescalation of the crisis is surely welcome by Germany and other EU member countries. ..Putin's action removing troops from the Ukrainian border is the first step in the right direction since the crisis exploded at Maidan Square in Kiev. The ball is now in Washington court to play, hopefully, a positive role.","Germany is a key country to watch from now on. The Obama administration will do whatever sanctions it can to punish Russia. The question mark for President Putin is not Washington talk but Berlin deeds. ..Chancellor Merkel faces a difficult foreign policy dilemma. As leader of the EU, she needs to keep relations with Washington on the best terms possible. Russia's energy supplies, however, are badly needed to keep Germany's economy growing. Russian natural gas plays a key role in replacing nuclear based generation in the next few years...To find out whether Russia becomes isolated globally, as the NYT says, watch Berlin. My bet is that Chancellor Merkel's decision making process will be determined by Germany's long term national and economic security needs. After all, Berlin and not Washington DC has to live in Russia's neighborhood.","Tom Friedman dixit  I opposed NATO expansion because I believed that there are few global problems that we can solve without the help of Russia.  By expanding NATO at the end of the Cold War, when Russia was weak, we helped to CULTIVATE a politics there that would one day be very receptive to Putins message that the West is ganging up on Russia.  ..No kidding, Tom! the statement above deserves some thinking. ..Foreign policy decisions made by American Presidents with negative impact overseas are OK with Mr. Friedman. In fact, no president is referred in derogatory terms even those making gross mistakes. The only exception, of course, is  W. because of Iraq's failed invasion. ..However, President Putin is called  a first-class jerk and thug because he defends effectively his country's homeland security and economictrade interests. Sort of reverse logic applied by President Reagan to 'freedom fighters' in Afghanistan and Nicaragua during the 80s.","Ukraine, certainly, cannot be 'nvaded' by 200 unarmed humanitarian aid trucks.  Kiev's refusal to deliver humanitarian aid will only deepen the conflict. ..From a psychological warfare standpoint, President Putin is preparing Russian public opinion for further escalation of the conflict. ..One thing for sure.

The question today is whether Western European allies, led by a new assertive Germany, will play ball with Washington. At this juncture, Berlin is more worried about solving the euro zone debt crisis than Putin reclaiming Crimea. ..Besides, the last thing Berlin wants to talk about is Ukraine nation building in the wake of Greece almost destroying the common currency project. Germany paying the economic costs associated with Washington imposed financial sanctions against Russia won't help, either.","The Ukrainian conflict  -- answered with economicfinancial sanctions against Moscow by Washington -- may have unintended consequences not necessarily negative for Russia. Putin's strategy to deal with such delicate situation has been impeccable so far...The conflict has strengthened Putin's grip on key sectors of the economy, controlled by the so called oligarchs.

WimR,,,,The most shocking thing I have encountered in European politics in my entire lifetime was seeing EU and US politicians on the Maidan in Kiev encouraging protesters. It was a blatant violation of one of the most basic fundaments of international law: non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Such behavior has serious consequences and it is very cheap to blame Putin for them...The article claims that Mr. Putins aggression so far has ensured European unity. That is not true. It was brutal badgering by Ms. Nuland and other US diplomats that did the job. The US is treating Europe like a colony...It should be noted that the 50 billion verdict in the Yukos case still is under appeal and that in a prior case for the European Court of Human Rights the judge had largely sided with Russia...Blaming Russia for the failure of Minsk-2 is simply wrong. Minsk-2 was killed by Kiev when it decided that it would only grant autonomy to the Donbass after there had been elections there under its supervision. Kiev also keeps increasing its blockade against Donbass - in violation of Minsk-2. And although there is a lot of propaganda in which each side blames the other for truce violations it is clear that Kiev is far from within sins in this respect.,Should Putin tell the world who murdered 298 people on the Malaysian airline?..Really? What about the US that doesn't want to disclose any of the information that it has?: satellite data and also radar images. There were American ships active in the Black Sea at the moment of the disaster who must have recorded things. And what about the Ukrainian government that doesn't want to disclose its radar images and the talks of the cockpit with the control tower?..In fact Russia has gone farthest in disclosing the information it has. So some suspicion about what the US and Kiev are hiding is certainly justified.,This is not about Europe's weakest links. Even France and Germany abhor the aggressive maneuvering of the US in Ukraine. They just are intimidated by US diplomats to stay in line. So Putin is preaching his gospel to an open audience.,"The Minsk Agreement foresaw autonomy for Donbass. Unfortunately the Ukrainian government ignored all parts of the agreement except for the one that foresaw renewed government control over the whole border. In the way the government interpreted this this would allow them to isolate the rebels from Russia. Given that Ukraine did nothing to give them autonomy the rebels predictably feared that the government saw the agreement just as an opportunity to crush them...The main fight at the moment - the airport and Debaltsevo - are about the rebels protecting themselves and their citizens from regular attacks and shellings. Things may change in the future, but for the moment the rebel operations have a defensive goal. As such the complaints in the article about Putin's aggression are not justified.",From the Russian point of view it is the Obama administration that is making dangerous nuclear moves. Both its greatly increased investment in nuclear arms and its extensive anti-missile program suggest that this administration genuinely believes that the US can win a nuclear war...What the Russian ambassador in Denmark said was not more than laying out the facts: If you choose to play a part in a nuclear war - even if it is an defensive one - you become a legitimate target...NATO has an agreement with Russia that limits its military presence in the Baltics. Recently we see NATO increasingly testing the limits of that agreement...What Putin said in the Crimea documentary was that he took into consideration the possibility that Western armies might jump into the conflict. If that would have happened he might have brought his nuclear arms into a state of alert. Would anyone have expected otherwise?,"Reports during the events suggested that Russia's policy was improvised. That they only pushed for annexation of Crimea when they were sure that there was enough popular support. And that for similar reasons they did not press for annexation of Donetsk...Having read the English translation at Kyiv Post (<a hrefhttp:www.kyivpost.comcontentukraineroadmap-for-annexing-eastern-ukraine-leaked-from-putins-office-381811.html) titlehttp:www.kyivpost.comcontentukraineroadmap-for-annexing-eastern-ukraine-leaked-from-putins-office-381811.html) targetblank>http:www.kyivpost.comcontentukraineroadmap-for-annexing-eastern-ukr...<a> it looks like a rather shallow document. Not only is NATO expansion never mentioned, but the there is also no mentioning of the anti-Russian sentiments on the Maidan. Neither is there an evaluation how grabbing East Ukraine will work out on the rest of the Ukraine and its relationship with Russia. The whole document is focused on grabbing Ukrainian territory...Is it fake? I am not sure. Its alleged author, the Russian oligarch Malofeev, was an early supporter of Strelkov and the uprising in East Ukraine. He might have this kind of ideas. But it certainly isn't the way Putin and most of his staff thinks. Their considerations are much broader.","When in 1945 Japan surrendered the US kept the emperror in place - fearing that his removal might lead to chaos. Similarly in Germany the US did only a very superficial cleansing of Nazi government officials. When the US toppled Saddam in 2003 there were many in the US government apparatus who favored a similar policy, but they didn't prevail. Despite the abysmal failure of America's Iraq intervention nobody was fired and the US pursued similar policies in Libya and Syria. It seems that the only lesson Obama learned from Iraq was that he should work through proxies so that he can't be held responsible...Looking back it is clear that the US policies in Germany and Japan were a success and that its Iraq policy was a failure. So I am rather puzzled why the article tries to analyze Putin's motives for advocating policies that are proven to be successful. It would be better to analyze the motives of the US government to keeping pushing revolutions that are well known to seriously harm the countries involved.","Whether the peace talks succeed depends to a large extent on Obama's goal. Does he want peace in Ukraine or does he want to teach Putin a lesson that aggression doesn't pay? In the latter case he will insist on harsher demands and it is much more likely that Russia and the rebels will refuse...Opinion polls show that the great majority of the Ukrainian want an end to the anti-terror operation of their government (<a hrefhttp:vesti-ukr.comdonbass83196-bolee-70-ukraincev-hotjat-okonchanija-ato) titlehttp:vesti-ukr.comdonbass83196-bolee-70-ukraincev-hotjat-okonchanija-ato) targetblank>http:vesti-ukr.comdonbass83196-bolee-70-ukraincev-hotjat-okonchanija...<a>. However, in the government anti-Russian sentiment prevails. They are very unlikely to agree to a peace agreement that the US doesn't support.",Putin is denying his involvement for the same reasons Obama denied helping the rebels in Syria: it gives him more flexibility. Voters and the rest of the world are less likely to see it as his failure if the rebels fail and that makes it easier to drop the support if a good solution is offered.,Opinion polls both before and after the 23 february showed that only around 50 of the Ukrainian population supported the Maidan revolution while about an equal number opposed it. This number is much too low to justify the overthrow of a president - in a way that included many undemocratic elements. Given the evident involvement of the US - see the leaked Nuland-Pyatt conversation - Putin has good reasons to talk about a US sponsored coup...Since then Ukraine has effectively stopped to be a democracy. After mass arrests in Kharkov and mass murder in Odessa the opposition knows that it has no choice beyond lying low. Elections are a joke when candidates and those elected are regularly threatened and beaten up...Putin knows that his regime is next on the agenda of the regime change bureaucracy in Washington. So he doing all he can to stop what he sees as their destructive aggression.
Carl Ian Schwartz,,,,Trusting Putin is a mistake; Putin wants to get a naval base in Greece and move it out of NATO--and will say anything to do it. He knows his navy's days in Syria are numbered.,"It's interesting to see so many Kremlin bots posting comments here. They don't use their last names, or they use pseudonyms..What Putin is trying to do in Ukraine is exactly what Hitler &amp; Co. were doing in Austria and Czechoslovakia from 1934-38..Sadly, many Americans are totally ignorant of European twentieth-century history. Some simply forgot what they learned in school. Others never learned it. The survivors of the World War II era--both the troops, civilians, and survivors of aggression or genocide, are dying off, so that part of oral history is gone with the wind. This is why Americans did not see that the linking of 911 (which COULD VERY WELL HAVE BEEN AVOIDED--since there were over eight months of solid warnings ignored by Condi Rice, either through stupidity, incompetence, or orders from Cheney) to attacking Iraq (which had nothing to do with it) paralleled  German history from 1933 (Reichstag Fire) through 1939 (invasion of Poland based on lies) and 1941 (invasion of former ally in attack on Poland, USSR, to seize its resources)..It is only in worlds gone blind through ignorance and propaganda posing as news that Putin can get away with what he does, just as Cheney and Rumsfeld and (yes!) Jeb Bush, participants all in the Project for the New American Century, avoided prosecution for war crimes at The Hague.","Now what is Putin going to say to Merkel about returning the seized European observers, including the German one. If he wants to copy Hitler's playbook, this would be a cinch.","Government within a government...isn't that what the Schtzstaffel (SS) was?..The comparisons with Hitler are well-founded, especially in light of this morning's news that Putin is seeking a land bridge to supply the Crimea directly and not through the Black Sea. This is redolent of the Polish Corridor of 1919-1939. With the reestablishment of an independent Poland with the Treaty of Versailles out of areas annexed by Prussia, Austria, and Russia, Poland still needed access to the sea--hence the Polish Corridor of Gdynia (now Gdansk--after Polish borders moved westward after 1945), a new port carved out of the same tranche of land that included the old German Baltic port of Danzig. This, the ethnic German identity of this area and then-western Poland, and a faked Polish attack on a German radio station, were all used by Hitler as justifications for attacking Poland on September 1, 1939...William Shirer, the CBS Berlin correspondent at the time, noted in his Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (1960) that if Germany failed to start an aggressive war by 1943, its armaments would prove obsolete and its economy would have collapsed...The same seems to be Putin's model in Ukraine and the Baltic States (which were independent until their 1939 annexation by the U.S.S.R. under Stalin)......plus a change, plus a reste la mme chose...","It is perhaps instructive to reread William L. Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich at this point in time. I distinctly recall his analysis that, if Germany did not begin World War II by 1943, its weapons would be obsolete and its economy would collapse. That's the position Putin is in now, with his economy collapsing and his weapons systems aging.","What Putin and his stooges stirred up in Crimea and are stirring up in the Ukraine is a replay of the German playbook of 1938 in Austria (leading to Anschluss) and in Czechoslovakia (leading to the Munich Pact). Like all narcissistic megalomaniacs of yore, Putin will end up going too far...and going up against the rest of the world..President Bush appears to have played right into Putin's hands, and one can only wonder where the money came from that Cheney, et al., used for the Project for the New American Century, which developed our Iraq strategy. It wasn't just the oil industry that would have benefited had Iraq been successful, but the bust it turned out to be profited Iran and any other nation whose interests are against those of the United States.","After reading this labyrinthine scheme by the soi-dise smartest persons in the room, Putin &amp; Co.,  I'm reminded of our own over-reaching smartest persons in the room, the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) gang, including Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and Jeb Bush. That organization's position papers basically set out the Iraq War to bring democracy, and premised it on a Pearl Harbor-like event on the U.S. homeland. Once the 2000 election was manipulated in Florida by Jeb Bush (governor then) and Katherine Harris (Florida's secretary of state) and orchestrated demonstrators bussed in from other states, and decided by the Supreme Court, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and their allies dominated the new administration and ensured that 911 occurred by discounting any intelligence..We saw what happened. We're still paying down its damages to our economy, not to mention trying to recover our national reputation..Unfortunately, the protagonists haven't paid any price for it, but are getting pensions from U.S. taxpayers instead of trial for treason and war crimes.","Putin himself is to blame for his delusions of grandeur. It reminds me of the accounts of life in the Fhrerbunker in March-May 1945, which held on to its delusions and then blamed the German people for their own downfall..Putin and previous Soviet and non-Soviet governments can be blamed for many problems in the former USSR, including, most chillingly, problems with the transport and distribution system. Most long-distance transportation of foodstuffs is by rail, and the rail network appears sparse at best. Road infrastructure is subpar outside of the cities, and bad driving has been the subject of a number of YouTubes..Russia was once the granary of Europe, with wheat going down the Volga and out to the Mediterranean to supply the pasta mills of Italy in the 19th Century..But without improved domestic infrastructure and packing of fresh goods to either freeze or preserve them, empty shelves in supermarkets will become the rule in Putin's Russia.","The U.S. and NATO should sit back and let Putin play this one out alone. Our reaction to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan gave rise to the Taliban as freedom fighters, and the CheneyBush policy on the Middle East still has not fully boomeranged on the United States, as Germany's invasion of the USSR win 1941 (which it copied) did within two years.",I agree that military action against Russia would serve Putin the best. This brings into question the patriotism of those on our political right that suggest it; they're the same people who were the biggest proponents of our attack on Iraq and tried to link it to 911..I get the feeling that those patriots may have had financial backing from Putin &amp; Co. in the form of laundered donations to right-wing (and taxpayer-subsidized) think tanks. The give-away--Putin's making nice with Idiot Boy and promising him a place to berth his yacht for the Sochi Olympics.

One is that Russian intervention will prolong the war. it could just as well shorten it, by providing an advantage to the Assad faction. It is hard to know.

By way of contrast, Egypt, in which the authorities reasserted themselves, is basically stable...Another is that Putin's motives here are entirely political.

It is Russia that is invading another country, not NATO, and in one thing you're half right -- Putin is a lunatic to start invading countries in an age of nuclear weapons...As to the Ukrainians, they got tired of living in an impoverished, Russian-style kleptocracy. Putin is like the bully whom everybody avoids. The more he lashes out, the more everybody hates him. He lost Ukraine and the other countries of the SovietRussian Empire because no one wants to be under the Russian thumb...Finally, regarding NATO, events have demonstrated just how wise we were to expand it. Otherwise, how long would it be before Putin decided to invade them?","It's hard to have an army without being a target. Harder not to have an army and be invaded by Russia. Therefore, we have the bases and you can be sure, given Putin's actions and stated desire to reassemble the Soviet Empire, that those countries are damn glad to have those bases there.","If Putin invades a NATO country it will be war. I doubt that even he is stupid enough to do so. Ukraine, unfortunately, is not part of NATO and as such we will not risk a nuclear war over it. Just the way the game is played, as it was during the cold war.","He will likely stop when the Europeans feel threatened and angry enough to impose significant sanctions. The Russian economy is dependent on energy sales to the West and I doubt very much that Putin would risk destroying it, and quite possibly his own hold on power. But Europe is also heavily dependent on those Russian energy supplies. The cost would be much greater to Russia, but that doesn't mean the Europeans are willing to make this sacrifice. So basically we have a game of chicken: Putin will push untilunless it becomes too costly for him to do so.",Peter the Great meets Putin the Puny.,Putin's negotiations  you give us your country or we invade. This way at least Putin has to pay a price.
S.N,,,,I agree with you- the meeting in Sochi was to show to the world that this is a problem in Russia's backyard and Russia will deal with it..However it does not negate the fact that this is not a problem created by Putin but rather the result of the disorderly break up of the USSR- in this case Russia overall acts as a balancing power preventing escalation of hostilities and making sure that both sides behave. It is unlikely anybody else can take up that role.,,,,,,,,,

It is the history of invasions and slaughter of the Slavic peoples for centuries by the West. I cannot blame the Russians for their current reaction.

The strategy is to let the West deal with the elected government next month full of Neo-Nazis in the Ukrainian gov't. Once the western model of democracycapitalism fails to dissolve ethnic tensions of violence and corruption, Putin will intervene. Putin will not let his people suffer from the poor decisions and cowardice of western leaders such as what happened in Rwanda."

Kiev could have announced that they were declaring a li-ligual state where Russian and Ukrainian would be taught in all schools and recognizwed as official government languages.  They should have deeded or ceded Sevastopol to Russia rather than leaseing it to them and declared Crimea a special autonomous region..While I deplore Putin's basic lack of manners and sense of decency, Ukraine has to know that geography has consequences and that it is foolish to bait the bear.","I am completely astonished at the tin eared bumble of what poses as leadership among the Ukrainians.  One simple step would be to decalre Ukraine a bi-lingual state (like Canada) that has both Ukrainian and Russian language as official languages of government, education, and signage in recognition of the cultural heritage of the populace..This simple step alone would undercut Putin's claims..Besides, the languages are so similiar as to make them virtually the same!",,,,,,

C Dunn,,,,"Ha, that's the exact same argument Khrushchev must have been using when they decided to place Nukes in Cuba.  How did that work for him?..It is said that 90 of conflicts are civil wars.  The NY Times reported on the strong likelihood that West Ukraine would go to war with East Ukraine way back in 1994--the same time the New York Times reported about how Crimea held a vote to rejoin Russia.   This conflict doesn't need Putin to continue, policy makers and pundits know this but continue to 'not notice' how their opinions make it so there is no path Putin can take to reduce the actions of the West against Russia's economy and long term interests.  Since the conflict can continue without Russia's involvement, it will and as such, there is no way Putin can demonstrate that he no longer providing any support for the civilians of E. Ukraine against the ultra nationalist paramilitary groups, the use of air power, cluster bombs, collective punishment that the new government in W. Ukraine deployed. NATO and the West can still announce there are Russian supplies and troops coming over--the burden of proof for them so far has been really low.  That means to stop the fighting Russia would have to be much more involved than signs show they are--which is what they are being punished for in the first place.  The US press has been serving the needs of US foreign policy strategy.  We the people need you to refocus on pointing out contradictions, logic loops, etc.","A recent study by NY University demonstrated that people view people from rival groups as being mindless unless they are perceived as a threat.  This sets us up to continually interpret international situations in ways that remove the awareness that entire people's are individuals actors and make their own decisions.  This is human nature but it leads to the exact situations we see--a Ukraine where people are only seen as 'Ukrainian' if they are pro-West.  ..Here we go again, the Kyrgyz edition. The people in Kirgizstan and other former Soviet States aren't adopting similar legislation due to similar history or threat perceptions, but instead because Putin has the magical ability to export legislation, etc. at will.  We better go rescue the Kyrgyz people from their inability to make their own decisions (i.e. decide to adopt attitudes and policies that benefit our security and trade needs.)..As research shows, our minds take these shortcuts so it is really in our benefit to learn how to spot it and correct for it from the start.  Less 'the people who threaten us have magical powers' type editorials please.","The NATO website hosts a document created by the US Army War College from 2000 that walks through Ukraine's tumultuous transition to an independent state-pointing out that US intelligence agencies predicted signs were pointing to the great likelihood of active combat between the East and the West.  It was outlined how US specifically adopted a strategy to try to disrupt Russia's relationship with Ukraine to make it less likely that Russia would be able to become the powerhouse the Soviet Union was on the assumption that this would make a safer world (which makes no sense, can you imagine the world being safer if Canada turned to China for defense and trade).  The document warns that overly zealous efforts to try to lock Ukraine with the West will lead Russia to respond--and that would be a mistake because it would strengthen China.  Here is the link to the document: <a hrefhttp:www.nato.intacadfellow98-00nation.pdf titlehttp:www.nato.intacadfellow98-00nation.pdf targetblank>http:www.nato.intacadfellow98-00nation.pdf<a>    ..The document points out what we've recently had demonstrated --NATO has never actually been serious about inviting Ukraine to join, their representation of interest was part of the strategy to draw Ukraine away from Russia. It sure seems like the West has 'played' Ukraine to get what it wants (the ability to use declare Russian businesses don't get the benefits of the free markets, lessen Putin's influence on the international stage and increase funding for NATO) and doing so that led Ukrainian nationalists to think their cards were better than reality dictates","Hard not to notice that the militant group considers themselves pro-Donetsk not pro Russia--hence them rejecting the deal Russia agreed to.  There's been a consistent 'not seeing' of the independent fears and needs of Eastern Ukrainian--even open insistence that Eastern Ukrainians just aren't sophisticated enough to be acting independently, so they must be being manipulated by Putin.  New York University had a brain imaging study recently that found that people do this when they are thinking of group they don't identify with--they don't see the humanity someone within a group unless that person is considered a threat.  There has been a collective inability to see Eastern Ukrainian opinions and an over-focus on Putin's opinion.  It is human nature to do this, but an aspect of human nature that makes difficult situations much harder.",,,,,,

Maria Ashot,,,,"Obama gave an excellent speech, presenting a forceful and coherent argument. Putin gave a very weak speech -- so weak, I actually found myself asking if he had had a stroke in the pat year, as his diction was unclear, his lips slurred and stumbled over some words and his tongue lisped, as if it had lost its nimbleness. I have listened to Putin's speeches (in Russian) over the course of all his years on the world's stage; this was not the old, energetic, lucid and eloquent Putin in command of facts and concepts, who writes and delivers his own material. While undoubtedly there are those who are betting the store on his tenacity &amp; ability to stay the course in Moscow, he had surprisingly little to say; his tone was petulant, smirking and defensive. The lies have never sounded so pathetic as today. Be careful if you are thinking about making some kind of bargain with this Putin: he will be good at holding forth in a rambling way at some other diplomatic talking shop -- he will not be able to deliver. Not on promises, not on pledges, not on expectations.","You are being lied to by Putin and Kadyrov, just as you were about Ukraine.

Do you actually even know who is running your country, and what their intentions are?","It is well known that some 2000 Chechen fighters, perhaps more, have played an important role in the rise of DaeshISIL. Kadyrov is the nexus. When Putin and Lavrov first interfered with Obama's and Kerry's highly worthwhile plan to unseat Assad, ISIL in Syria was one of the more extremist factions, but it was small in numbers, though brutal, and quite ineffectual. As soon as the Kremlin bosses decided to rescue Assad (as a favor between corrupt oligarchs to one of their own), ISIL began to grow, and the influx of Chechen fighters from Kadyrovland increased -- together with better arms in greater quantities. Lo and behold, after a successful rampage, ISIL 'stumbles upon' liquidity-rich bank vaults in Mosul while coincidentally leading Iraqi generals surrender vast arsenals of the finest in American weapons systems to them. Suddenly, ISIL is a considerable international threat, and the White House is driven even into closer military cooperation with Iranian armed forces (essentially now taking on an even more pro-Assad position, in a stunning near-reversal of policy and principles) as it fights to suppress ISIL without actually sending in US troops. That's what a few Kadyrovtsy can accomplish, when the strings are being pulled by unscrupulous self-serving megalomaniacs. It is time to speak more openly of the Kremlin-ISIL nexus in Grozny -- and to go after the wizard(s) behind the curtain pulling the levers that make Putin's lips move &amp; arms wave.","Putin likes to have himself portrayed acting like a member of the congregation at Orthodox Christian services, at least at Christmas and Easter. He made a big production over his visit to the notorious death camps on the Solovki Islands, where an ancient monastery became a dumping ground for the political prisoners of the state whose demise he has publicly decried as the worst catastrophe of the 20th century. So what about the 10th Commandment? Stop trying to capture more land for your criminal syndicate! The hypocrisy and essentially fraudulent posturing of the ROC (Putin's church) is exposed in this shameless brutality. Don't be so sure Hell does not exist, and you're not going to wind up there with your demented assault on your neighbors.","Sorry, Mr. Appledorf, your comment merely parrots the Kremlin lies. As an American of Russian ancestry who has met some of his closest associates repeatedly, as well as worked with prominent hierarchs of the Russian church that is now making excuses for him as a matter of priority, I, too, once thought there was a chance Putin was doing something good. But then came the peculiar decision to switch jobs with DM; the rising tide of corruption in direct proportion to a failure to deliver improved living standards, better health &amp; education to average folks. The crackdown on voices for freedom, on a moderate opposition (in tandem with support for Assad's atrocities) was the last straw. This man will go down in history as having made Russians kill Ukrainians, and Ukrainians hate Russians. His media have denounced the tearing down of the vile cult of Lenin. I no longer believe he ever told the truth, not on Chechnya, not on his religious beliefs, not on his own vast fortune &amp; ties to criminals.","Thank you, Thomas L. Friedman and the New York Times. Crisply written, incisively analyzed, astutely presented. It is still not too late for significant shifts to happen in Moscow without destabilizing the world -- but it is very much too late to attach much faith to Putin's latest protestations and attempts to reassert the Minsk 'Ceasefire' that never actually worked. He has lied so much, as you point out; he has made such foolish bets: how is he to be believed today, next week? Knowing better than we do how dire mere existence is for average Ukrainians (whose situation has for too long been worse than most Russians'), how can he claim to be opposing NATO by attacking Ukrainian lands &amp; laws? The point of the NATO-attachment concept is simply that Russia today is not in any kind of shape to be dictating conditions to anyone. Like in Ukraine today is a day-to-day thing; membership in EU or NATO is a far more distant horizon, conditional upon so much it is an utterly mendacious argument Putin adds to his lame arsenal of broken ideas. He won't back down, because he is too proud; pride blinds him into poor decisions. So now we must wait for him to go &amp; let us pray it happens cleanly, without further instability. His tactics are killing innocents; his threats to Navalny are an example of just how Stalinist he has become. That may be a shock to good folks who remember shaking his hand, but it is the Stark Truth of today. Pray for Peace. Good Health to you! Happy 2015... we hope","You are being lied to by Putin and Kadyrov, just as you were about Ukraine.

We in the States are used to seeing similar blogging efforts during heated election seasons, or on hot-button topics with implications for big business, such as climate change. Money in cyberspace will not, however, replace boots on the ground. Those boots are in evidence all over Ukraine and they are pointing West towards the EU. Being of Russian ancestry, with family who lived along all those borders during their bloodiest 20th c. ordeals, I understand all the arguments. I was not for the 2004 Bush-era protests (although I sympathized with the aggrieved). 2013 is a completely different story. The simple fact is Putin has failed to deliver. Stark data reveal Ukrainians have gained nothing since 1991. The Donetsk stakhanovites can't see they'd be better off with upgraded industrial infrastructure, better working conditions &amp; investments? That's brainwashing. The Kremlin media &amp; corrupt organization bosses are very good at maintaining the brainwashing in their intimidated subordinates. But at the end of the day we all need food, shelter &amp; a future for our kids. Putin's politics only deliver for a tiny elite, much less than one-tenth of 1 of former Soviet passport holders are prospering today.It is a disgraceful fact that signals this event is not going to dissipate on command. A civil war in Ukraine will help no one, least of all Putin. Let them go.","When Putin began his war on Ukraine, initially with a degree of subtlety, then abruptly annexing Crimea, killing unarmed Ukrainian soldiers who had been promised safe passage, then arming 'local volunteers' before finally sending in convoys of supplies and professional Russian military -- while lying all the time -- many of us shrugged this off as some kind of 'understandable' reaction to the Ukrainians' desire to escape Moscow's domination. It was said that the history of Russian-Ukrainian relations was 'murky'; that these 'provincial Slavic squabbles' were not worth ruining business over; that Russia is 'too important' for the Western powers not to cut it huge amounts of slack. But because we were only somewhat firm with him, Putin has now embarked on a far bigger and more dangerous geopolitical enterprise: reshaping a terrified Middle East into anything that suits the Moscow-based kleptocracy. There is nothing philosophical about this. The implications greatly transcend whatever those who imagine allowing Assad to get his way is the 'lowest cost' solution. Because if Putin makes gains in Syria, then he will quickly pick another target. The likeliest next area of aggressive expansion will be in Europe -- but others cannot be ruled out. Don't delude yourselves: this is a huge threat that challenges the complacently tolerant view of Putin we have been encouraged to have for the past 15 years or so. Russia on a rampage, dropping enormous bombs, is not good news at all."

Leonard Miller,,,,"I stopped reading Mr. Shteyngart's report on his day 1 when he observed: For most people born in the U.S.S.R., myself included, the word Crimea evokes memories of summer vacations gorging on pelmeni (a species of dumpling) and getting reacquainted with the sun in decaying hotels and private huts. Think of it as a shabbier Fort Lauderdale with the occasional Chekhov statue. In any case, the loss of Crimea, with its majority-speaking Russian population, has been one of the most acutely felt wounds of the dissolution of the Soviet Union  having Crimea fall outside of Russias borders was like cutting off a piece of the Floridian peninsula below Jacksonville....Not mentioned by him is that Crimea is the home of Russia's Black Sea Fleet and air bases.  The Black Sea provides Russia with its only warm water ports with access to the open oceans.  The possible loss of these facilities to NATO could potentially deny Russia maritime access to through the Mediterranean to southern Europe, the Suez Canal, Africa and the South Atlantic. Putin has made it clear that this is a key reason for controlling Crimea.  Russias reaction to the potential loss of control over Crimea would be at least as strong as that of the US if it thought that Panama might form a military alliance with China...By neglecting or trivializing Russia's legitimate strategic interests in his commentary, Mr. Shteyngart is stooping to the low quality of commentary he decries in the Russian media.","As you correctly said, in formulating a response to Russia we need a much more accurate perspective of where Russia and Mr. Putin are coming from.  Largely left out of our news reports and commentary is the fact that Russia has long maintained naval and aviation bases in Crimea and, more recently, a naval base in Tartus, Syria which are vital to protecting Russia's legitimate right of commercial maritime access to the Mediterranean Sea and, therefore, to Southern Europe, Africa, the Mid-Atlantic and the Suez Canal. Analogies can be made to the British military facilities in Gibraltar and the French facilities in Toulon. It is easy to understand that not only Mr. Putin but most of Russia are extremely sensitive to comments and actions of the US and the rest of NATO with regard to Crimea and Syria that might conjure up the old Cold War efforts to bottle-up Russia...In its editorials and other coverage of events in Crimea, the NY Times has done little more than make cryptic references to Russia's legitimate interests rather than give its readers a balanced explanation of some reasonable security concerns that largely may be motivating Russia.  More education and less agitation would make the NY Times coverage more credible about what underlies events in Crimea and what is at stake for all parties.","Putin's domestic policy ... seems to require adventures like Ukraine that gin up nationalism and anti-Westernism to distract the Russian public...This statement is disrespectful of much of the Russian public.  They largely are an educated people who have been welcoming Russia becoming a normal country aligned with the West.  The Russian people are strongly behind Putin now, less because he is manipulating them, but because they have seen their earnestness being rebuffed and the US government and media, especially, acing belligerently and insensitively to Russia's legitimate interests, particularly in Crimea...The important point is that in formulating our policy response and our reporting and commentary, we should look beyond just Putin and worry about losing the Russian public.","Overwhelmingly important to protecting Russia's maritime access to the Mediterranean Sea and, therefore, southern Europe, the Mid-Atlantic and the Suez Canal are Russia's naval and aviation bases in Crimea and its naval base in Tartus, Syria.   It is not hard to understand how Russia would perceive--and even be paranoid about--the combination of events in Syria and Crimea as being threats to its profoundly important, legitimate rights of maritime movement in that part of the world. ..It is not to the NY Times' credit that in criticizing Mr. Putin's dangerous tactics it merely says that  Russia has legitimate interests in the Ukraine rather than the Times explaining to its readers the full implications to Russia's vital, rightful interests. ..The surest way to gain an enemy is to treat someone that way. Any proposals by the US and other NATO countries to solve the problems in the Ukraine and Syria must involve believable assurances to Russia that it can maintain facilities to protect its maritime access to the Mediterranean Sea.","Russia maintains naval and aviation bases in Crimea and a naval base in Tartus, Syria which are vital to protecting Russia's legitimate right of maritime access to the Mediterranean Sea and, therefore, to Southern Europe, Africa, the Mid-Atlantic and the Suez Canal.

M,,,,"Calling it a grave mistake is emblematic of the Obama Administration's spineless approach to dealing with Russia. Just because you don't think Russia is where we need to be focusing our foreign policy energy, doesn't mean you should let the aggressive Putin walk all over you. For all I could criticize Bush II for, he at least convinced Russia that when he said something ominous, he'd potentially follow through on the threat. That's often more important in foreign policy than whether you actually would follow through on a threat...Obama's words ring hollow, and that's why Putin does things like give Snowden asylum and assert military prowess abutting a (former?) U.S. ally. Not to mention the fact that Obama just plainly initiated the reneging of our deal for a base in Poland, which was negotiated at irreversible geopolitical risk to that ally. All in all, he shows that in eastern Europe, it doesn't make sense to partner with America...Admittedly, part of it isn't his fault: He was elected as a president who would reduce our military engagement worldwide. Nonetheless, it would be nice if that weren't so obvious because Russia basically ignores U.S. intimations most of the time and seemingly does what it wants. I don't think that happened under Bush with Russia.","Good news: Most people are questioning this whole event and that of the still unsolved MH370.

Just because of where it happened doesn't automatically me we should assume they are responsible. I've read more about peoples personal objections of Putin these last two days than about hard facts.

Russia's only enduring product is the Advanced Kalashnikov 1947, the famed AK-47.. Abundant gas and oil only take one so far.  See for example Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Kazakstan, Venezuela.","If Vlad the Shirtless Putin is so concerned protecting Russians living in the Ukraine the solution is simple..Take them to Russia, give them jobs, housing and healthcare..No Russians living in Ukraine dreaming of Russia, no problem."
Larry Hoffman,,,,"I am sure that some of you will find my idea a little far out. But I think if we do it, Putin will finally understand that it is time to stop with the military bluster. We take a full combat Batallion and station one full Company in Latvia, Lithuania, and one in Estonia. Each backed up by a full squad of Tanks and a battary of artillary. While over in Poland or Hungary we stage a full wing of Warthogs. Let the Russians try what they did in Ukraine then!",This time I can keep it short. When it come to Mr. Putin keep your hands on your wallet. The man suffers from a Napoleon complex and seems to want to take Russia backwards to the days when the Secret Service ran the Nation,"I suggest the the United States simply tell Mr. Putin that if he continues on his path in the Ukraine that America will pull it's Ambassador from Moscow, and place Russia off limits to American Tourists, and Russian Tourists from the US.","For those of you who have managed to miss it: Putin is trying to rebuild the old Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. There is NO NEED for America to make nice with the Russians. Believe it or not Putin's threat regarding Nuclear weapons is just that a threat. Even Putin is NOT sufficiently stupid enough to start a nuclear war. But his ambitions are more than capable of starting an old fashioned ground war..So I have a suggestion. Lets make a new deal with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.  We take one American Armored Infantry Battalion, and we station ONE of it's three Companies ( unless they have changed things I recall that a battalion is made of three companies, if wrong someone please correct me:thanks) in each of the three Countries. They could train with each other and with the troops of the three hosts. This would send a CLEAR signal to the Russians to NOT try to come into the three Baltic States in order to ahem, choke, gag, save the ethnic speaking Russian residents of the three States.","I understand that Putin's got an 80 favorable rating in polls. Well, F.Y.I, even though Joe Stalin had high favorable ratings because Mother Russia was seen by the West as being STRONG!.Many of our ahem choke, gag, political experts keep telling us that Global sanctions will have no effect on Russia.  I do not have a college degree in expert BUT I do have an opinion.  The Russian economy was according to many reports, already falling down, According to more recent reports there is now a fairly large movement of capital OUT of Russia. If those reports are true and the Russian economy really tanks, TRUST ME DARLING, Vladimir and his policies will NOT be so favored by the Russian people.",If ANYONE thought that Putin was going to be of ANY assistance to the cause of peace in the Middle East you have forgotten Russia's history in the neighborhood. Least of all Russia has been for decades THE military supplier of Syria as far back as Assad's Father. Why would the Russians want anyone other than an existing customer for it's weapons to be sitting on the government of Syria?  Russia already has and wants to maintain IT''S position as the military supplier to ALL Middle Eastern Customers who are opposed to the U S of A.,"I have not checked the official records but I think that Napoleon and Putin are about the same height. I think that Putin also suffers from the same disease than Bonaparte did, i.e, Megalomania, that in the end Vladimir will end up with nothing..Just a thought","I like all the rest of us have no, actual, idea of what is in those white trucks! However, since I do NOT have a mental image of Putin riding up on his White Horse to save the day like Mighty Mouse, I'm not so sure I want to find out what they really contain..But than again, perhaps a leopard can change it's spots!",,
MeriJ,,,,"Well, hes certainly played this well...First he ensured that Ukraine remained dirt poor and that it shut down most of its military.  (Thanks, Comrade Yanukovych, for your service.)  Then he generated social disorder via special ops forces and local thugs.  All the while demanding that Kiev restore order.  However he also stationed troops on the border and threatened to invade if Kiev uses force to restore order...Now he tells Kiev they are not allowed to have any troops at all in the eastern portion of their own country...What Putin understands well is that many people in those post-Soviet nations crave the stability that comes with a strong hand. Such people look back positively on certain aspects of the Soviet era and are willing to give up some liberty to regain leaders who demonstrate that strong hand.  ..Many others, of course, are energized by the opportunities that come with change and freedom. These people tend to favor closer ties with the EU. ..Putin is appealing to the former in East Ukraine by showing them how powerless Kiev is to restore order. He demands that it be restored -- while ensuring that it cannot be.  As a result, some people are thinking, hmm, at least with Putin we will have order. ..And, of course, they are thinking he will prevail in the end, so why risk my life and livelihood by speaking out for unification...The man knows what he is doing.","&gt; But if the evidence continues to accumulate that Mr. Putin and the rebels are carving out a permanent rebel-held enclave in eastern Ukraine..Please explain at what point the evidence will accumulate sufficiently that we admit the obvious?  ..Nothing Putin says has any meaning -- other than as a possible indication that the opposite is likely true.  If he says X, I immediately examine Y.  Its been a reliable barometer for some time now.","I think Merkel is doing the best she can.  The EU is not a decisive body.  Furthermore, Putin has been funding both the far right and the far left in many of those countries to destroy any hope for consensus.  ..Merkel has to exhaust the diplomatic options, hoping that Putin will decide he's achieved his primary goals and stop there.   None of which helps Ukraine, but that's the simple reality.  Germany doesn't even have a real military any longer.  They were all caught with their pants down.",It's puzzling that we haven't followed through on our promise to impose deeper sanctions unless the Kremlin stops supporting these guys. Putin would be happy for Ukraine to remain destabilized for years...The Kremlin and its separatists appear to understand only one thing.  Everything else they perceive as weakness.  They will never back down in the face of even a hint of weakness.  Poroshenko gets that...I understand why Europe's hands are tied.   But why are we so clueless?  Why do we make threats at all if we never intend to follow through?,"Let recap the other theories of what is motivating Putin and check his scorecard thus far: ..Fear of NATO coming to his doorstep was one of the original theories. If true, we can safely say that his response has been a colossal fail. ..Forcing Ukraine to change its mind about going to the trade union prom with the other guy seemed to be a goal as well. Also a colossal fail. ..Sheering up domestic support at home was another theory, the idea being that he was nervous about potential revelations (unknown to us as yet) or economic stagnation or chaotic nationalistic fervor needing an outlet and not wanting that outlet to be focused against him. On that count, we must award him a stunning victory ... so far. ..A land bridge to Crimea would be highly practical and a more tangible outcome as well -- something he can point to with pride. However I find it odd that we are only now seeing his proxy army target cities in that corridor. So while this theory was discussed early on, as I recall, maybe it only recently jumped to the top of his list.","The Realpolitik crowd say this is about raw power.   That we should have known Russia would go primitive when we took actions over the years that Putin would perceive as threatening. ..From that perspective, Russias view is the following:  ..1. We own Ukraine and only indulged its fantasy of being a sovereign state.  ..2. Any desire by Ukraine to join the EU to improve its prosperity is a march eastward by the EU to threaten us.  ..3. Therefore, having warned everyone we will destroy Ukraine rather than allow it to make its own decisions, we can say with certainty that what is happening in Ukraine is the Wests fault. If the West hadnt encouraged democracy in Ukraine or entertained its interest in joining the EU, none of this ugliness would have occurred.  ..And all that is undoubtedly true. You could say the same of any violent bully. If a battered wife knows that her husband will harm her for seeking help, then she and any agency who responds are in some respect to blame when he reacts by beating her close to death.  ..But is that really how we want to view the world? ..Putin's Russia is a ruthless mafia gang in decline, using the proceeds from its gas reserves to appear stable while terrorizing its neighbors and its few non-compliant citizens. All this, while simultaneously whining about how misunderstood it is and telling bald-faced lies with every single breath...We cannot get overly involved in this.  But we must do something.","This is Putin's best opportunity to change course without losing face domestically.  This is an unexpected event which could change everything.  Or not...If Putin stays hard-line now, there will no hope of him turning back later..Russia has to have a face-saving path back to full citizenship in the community of leading nations. That's the balancing act for the West. Just enough pressure to motivate a change of course but leave them a path they can actually walk.","Until this week, Putin's efforts to destabilize Ukraine have been a resounding win across the board for him. All upside at virtually no cost.  ..If real sanctions escalate, that will change. Can he adjust to the changing play-board and take this opportunity to pull out? ..I have to say, I fear he is not as agile a strategist as I thought even a few months ago","It sounds to me like the plausible deniability phase is ending. Putin is opening new fronts north and south...Some call him a master strategist, but I see only a clever tactician. When I look at the long term I see economic disaster for Russia. Who will want to join his customs union now -- and how greatly will he need to compensate those who do?  ..To Putin, short-term appearances are what matter. But the long run is exceedingly harsh when it comes to exposing illusions.","Kiev stalled the convoy with every bureaucratic trick in the book. I think that's obvious.  ..At this point, Putin's goal is to get a ceasefire as quickly as possible, before both cities are lost. That's why he is travelling to Minsk next week. The separatists are on the ropes. He needs a ceasefire immediately.  ..That's why this convoy is moving today, despite the extraordinary implications. It has nothing to do with humanitarian aid. It is a cynical ploy to appear caring while in fact being just the opposite."

Harry,,,,"I tbought Putin  played chess while the west plays checkers? Now he wants to dump billions into the black hole of Greece, hilarious! Not a very smart move Vlad, can you loan Detroit a few billion while you are feeling generous?","Negotiate the split of Ukraine. There is no other way short of war. It's up to the EU and the west to prove that our way of life is superior to what Putin and his mafia offer. The countries bordering Russia need to know they won't be abandoned and assimilated. Resistance is not futile. Split the country and support the western Ukrainians, economically and militarily. It's ultimately cheaper than war.","Very good Vlad, now we can leave. Let them own this morass. Let Czar Putin spend his countries treasure and blood fighting the Sunnis with their gulf state backers.",History repeats itself over and over. Is this what Europe was like in the 1930's? Putin is following Hitlers playbook and of all people the Germans should see this.,Just as the separatists continued fighting for Debaltsve to link Luhansk and Donetsk with rail and water so too this ceasefire will not hold because Blind Freddy can see that the end game is to link Crimea via Mariupol to create a 21st Century Novorossiya.  If the EU and USA carry their position to the only logical destination then we are witnessing the germination of a massive war in Europe. That is because Putin will not tolerate a world where the West can militarily intervene globally at will in its interests but Russia must be contained. Forward into the horrific Past guys.,"Very good Vlad, now we can leave. Let them own this morass. Let Czar Putin spend his countries treasure and blood fighting the Sunnis with their gulf state backers.","Anyone who trusts Putin is a fool. Megalomaniacs only care about one thing, power. The western nations have made many mistakes, trusting Russian power brokers could be the worst mistake of all. Ask yourself this question, if we allow Putin a free hand in eastern Ukraine will he stop there. His ambitions do not end there comrades. The only thing that will stop this madness is tactical nukes stationed in every bordering country with mother Russia. Hitler would be proud of Vladimir the great.","Make no mistake, both of our countries share blame in this humanitarian fiasco. But if you seriously want me to trust a leader who kills political oponents by poisoning with polonium you are seriously delusional. Putin maybe smart and very powerful, but he is a sociopath. Please do not elevate this man to the statue of statesman or peacemaker.","We were so close to actually being allies, both economic and strategic. The west actually was fearful of a collapsing Russia being incapable of securing the tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. I remember clearly how it was in everyone's interest to keep Russia strong, to not let it collapse. Our leaders both corporate and political invested and propped up Russia. Then Putin came along and craved a dictatorship for life.  But Russians deserve freedom, they just don't know anything but an authoritarian system. The enemy is not the west, it's greed and power. Step down Vladimir, your people deserve better.","Be bold Mr President, withdraw all forces from the entire region. Let Putin own this morass that we all helped create. Let him pay for the reconstruction,rearming and all the fighting. I'm sure it will turn out just fine for the Russian people."
rice pritchard,,,,"This is pure Russophobia at its worst. The C.I.A. conspired to overthrow the elected government in Ukraine as a precursor to sabotage and subversion against Russia and the Kremlin struck back. What would the U.S. have done if Russia had overthrown the Canadian government? No President Putin is not paranoid just prescient. He has seen the One WorldNew World Order take over country after country through subversion by rigging elections and bribing politicians to further their insane schemes of total world domination by the banksters, crapitalists and fingerciers headquartered in America and Europe. He does not wish to surrender Russia's independence and sovereignty on the altar of Mammon. He does not want Russia de-industrialized, crushed with government and private dent, double digit unemployment and swamped with Third World immigrants as this criminal cabal has done to most Western nations. Putin is a patriot and loves his homeland. This must seem old fashioned and quaint to these globalist gangsters who are world citizens.","No I am an objective observer who reads and watches other media in addition to the corporatist controlled New World Order propaganda constantly spewed out by most Western tv, radio, newspapers and magazines. There are plenty of web sites and a handful of radio and tv stations and magazines that are not bought and sold by the big banks and big business who speak the truth about Western aggrandizement in Ukraine and stand against the White Collar Mafia in the West who want to take over all of Ukraine first to use as a base for sabotage and subversion and later seize Russia with is massive storehouse of mineral, metal, and agricultural riches. Putin is a patriot and does not intend to surrender or betray Russia as yet another victim on on the Globalists' altar.",It is so outrageous to say that Putin's actions upended the post Cold War Order in Europe. No two decades of steady Western encroachment against Russia starting with the globalist takeover of the Central European countries in the 1990s and installing stooges of the banks and corporations to turn their nations over to Big Business after decades of Soviet rule and encircling Russia to the north and west with hostile regimes that joined the EU and NATO is what upended what could have been a lasting peace and strong ties between the West and Russia. The Crimea is Russia's business and Russia's territory period. Putin and his predecessors showed tremendous restraint and forbearance in the face of constant Western aggrandizement. Hopefully Russia will now decide to return to economic autarky due to their huge amount of natural resources of every kind and reopen all her consumer factories so that the only imports she needs are natural rubber and a few other things easily obtainable from Asia. The Russians are an ancient and great people and will not be bullied or blackmailed by the One WorldNew World Order into submitting to their tyranny. They have always defended their country and are solidly united in this crisis. Putin has more support and popularity now than any Russian leader in history. If the West continues  this ill advised course of seeking to bend Russia to its will it will only further alienate an old ally at a time when Western civilization is in mortal danger.,"I love this One World New World order propaganda. The Globalists overthrow the elected government in Ukraine and install their own puppets with an eye to seizing Ukraine's natural resources and establishing a beachheadbase for subversion again Russia and when Russia pushes back and arms and supports Ukrainian separatists who do not want to be slaves of the NWO and their Kiev henchmen Friedman and others of his ilk cry foul and accuse Putin of being a czar, a war criminal, or a new Hitler! Oh well the day of Davos Man and the New World Order is rapidly unraveling in a thousand ways, mostly due to massive, crushing, ruinous government and corporate and private debt. The whole interconnected criminal conspiracy orchestrated by the banksters and fingerciers and crapitalists cenetered in London, New York, and Bonn is on its way out and Russia does not intend to be among its last victims before it totally collapses. President Putin will stand firm and have a buffer state in eastern Ukraine against NATO intrusion and Russia will remain sovereign and independent. Nations everywhere are waking up to the crimes against humanity being committed by these billionaire bandits and eventually there will be retribution and justice. Hopefully in courts of law in a legal, orderly and fair manner where their stolen wealth will be confiscated and the criminals sent to prison at hard labor for the remainder of their natural lives.","But Putin is not wrecking the Western world, its own internal elites have been doing that for decades,","It is clear that the Globalists in Washington and London and Brussels do not want peace because they let their hand picked puppets in Kiev put pre-conditions on the upcoming talks that there would be no autonomous state in DonbassEastern Ukraine. Therefore the fighting and dying will continue until the legitimate aspirations of the Russian Ukrainians are recognized and safeguarded and Russia's vital need for a buffer state against her enemies in the West is satisfied. This is a pity because the little people are the ones suffering and their towns destroyed while those behind it, the global elite, in the Western financial centers and capitals sit back and chortle and rub their hands in glee and greed at the prospect of first conquering and exploiting all the agricultural and mineral wealth of Ukraine and of course eventually moving on to the vast natural treasure house of Russia---which President Putin and the Russian military will never surrender. Now we hear that the Pentagon has squandered hundreds of thousands of thousands of taxpayers' dollars for phony experts to look at pictures of Putin and then declare he has asperger's syndrome. What utter nonsense! What Putin has is deep pride and patriotism and is under enormous stress and strain to keep the New World Order from swallowing Russia as it has done most of the world. He is smart and definitely a strong man. Besides if he was truly a mental case would it not behoove the US and EU to not get him stirred up?","This is all a charade. The Obama regime and Congress have no desire for a peaceful settlement in Ukraine. Their banking and corporate masters on Wall Street and the same crew of cutthroats in Europe are determined to swallow Ukraine and then Russia. Putin knows this and cannot allow such a calamity to befall Russia. If the West really wants peace all they have to do is order their puppets in Kiev to withdraw all the Ukrainian armed forces from eastern Ukraine and declare a cease fire. then convene an all party peace conference, and grant complete internal autonomy to eastern Ukraine with no government military allowed there. Next declare Ukraine a neutral country, forswear any membership in the EU or NATO, and agree to free trade with Russia. This will give Russia a buffer state between her and her globalist enemies to the West,  and all the death and destruction in Ukraine will end. Of course the Western banksters and crapitalists have no desire for peace in Ukraine. They want to use Ukraine as a stepping stone to eventually overthrow the legitimate, elected Russian government and installing their henchmen in Moscow as they have done in nearly every Western nation since World War II. Putin however is smart and a strong leader and a patriot. He is not going to turn Russia over to the tender mercies of the Western White Collar Mafia. Since Russia has a huge military and atomic weapons these billionaire bandits would do well to back out and back off of Ukraine and Russia.","It looks like the Ukrainian rabbits started a feud with the Russian Bear and now realize that their globalist masters in Western Europe and the U.S. are not going to go to war to save them! Tough! There should be a lesson here for all the big banks and big business who wanted to take Ukraine as the first step to toppling Putin and seizing Russia's natural wealth and enslave her people as they have done to most of the rest of the world. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. The Russians will tolerate almost anything from their own native rulers but they will not stand for outside control from any quarter. They will do whatever it takes and endure whatever it requires to keep Russia sovereign and independent. Going back to the Mongol Khans and Turkish sultans down through Napoleon, the Kaiser, and Hitler, invaders of Russia have learned the hard way the Russians will endure any sacrifices to keep their country strong and free of foreign control. Obama and the rest of these corporate lackeys in the Western world need to recognize this reality and stop meddling and interfering in any way, shape, form or fashion with Russia and her sphere of influencebuffer states in the Near Abroad.  Otherwise it will bring only hardship, heartache, and misery for people in those countries and economic problems for Western nations. Russia is Europe's first line of defense against the growing threats from the Orient and the Middle East. Seize the day and make friends with Russia!","Whoever wins this election is taking over a country that is a bankrupt kleptocracy and a liability in every way. Unless bottom up and top down social, economic and political reforms take place and corruption is punished with prison and confiscation of stolen fortunes, Ukraine will never prosper. Also the new government needs to settle problems with Russia at once before any real reforms can be achieved. This means recognizing Russia's annexation of the Crimea in exchange for forgiveness of all debts and a good long term price on gas and oil from Russia. Declare Ukraine neutral and put it in the Ukraine Constitution that Ukraine can never belong to the EU or NATO or sister or successor organizations, and forbid any foreign troops on her soil by law. Pass a Bill of Rights to protect minorities, including Russians, and make Russian an official language. The new president should go to Moscow and sit down and talk face to face with President Putin and hammer out a settlement that is fair and just for all and legitimately satisfies Russia's need for military and economic security. Also boot the IMF and World Bank out of Ukraine permanently. They are nothing but blood sucking white collar criminals who will bleed the Ukrainian peasantry and economy white to enrich themselves and their bankster directors . Tell Western Europe and the United States to stay completely out of  Ukraine's affairs! These few but vital reforms will hopefully bring about a renaissance in Ukraine!","Putin is in an unenviable position. The New World Order has made financial war on Russia to eliminate her as a real player in world affair so the evil axis of the U.S. U.K. and E.U can continue to loot the world with impunity. In time they want to eliminate the Putin regime either by coup or rigged elections and place their own puppet politicians in charge in Moscow as in the West and make Russia yet another victim of their crimes. Russia is a store house of natural treasures of all kinds, metal, mineral, forest, farm, etc. and the big banks and big business want to plunder this as they have done most of the the rest of the world. Of course there are measures Putin can take to contain the damage: make the ruble non-convertible and trade at a fixed rate to other currencies and institute capital controls to prevent the flight of even more capital abroad; retaliate by cyber attacks on the very financial institutions behind this campaign to humiliate and ruin the Russian economy, a complete cut off of natural gas and oil to Western Europe which would leave many Frenchmen and Germans shivering in their homes and their factories closed, default on the Russian national debt and private debts as well, and confiscate foreign owned property. As a last resort the Russian Army could simply roll over both Ukraine and the Baltic States and call NATO's bluff. If North Korea and Iran could be persuaded by Putin to move in tandem with the Russians this could mean real war not cold!"

But there is no black and white in nature, everything is pretty much gray. Samuel Johnson helped to build one of the world's most patriotic countries. Putin does the same. ..Unfortunately opposition in Russia is muted, that's true. But again, it depends on what kind of opposition we're talking about. Tea Party here is called Liberal Opposition. I'd mute some of them with pleasure, just can't bear this kind of people...And to say Russia is dark... What? You see better from N.J. I guess.

Paul A Myers,,,,"I am revising a first draft of a historical novel centered on the 1938 Munich Crisis. Significant parts of the NYT editorial are almost word-for-word out of the failed thinking of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in London and Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet in Paris in 1938. ..Unlike 1938, the Western democracies today are strong and robust while the dictator is weak and getting weaker. Putin should face increased costs and military pressure across the entire front in the Ukraine and at each step of any plan of escalation he undertakes. And there should be no talk about federation. That was the fatal flaw in Czechoslovakia in 1938 with regard to the Sudetenland Germans and it would set a terrible precedent with regard to the Baltics and other satellite states on Russia's periphery. ..Sometimes principles should be upheld in the face of intimidation.",Historical analogies rarely travel well. But the similarity of words and considerations between Hitler's demand for first the autonomy of the German-speaking regions of Czechoslovakia and then later for the full cessation of the German-speaking regions to Germany is indeed very similar to what is occurring in the Ukraine today...French prime minister Edouard Daladier correctly told prime minister Chamberlain before the crisis that Germany aimed to dismember Czechoslovakia completely and then turn on the other countries of East Europe. Something very similar seems to be going on in Vladimir Putin's mind; he wants to fatally weaken the Ukraine and then possibly pressure the Baltic Republics and other East European countries into some sort of vassalage. ..So what I would say is the historical irony here is just how strong the parallels with Czechoslovakia in 1938 truly are. It isn't fiction.,"There is a lot of excellent diagnosis in Cohen's analysis. But Cohen takes a wrong turn when he tries to wrap this into his neocon meme that Obama doesn't understand and that Putin only understands force represented by the delivery of lethal arms to the Ukraine...The sanctions are imposing real costs on Russia and will continue to do so. The hole that Putin eventually will have to climb out of is getting deeper and deeper, not shallower. ..Cohen should listen carefully to the Merkel-Obama press conference of February 9 and try to understand what was said and its import and consequences. Prudent firm western leadership is going to eventually carry the day.","To paraphrase the Taliban, Putin has the watch, the West has the time...Putin's foreign currency reserves are sand running out of the hour glass. The West can muddle along for years to come.","Re: Putin is clearly afraid of more sanctions. It is time the U.S. and E.U. imposed them...If sanctions ultimately succeed here, it a major diplomatic triumph  and important precedent.

Meanwhile President Obama has too many elephants on his plate - Syria, Egypt, the catastrophe waiting to happen - oil-shale XL Pipeline from Canada through the US to the Gulf of Mexico), the horrific inequality between the ultra-rich and the very poor in our country (akin to the situation of the Bourbons in France in 1789) and so on.  Russia's Sochi Olympic victories and Putin's grab for the  Crimea (Russia's only warm-water port to its nation) have now forced Russia onto the front burner of the US's overburdened stove.  Angela Merkel reported that Vladimir Putin seemed mad when she met with him.  A mad Russian (cf Rasputin) is nothing new over there.","What Putin Really Wants:  remember a few words of Boris Yeltsin - I refer to calls for humanitarian intervention in the affairs of another state - a new idea, this - even when they're made under the pretext of defending human rights and freedoms.  And A man must live like a great brilliant flame and burn as brightly as he can.  In the end he burns out.  But this is far better than a mean little flame.  And Mikhail Gorbachev's The Soviet people want full-blooded and unconditional democracy.   Though Vladimir Putin averred that the break up of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th Century, it was not.  As Yeltsin said let's not talk about Communism.  Communism was just an idea, just pie in the sky.","Another wrong Republican rant by Senator John McCain.  Another chance to throw mud at President Barack Obama's leadership.  Isolating Russia in the international community and NATO exercises on Ukraine's eastern frontier are ideas as corrosive and awful as President George W. Bush's incursions (read: bloody ongoing wars initiated by Republicans) in Afghanistan and Iraq.  President Obama is of a younger generation than Senator McCain, who is still spouting antediluvian, anti-Red foreign policy.  This is not the USSR of the Iron Curtain.  Vladimir Putin will rule Russia as long as he is allowed to (given the fall of Tsars, Communism and leaders from the Year Dot till the present).  President Obama's leadership of the US at present is beyond criticism of Senatorial fear-mongers and jingoists who would have the world believe that the empire of the United States is in peril (as are the Ukraine and Crimea in peril) from Russia's ethos and foreign policy and Russia's bare-chested, botoxed sabre-rattling Tsar Vladimir.",,
AmateurHistorian,,,,"If hypocrisy is a minable material there are enough on this comment section to make me a very rich man. People are outraged at Putin for making demand at Ukraine but having no problem with US imposing unilateral sanction on dozens of nations and forcing the remaining 200 nations of the world to do the same. What Obama is doing to Iran and Syria are orders of magnitude worst than what Putin is asking but for some people, they don't see the hypocrisy.","Putin is trying to deflate the tension in Ukraine but it seems like Obama wants his war no matter what. It is as if Obama decided since he is losing on all foreign policy front he is going to be remembered as the one that stands up Putin, the premier statesman of his time. The US is tied to so many mess around the world I don't think any president in 2016 can solve it in 2 terms but Obama seems to want to start more problem. What's wrong with him?..Russia is backing Syria and Iran, the two guy that's fighting ISIL  ISIS in Iraq to stabalize the mess from the US invasion and poor power transfer caused. Why is Obama working against the enemy of his enemy?",Putin has been proposing ceasefire since June yet Kiev keeps sending military and militia to the separatist region and shelling city centers. The fact captures POWs are checked for Swastika pretty much tells you what type of people joins the militia.,Putin is dropping bombs and food in Iraq? Since when?,...... Mr. Obama told Mr. Putin during the call that the United States would like to see a diplomatic solution that involves Russia pulling back its troops from the Crimean Peninsula and not making any further steps to invade other parts of Ukraine...I want that sentence to read Mr. Putin tells Mr. Obama he would like to see NATO pull back its troops from Eastern Europe and not repeat the same mistake of invading Eastern Bloc nations again...It takes two to tangle tango and America have been doing a solo act ever since the Dtente ended by Regan in 1980.,"Putin is Russia. He will never betray Russia unlike Yeltsin. He is Washington's worst enemy because he cannot be bought, threaten or browbeated into submission. You know who else that cannot be corrupted? Washington, Franklin, Adams, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton. Obama needs tread carefully now. He aimlessly wondered into Russia's core interest and need to back out safely.","Say what you want about Putin and however he acquired Crimea, for the country of Russia, he is the best thing to happen to that country in the last 100 years. If Putin was running the show in the 80s', I am sure USSR would still be here and capitalistic. Ivan, Peter, Catherine and Putin. History in the making.","Putin and the rest of Europe already proposed a cease-fire last week but guess who keeps egging Kiev on to finish the separatists? Want to guess why Europe are not with the US on sanctions? Seriousely, I now just watch Al Jazeera, BBC and NHK for news now.

Dennis,,,,"I remember hearing Americans' stories of how Soviets blinked in Cuba's missile crisis, and how stern the look of JFK was when he looked down at Khruschev and browbeat him into backing down. ..Yet, later, we found out that actually, JFK, under the table, begged Khruschev not to put missiles in Cuba and offered him to remove his missiles in Turkey...This makes me wonder: what did Obama offer Putin this time? Recognition of Crimea?","If WW3 starts I will only blame the United States because EU doesn't want the war nor Russia wants the war..U.S. Intention was to pull Ukraine as far away from Russia as possible, make Ukraine a member of NATO, kick Russians out of the Black Sea where they have a military base, and most importantly put nuclear weapons in Ukraine on the Russian border so they can kindly tell Russians what to do..I don't justify Putin's annexation of Crimea but he had no choice just like America had no choice in the 1963 when Russians installed nuclear weapons in Cuba right next to America. U.S. Said, either you take them away or a war starts.FYI Russia was at major war a couple of times with superpower Sweden back in 17th century, with napolian, and with Hitler. All of those times Russia was not the aggressor just like nowadays.","I am really tired of reading kindergarten-level comments and articles about Ukraine. Putin is bad, evil and so forth. Realities are a lot more complex..Ukraine wants to be a part of EU? Sure, go stand after Turkey in line..What economically Western Urkaine can give to EU? Agricultural products?.Both EU and US markets are strongly protected. It is easy to go to Maidan and yell there, it is a lot more difficult to assess economic realities. People also need to do math. 1 billion  package from US! This is going to go a long way to help Ukraine. Russian offered 15 billions. When Russia proposed United Trade Zone it was interpreted as Purin trying to take control with his KGB friends . Perhaps this is the only way for Ukraine to grow economy by selling products to markers which are a lot for realistic for Ukraine..As is with US politics bumper-sticker understanding does absolutely nothing but harm to any attempts to find meaningful solutions to very real issues. Why am I not surprised that John McCain was a featured speaker on Maidan, the deep thinker that he is.","EU really is harming itself. South Stream would've provided a stable supply of gas that bypassed Ukraine. That means, there would be no interruption of supply to Europe because Ukraine decided to not pay its bills on and siphon off Russian gas. So what is the net result here? EU hurts itself while Putin finds an alternative source of revenue?..Ridiculous.","EU really is harming itself. South Stream would've provided a stable supply of gas that bypassed Ukraine.

Western media is largely ignoring this humanitarian crisis...It's about time Putin did something to help them.","And on top of all this, it looks like Mr. Putin's scheme will attract 15 to 20B from EU and US before this is done ... avoiding, or more likely reducing the 15B that Putin once offered, but helping to stem Ukraine's financial woes. Nice head fake Mr. Putin.","Steve, that happens because Mr. Putin does the right thing. Putin is real leader and has a lot of followers around the world, not only in the Russian parliament.

richard,,,,The USSR is back !   Soldiers to monitor 'free' elections  in another country no less.  Only   the old   Communist USSR   has a different name . KGB Putin seems to be quite a  fixture in the rebirth . Wonder how  flexible   Putin will require  America and the West to be  to accommodate his growing empire ?,"The US just keeps making a mountain out of the mole hill that is the Ukraine.  Where has the Ukraine been in our national consciousness for the past 20 years?  Of what vital intrest to the US is it versus, say, our schools, health care system, debt load, infrastructure etc etc?  It is a dangerous thing to put your credibility on the line against another nuclear  power that has very large interests in a next door neighbor (that is thousands of miles away from our shores).  And all this for what is at best a quasi legitimate government in the Ukraine.  Do we really think the oligarchs are going to be influencing Putin here?  What a dream.",,,,,,,,
Observer,,,,"The folks fighting the Kiev government in Eastern Ukraine (Donbas) are fighting against a junta imposed on the Ukrainians by a foreign sponsored (NATO) coup d'etat.  Why wouldn't any  freedom loving civilized person, as in a subscriber to the rule of law and legitimate governments, not support the so-called rebels in Eastern Ukraine?  How can the Luhansk and Donetsk fighters be called terrorists for fighting to preserve their own lives and communities?  ..When will the NYTimes quit trumpeting this State Department propaganda and facilitating the oppression of folks living in Novorossiya?  It is understandable that western interests want to get their hands on the natural resources and fixed capital of this heavily industrialized part of Ukraine.  It is also disgusting for supposed journalists to support this spectacularly vulgar wealth and power grab as a supposed counter to Putin and Russia.  A Russia I might add that is neither occupying a foreign country, nor is supporting with billions of dollars per year other allied countries occupying and oppressing indigenous populations...Does believing in honesty, stating the facts above and not buying the NATO propaganda make me a Kremlin troll?  We will see if this gets published or not.","Perhaps this happened, but with State controlled media, etc. who knows?..I read a letter from Eleanor Roosevelt to John Kennedy written days before the '60 election in which she said she was wary of potential surprise tricks from Richard Nixon to steal the election...Clearly Putin is capable of subverting anything democratic, and routinely does, having put his hand-picked crony into his previous position and now is reclaiming it with this phonied-up election...Assassination attempt? Rally round the flag, boys! Close ranks and elect the fearless leader again to show......He's a poor imitation of Sacha Baron Cohen.","It would appear the world needs Russia.  ..The United States and the Zionist project Israel have done irreparable to the societies in the Middle East and Persia.  Starting with the ethnic cleansing in Palestine in 1948, then the 1953 overthrow of the legally elected prime minister Mossadegh of Iran (to be replaced with the Shah), to the continued ethnic cleansing of Palestine today, the destruction of all institutions in Libya and Iraq, the United States has done damage on par with the very worst atrocities in human history.      These misdeeds only accelerated when the Soviet Union collapsed and a weaker Russia emerged.  ..The US created ISISISIL and other extremists due to the complete injustices it has repeatedly foisted on Arabs and Persians.   The Israelis are irredeemable homicidal thugs and a lost cause- that the US associates itself with such a lot should be an embarrassment to all Americans.  Our best Arab ally, Saudi Arabia, convicted a man of witchcraft recently and is planning to crucify him- what great company America keeps.  Neither Hussein nor Qadaffi did stuff like that, nor did they murder people like the US or Israel does.    ..SO maybe, just maybe, a strong Russia and Putin can save us Americans from ourselves.","There is nothing mysterious about the man.  He is much more intelligent than any of our last three presidents and has a spine.  The USA was a particularly bad winner when the USSR broke up, effectively rubbing Russia's nose in the mess left by the ossified Breshnev.  We were anything but gracious, but by exporting the wonders of American-style capitalism without the checks that protected American democracy up until the 80s created a monster.  Putin and his pals took over the resources before they became servants to multinationals in their own homeland.  ..What goads the power structure here is that the Russian oligarchs manage to do what our plutocracy want to do but are restricted due to the last vestiges of decency in America.  ..I could go on, but isn't it a bit ironic that now we are winding down two wars disastrous to anyone other than a defense contractor The Newspaper of Record is jumping on the bandwagon to start another war?  This is as bad as the run-up to the Iraq war.  Hasn't anyone noticed that the vast majority in Crimea wanted Russian Union?  Where are the reports on the demonstrations in Donetsk, Kharkov, Poltava and elsewhere for Russian union?  Why isn't anyone mentioning Ukraine was part of Russia in the same way Siberia is part of Russia since, well forever?  It is like saying Cornwall isn't part of Britain.  Don't forget Khrushchev and Brezhnev were Ukrainians and over one hundred thousand Russians died repelling the Germans from Ukraine in WWII...Stop.","Visionary McCain has written: The United States must look beyond Mr. Putin. His regime may appear imposing, but it is rotting inside. His Russia is not a great power on par with America. It is a gas station run by a corrupt, autocratic regime. And eventually, Russians will come for Mr. Putin in the same way and for the same reasons that Ukrainians came for Viktor F. Yanukovych...If so, why not just wait for Putin's regime to rot from inside?..How I wish visionary and astute McCain had won the 2008 presidential election, with Sarah Palin as his running mate!

Nick Wright,,,,"How is Russia creating more confusion and prolonging the war? I thought those were the problems bedevilling Western involvement?..The US is bombing ISIS and al Qaeda affiliate al Nusra.

However, the US wants to overthrow Assad as a first priority. But ISISal Nusra will be the ones to do it, not the good rebel force the US is failing to create...Is any of this confusing? Yes, all of it, to everyone...Which brings us to Prolonging the War: By helping the weakest rebels, and doing an ineffectual job of fighting ISIS from the air (only), the US is prolonging the war, since every Syrian and their allies who fear an ISIS victory will fight to the end...Enter Putin and Russia, whose first priority is to defeat the extremists, and who see dealing with Assad later as a secondary priority. As a strategy it seems clear enough to me. ISISal Nusra will be no match for a large, modern  armed force in the field--the rapid French rout of Islamists in northern Mali a few years ago being a good recent example...It's no wonder President Obama is once again following Putin's lead, as he did when Putin's diplomacy led to the peaceful and internationally supervised dismantling of Syria's WMD capability.

Obama knows an ally when he sees one.","Interesting analysis; however, there is an important omission that justifies Putin's distrust of the West...Russia abstained in the UNSC's Libya resolution (along with China, Germany, India and Brazil) because it was only for a no-fly zone to prevent government air attacks on the eastern rebels...Putin was subsequently furious because NATO promptly co-opted the resolution as cover for a major air campaign to overthrow Qaddafi, attacking government ground forces throughout the country, not just Libyan air assets. Putin naturally felt betrayed by NATO, and very reasonably deplored yet another Western overthrow of a foreign government in the region, leading to the destruction of its society...Complicating current Western government and media attempts to paint him as a dangerous despot, Putin has earned a lot of sympathy among Western populations for his recent actions in the region. He helped bring about detente with Iran, and his diplomacy led to the peaceful dismantling of Syria's WMD capability (incidentally also helping President Obama escape a rash promise to bomb Syrian forces). Now he has taken decisive action to do the obvious in Syria: stop the barbarians first, and deal with Assad later...The integrity of the state is naturally of paramount importance--recent history gives stark lessons on what happens when it is ignored. In this light, Putin looks to many like the most responsible player in the region.","The US daren't attack Putin militarily--especially when so many Americans seem to approve of his actions in Syria. Instead, it seems, US talking heads are reduced to attacking him with pop psychology, trying to wound him by inventing shallow and insulting pathologies for his every move...Seriously? Did the author interpret Obama's bombing of Libya, a UN member state, in terms of past experiences that led him to fear strong government, that takes decisive action to put down armed rebellion?..It's kind of sad, really, and a sign of impotence...whoops, now I'm doing the pop psychologizing. I suspect Sigmund Freud spins in his grave so often that he could be wrapped in copper and connected to the grid as an alternate power source. Along with Adam Smith...","It's really quite simple...Since Putin controls the chessboard, he knows he will eventually get what he wants: greater autonomy for Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians and thereby a buffer against NATO's aggressive encroachment on Russia's borders...Russian-speaking Ukrainians don't trust the hostile Kiev regime--for obvious reasons. It voted to rob them of Russian as an official language (countered by a Presidential veto, but too late) and then it launched a civil war instead of negotiating. The bitterness that will remain after the shooting stops means that it will be long time before a credible national election can be held. Some kind of negotiated autonomy for the region is the more likely outcome--gaining Russia influence over the region so that it will remain a buffer against NATO's relentless encroachment on Russia's borders. Putin will stop there...For things to be different, the US and NATO would need to make the sacrifices implied by military action or absolute sanctions. They won't. Instead, they'll continue their empty and increasingly embarrassing (because hypocritical) shouting about sovereign nations and their stale Cold War rhetoric (who believes that Putin plans to attack the Baltic states and Poland?)...Russians are strongly behind Putin, and the West underestimates them (again) if it thinks a few sanctions will turn them against him. Checkmate in three moves.","This report says that the Kremlin statement made no mention of Crimea, suggesting Mr. Putin considers the matter a fait accompli that is no longer up for discussion...The White House statement didn't mention Crimea either; are we to assume that Mr. Obama also considers the matter a fait accompli that is no longer up for discussion? If so, it would seem that Mr. Putin's move on Crimea was successful and that the U.S. is no longer demanding that it be ceded back to control by the Kiev regime as a condition of resolving the international tensions...I notice some comments wondering if Mr. Putin just blinked. I think it was the other way around.","NATO criticizes Russia over the sanctity of sovereign nations, but it has repeatedly made clear to the world that to NATO the concept is completely arbitrary. This kind of fundamental hypocrisy is a moral weakness, and ignoring it doesn't make it go away...Also, few commentators talk about NATO's intentions towards Russia. For a while, things went quite well between the West and Putin (except for NATO betraying his trust by turning a UN Security Council-mandated no-fly zone in Libya into an air war against a Libyan government NATO didn't like). He was very helpful in getting chemical weapons out of Syria (and saving President Obama from his own overreaction), and he's been constructive in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program...Regardless, Washington has never given up on its long-cherished desire to hem Russia in, and to isolate and diminish it as a world power--including placing missile systems on its borders. Putin and most educated people know all this, so no one is surprised that he is determined to keep a buffer zone between Russia and NATO...Now Putin has forced a weak, hostile and unrepresentative Kiev regime to negotiate with disenfranchised Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians, while showing up NATO's moral and military weakness. It's been a masterful strategical and tactical performance, you have to admit. And now that the buffer is restored, Europeans can sleep well at night.","The great irony is that this move by the tiny G-7 elitist club will likely end up strengthening the more inclusive and representative G-20, which many people see as a more democratic economic forum for the community of nations...Could this be the death knell for the G-7? Few will miss it, except for the handful of people who think they have the right to set the economic agenda for the rest of the world...It seems they're playing into Putin's hands, since he has much more clout in the G-20, whose members account for 85 of the world's GDP. Their reaction also makes NATO look toothless and irrelevant. It seems only useful for overthrowing helpless governments in marginal societies (and making things immeasurably worse for their citizens). If this one stroke by Putin ends the G-7 and reveals NATO for what it really is, he will gain a lot more than consolidation of traditonal Russian territory for his troubles.","Does anyone in the West have a sense of irony when it comes to Russia?..The West has concocted a narrative wherein Putin must invade eastern Ukraine to avoid humiliation should the Kiev forces defeat the Russian-speaking rebels in the east. But Putin has said all along that he doesn't want to own eastern Ukraine; it would be a giant economic headache for one thing. He says he wants greater autonomy for the region within a united Ukraine that protects the Russian-speaking millions in the east from a hostile Kiev regime, and restores their political enfranchisement after it was stripped from them by the pro-Europe coup in Kiev...And how could he be humiliated after the people of Crimea voted, peacefully, to rejoin Russia? That seems like a very large geopolitical gain for Putin, given that he managed to secure Russia's only warm-water naval base...Now Putin is doing what Washington is doing elsewhere by sending a relief mission--in cooperation with the Red Cross--to help the people of Donetsk, who are being mercilessly shelled and deprived by the Kiev forces. But the West and the Kiev regime trot out the hysterical Cold War battle cry: The Russians plan to invade! Then Kiev and Washington suddenly pivot and support the relief mission, shamelessly claiming credit for it...Putin still looks the most statesmanlike in this Russia-NATO confrontation that erupted when NATO tried to wrest Ukraine from Russia's sphere of influence.","It seems highly suspicious to me that, within a few hours of the plane coming down, the Ukraine government was all over the airwaves, not only with what seemed like well-prepared statements condemning the rebels and Russia, but also a video--they claim without proof--to show a Russian Buk missile launcher heading towards Russia with one of its missiles missing (how do we know it wasn't a Ukrainian missile launcher?) and an audio recording--they claim without proof--to be of a conversation between a rebel and a Russian discussing the shooting down of the plane. It sounded all too pat to me...Of course if you ask cui bono? (who benefits?) from this horrible tragedy, the only possible benefactor is a desperate Ukraine government, which is struggling not to lose the war it declared on the eastern Ukraine separatists. Now both it and the Western governments have a huge club with which to beat the separatists and the Putin government. This is not a time to be credulous."
jiminy,,,,"Well, actually Ukraine was independent briefly after WWI before Stalin reabsorbed it and starved half the population.  Comparing the forces in Western Ukraine to fhe forces in Afghanistan makes no sense at all.  Your assumption as to the overall ideology of the interim government, I am assuming from your context, is that they were what, fascists?  This assumption does not reflect reality and is the view perpetrated by Russian media.  In fact the same parliament that was there under Yanukovich  is still there.  Western Ukrainians are not fascist, nor is the representative government of Ukraine.  There are more fascists in France. Ukrainians are idealists if anything.  I pray that this new generation in Ukraine can break free of the old government's  post Soviet hangover, and current Putin aggression","Woah: Dan, ya'll are playin' fast and loose with facts.  The reality is it seems that ol' Putin's forces has been behind most o' the killin' in Ukraine thus far.  Likely even some of the proRussian forces, so he could blame it on those Western fascists.  But really, don't let the facts trouble you too much.  Yeah, those darn Ukrainians, they practically invited Russia to invade.","Did you consider that those countries joined NATO for protection from Russian expansionism which they justifiably fear?  Putin invading Ukraine under a false and illegal pretext undermines any credibility to Russian rights' to Crimea.  No one had threatened to remove Russian bases from Crimea.  Further autonomy for Crimea was already on the agenda in Ukraine.  The idea that the rest of the world thought of Russia as a second rate country is a fiction of an insecure government and population, not based in reality.  Judging from Putin's actions in Ukraine it is he who believes in exceptionalism of himself and his country.   By invading neighboring countries and supporting genocidal dictators in others (Syria, North Korea), Putin does not benefit his country but isolates its people and pushes it back to it's darker history..Many people in these posts keep ranting about the hypocrisy of the West.  We do however, have a free press (although FOX news is like Republican state run media; fake news and propaganda), can criticize our government without going to jail, and can throw the bums out in four years if necessary, none of which applies to Russia.  125 of the people voted in Crimea.  Sounds a little suspicious, but I am sure the Russian soldiers, the Russians pensioners and the Russian nationalists are very happy.  Maybe everyone else is afraid they will be shot at,  beaten, stabbed or worse.  Putin's calculations are for his own benefit, for Russian people, not so much.","What is interesting about Putins speech is how he consistantly flips blame to the US and EU even preemptively claiming we will be the cause of the people of Russia being hurt by the economy when it tanks because of his aggressive actions.  He cannot justify the invasion in reality.  There was no threat of Ukraine kicking Russian troops out of Crimea - one of his newer excuses for invasion.  There was no threat to Russian speakers in Crimea or any where else in Ukraine - another false premise, and in fact giving Crimea more automy from Ukraine was actually on the agenda for the new government in Kiev. Ukraine wanted good relations with Russia and the EU.  What they did not want and what seems to be lost in debate, is a corrupt puppet government under Russian control;  ironically a big part of the problem in Crimea as well.  The villification of the West may play well with as propaganda to the masses in Russia, who he is whipping into an anti-West frenzy, threatening all dissenters in Russia with charges of treason, but in fact it is Putin's illegal and aggressive actions in Crimea and the fomenting of unrest by his underlings in eastern Ukraine  that will be the direct cause of any economic hardship suffered by the Russian people in Russia and now Crimea.  Putin himself is the biggest threat to the stability of Russia.  Putin seems incapable of taking responsibility for his own bad judgement, and ultimately Crimea will prove a very expensive prize for Russia.","You are bit conspiracy theory cynical and also completely wrong about US involvement.  It is however, fairly clear that Putin had been planning the invasion of Crimea for quite some time, long before the Socchi Olympics.","First of all, 80 of Ukrainians speak Russian because they were forced to when they were under Soviet rule.  Ukrainians are not against Russians, many of them have Russian relatives.  What the vast majority of Ukrainians DO NOT want is to be a Satellite of Putin's Russia, and who can blame them? Many Russians don't want to be a part of Putin's version of Russia.  Ukranians DO NOt want to be ruled by the corrupt system they are subject to now.  The US and UE are not arming dissadents.  This majority of protests in Ukraine have been peaceful.  The violence that has occured has been provoked primarily by pro- government forces and provoceteurs.  Yes there has limited violence by the more nationalistic parties involved.  But really, what do you think the USEU is arming them with?  Cobblestones and home made molotov cocktails?  All the deaths and cases of torture have been the work pro government forces.   Your false accusations are what are provocative.","This has been my experience as well.  Many Ukrainians have at least on relative who is Russian.  Ukranians as a whole are not anti-Russian.  They are anti-corrupt government, anti-oppressive government, pro-independent Ukraine.  They do not want to be a vassal state.  I would also say a big danger for Ukraine besides Putin's meddling is the potential influence ultra nationalist groups such as Svaboda.  However, I believe most Ukrainians do not buy into the ultra nationalist agenda which is both anti-Russia and anti-EU and is if looked at carefully, not pro-Ukrainian, but cut from the same cloth as the racist white fascist groups in this country.  Ukrainians must be vigilant, and do their home work when they vote.  I wish people would the same in this country.","Funny thing, Ukraine wanted to have good relations with both Russia and EU.  Putin wanted them only to have  economic relations with Russia (i.e., economic obligations to) and dealings  with EU only indirectly with  Russian control.","Putin will use that as his reason for not complying.  Even if Maidan does comply, he will not.  He will keep saying Russia is not responsible for the unrest in Eastern Ukraine.  We will be duped again.","Of course Putin was involved in the Maidan shootings.  The main thing you got wrong was that Fascists over threw the pro-Russian goverment.  That is not what happened, and the hundreds of thousands of protesters at Maidan were not fascists.  They were citizens who abhorred a corrupt and murderous government.  Yanukovich fled the country  immediately after signing an internationally brokered agreement (which Russia refused to sign) that was supposed to maintain stability until the next election.  He fled because he feared he would be impeached and tried for war crimes after the Maidan slaughter.  The parliament (which was the same  parliament under Yanukovich) held and an emergency session and legitimately appointed an interim president to stabliize the government until the elections scheduled for May 25 can be held.  Putin has been doing everything in his power to destabilize Ukraine."
Kenneth Ranson,,,,"Since February I have been saying on this board that Vladimir Putin intended to invade Ukraine and to occupy its territory at least as far as the Dnieper River.  I have also pointed out that his actions to achieve this follow almost exactly the actions of Adolph Hitler in annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia prior to World War II.  ..For my trouble I have been called a liar, a war monger, and told that I was dishonoring the memory of the victims of the holocaust, though I suspect this last charge was made by a paid agent of the Russian state.  ..Putin's latest move, again, exactly parallels the program of Hitler.  Before annexing Czechoslovakia, Hitler fomented unrest among the German speakers of the Sudetenland.  The fact that he used paid agents to do this was an open secret to the world.  Hitler then demanded that the Czechs withdraw their army from Sudetenland, where they had built a line of fortifications which were crucial to their national defense.  With today's announcement Putin has taken exactly the same steps...I have to believe that other people can see this pattern but that they choose to ignore it on the grounds that it would be wrong to go to war over something of as little value as eastern Ukraine, and that once appeased Putin will not advance beyond the Dniester.  I can only pray that this cynical and prejudiced attitude is correct.  The history of dictatorship suggests that it is not.","Your position is the Russian position, and has been presented repeatedly on this site by people who apparently carry a brief for the Russian government.  It is too simplistic by half.  Russia has repeatedly interfered in the internal affairs of Ukraine by economic and political means, both openly and in secret.  Russia took advantage of division among Ukrainian voters to secure the election of Yanukovich, and then used his position as president of Ukraine to move the country toward an alliance with Russia. This position was opposed by a vast majority of the Ukrainian people, apparently including a large number of Ukrainians of Russian ethnicity.  ..To represent the overthrow of Yanukovich as a western plot is nonsense.  The vast majority of Ukrainians want a free nation, independent of Russia, and able to trade with both east and west.  I understand Putin's disappointment that his scheme to have Yanukovich act as a Quisling to betray Ukraine into Russian control did not work, but that does not mean that Putin is now entitled to obtain the same result by force.","I find this article completely unconvincing.  I believe that Putin's Russia has had a plan of long standing that called for seizing by military force and re-annexing, all of Ukraine east of the Dniester, Crimea, and Odessa.  This would give Russia all of the Black Sea coast as well as a defensible border with NATO, the line of the Dniester River.  It would also give Russia almost all of the industry in Ukraine and would place all of Kiev within range of Russian artillery, which would prevent substantial investment in Kiev, and leave the remaining portion of Ukraine an impoverished hinterland...Putin, wisely, decided to carry out this policy in stages to gauge western reaction.  When the Netherlands and Germany, Russia's two largest trading partners, agreed to wink at Russian occupation of Crimea but indicated that they would cut off trade if Russia seized the balance of eastern Ukraine, Putin paused in his plan.  When and whether he will resume it is an open question...I believe that this analysis has much more support from the observed facts that the one proposed by the Times.","In the late 1930s the members of the Oxford Union passed a resolution that they were resolved not to fight for King and Country.  I would like to say at the outset of this post that I believe very much in world peace and in taking concrete action to obtain it.  But I also believe that the easiest thing that one can do to pretend to support peace and yet ensure that it cannot come, is to refuse to physically oppose the aggression of dictators.  ..As Churchill points out, the Oxford students were ignoring, as the whole Western World was ignoring, the very definite steps being taken by Hitler to launch the Second World War.  And it was the same generation of students who would die by the millions to defeat Hitler once he was fully armed. ..There is a strong body of thought on this board to the effect that, war is so 20th century and no one should talk about fighting ever again.  With that I am in complete agreement.  The problem is the one that the Oxford students had in 1936.  Vladimir Putin is a dictator.  He answers to no one, and no thing but the lust for power.  And he is perfectly willing to take anything the United States is not willing to fight for...We should be willing to fight for the freedom of the Ukrainian people.  America has been willing to buy peace by throwing away the rights of eastern Europeans at least since Munich in 1938. This shame should not be repeated and no number of snappy comments ignoring world history are sufficient to disguise that fact.","If we let Putin have Ukraine, then the Baltic States are next.  Look at the comments from his agents on this site if you doubt me. We have to fight him somewhere, and the right place is here and now.","There is one person who could force Putin to end the war, she is Angela Merkel.  But she seems unwilling to risk any economic inconvenience for Germany in order to end Putin's proxy war in Ukraine.","I'm just curious, where does you paycheck for these posts come from.  I mean is it KGB, Russian foreign service, TASS?  I assume you're getting paid since you post 10 or 20 times a day under this name on this site.  And I assume you are a Russian agent since you spout the Putin line on everything.  I also assume you are a man and that you use the name Judy for this account because with this persona you tend to take the, the US is dirty, I am for peace at any price, line a lot more often.  ..I'd also like to know if I can get in on it.  I mean for enough money I'm willing to spout the Putin line too.","On February 27 I posted this comment on this website:.To date Putin has, rejected the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government, given asylum to its wanted, deposed dictator, fomented rebellion in Crimea, including the use of Russian troops and visits from Russian politicians, and, oh yes, mobilized his entire military and sent it to the Ukrainian border. Not only is it clear what Putin is going to do, he is in the blatant process of doing it. And that is to invade and occupy those areas of Ukraine with any significant ethnically Russian population...I stand by that analysis. Vladimir Putin intends to invade and occupy eastern Ukraine.  By calling on the US and its allies to prepare only sanctions, the Times is ruling out the only measure that will stop Putin's invasion and that is military force.",,

I admit it would be sad if his bombs killed the five soldiers we trained, but war is hell.","To the Netanyahu lobby, Putin's main sin is that he is our natural ally in the Middle East.  Anti-Islamic because of Chechnia, he has supported the strong, secular anti-Islamic rulers like Saddam, Kaddafi, and Assad who are necessary for modernization.  We overthrow or create ISIS in a vain attempt to do so...Netanyahu wants disorder in the region to keep the US in and to keep himself in power.  He allies with the most fundamentalist anti-human-rights regime in the area, Saudi Arabia that creates and  finances those like ISIS. He is much like the Putin that Friedman describes...So the Netanyahu lobby in the US--and Friedman is its foremost spokesman--smears Putin.   How would we react to Russia organizing a pro-Russia revolution in Canada?  How did we react to a mere alliance between Castro and the Soviet Union?  Putin is quite happy with Ukraine being a Canada with federalism like Canada.   He does not demand a Cuba...The real fear of the lobby is that Putin will ally with Iran to prevent an Israeli air strike.  Sending Russian planes would do it, and Putin has a natural ally in Iran against Pakistan in favor of the Farshi (Tajiks) in the Afghanistan we have destroyed and will disintegrate next.    The crucial point in the negotiations with Iran was postponed until after the election because it will produce another crisis.","This is just US propaganda, not a news story.  Putin is right.

What would the US do in such a Russian case in Mexico or Canada  (The distance from the naval base in Sevastopol to Damascus is absolutely the same as from Houston to Mexico City)  ..The US supported the overthrow of the elected Ukrainian President a year before the next election because he was going to win on an anti-EU platform.  What would the US do if Putin did that in Ottawa?..Putin supports secular rulers like Kaddafi, Saddam, and Assad against fundamentalist Arabia that created ISIS because he fears Chechnia.  He is our natural ally in the Middle East but we are ruled by Netanyahu who wants disorder to legitimate apartheid.  (Netanyahu has so little fear about Iran that he fervertly supported the overthrow of Saddam, the bulwark against Iran.) One could even dream that we are moving into alliance with him.  Let's hope so","Exactly.  Give Putin the excuse he wants to tighten the economic sanctions on Europe that he wants    He has all the economic cards in his hands...Do read Krugman's column on the collapse of France.  The Times seems intent on making sure it really collapses and brings the European and American economies down with it...If the Times had accurately reported the intensely anti-Semitic character of Brat's successful campaign again Cantor and the Wall Street banks, it would not be so eager to have the collapse of the economy that would turn it into a nation-wide movement even if Christie controls it with his codeword attack on crony capitalism...If the NYTimes editors were not insane, they would say that the Administration should force its Ukrainian puppet government to negotiate the Canadian-like constitution that Putin is demanding and that is in our interests too...Of course, that means telling Obama to fire his Secretary of State Robert Kagan and Undersecretary Victoria Nuland and replace them with an unknown as Secretary.  A man called Kerry would make a great Secretary of State.","First, Obama has other chances at an achievement.  Just  quietly tell Bibi that we are planning to take Israel to the UN on charges of apartheid and call for South African like sanctions.   That would achieve a peace in 30 seconds.  Only those in the Netanyahu lobby like Cohen could object.   Pro-Israel supporters would applaud.  A joint American-Russian-UN peace force would provide it the peace Israel needs...Second, what is the evidence that this is not simply a game in Iran as the deadline approaches?  Then what happens if there is no deal?   My guess is that as Israel prepares to attack, Putin will fly his planes into Iran to protect it.  He stopped an American flyover strategy in Syria with clear signals he would intervene.   He and Iran have a common interest in defending the Tajiks (Farshi) against nuclear Pakistan as it supports the Pashtuni as Afghanistan collapses.  Iran needs a bomb against Pakistan and could not care less about Israel.","We installed the Ukrainian government--Mrs. Robert Kagan (Victoria Nuland) with her famous statement about EU that can not be posted in the NYT.   They are totally dependent on our money to pay for Russian gas and oil.   They should simply be told to introduce the Canadian-Quebec constitution that Putin wants. .. That way the small minority of Catholics in the West (really Poles given by Hitler to Stalin in 1939) and the Ukrainians with their native Russian language in the east can be given the Quebec like autonomy they should have.   With both in the Parliament as Putin wants, Parliament will have a balanced foreign policy...If Putin had intervened in Canada as we did in Ukraine, we would treat it as we did (and do)  Cuba.   Although this time the Cuban invasion would not fail.  it is difficult for us to believe that a Putin actually simply wants a Canada, not a Cuba or an annexed province.","This is just US propaganda, not a news story.

stu freeman,,,,"It's rather nonsensical to say that Ukraine has been Moscow's victory and the core failure of Berlin and Washington.  Two years ago all of Ukraine belonged, at least in a de facto sense, to Putin and Russia.  Now he owns only Crimea (which is populated mostly by Russian-speakers who were in any case longing for reunification with the motherland) and arguably the borderlands in Ukraine's northeast.  The rest of the country is lost to them forever- or would be if the EU would reciprocate the love from Kiev.  The best thing Ukraine's current leaders can do is to cut their losses by renouncing ties with Donetsk and Luhansk; let Moscow absorb those areas as it did Crimea and burden Commissar Putin with responsibility for their upkeep.","Can't wait to see what happens when Putin's hard-line Russian Orthodox values inevitably come into conflict with hard-line Islam in the Caucasus region.  The folks in that area surely haven't forgotten what commissar Putin did to Chechnya.  Many Chechens are presently frighting with al Qaeda and ISIS but at some point they're likely to come home- and to bring a lot of their new-found Kalashnikov-toting friends with them. If Russia wants to be Russia it needs to think seriously about ridding itself of Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan and so on.",Interesting how Putin supports secession for Crimea but not for Kosovo.  Did he support the case for secession in the northern Caucasus?  Can't recall...,"Mark: Meanwhile it's Putin who's been using the Jews to defend his incursion into Ukraine, denouncing the folks in the western half of the country as neo-Nazis akin to those who fought the Russians during the last World War. Just a little bit much....Also, last time I looked it was Russia that attacked Georgia, not the other way around. One can argue that South Ossetia should not have been given to Georgia in the first place but, on other hand, I haven't seen Putin offer the folks in North Ossetia (let alone those in Chechnya, Dagestan, etc.) the option of leaving Russia..I agree that talk of a domino theory engineered by Putin is way premature and probably bogus. Even so, his behavior in Ukraine is repellant and his stated motivations and denials of direct involvement are thoroughly disingenuous.","Let's not forget that Ukraine's historical ties to Russia inlude Stalin's man-made famine that killed 7 million Ukrainian's in the early 1930s.  I'm certain that Ukraine hasn't forgotten..In any case, the West needs to confront Putin- not so much in Ukraine (where Kiev's apparent use of cluster bombs in the east doesn't buy its leaders much in the way of sympathy) as in Syria where Moscow's disgraceful embrace of Bashar-the-Butcher-Son-of-a-Butcher has helped to enable ISIS and to bathe the entire region in bedlam and bloodshed.  We need to tell Putin that he can keep his naval base in Syria ONLY if he takes a hands-off attitude towards the demise of the Assad regime.  ISIS is the bigger problem over there but neither Syria nor Iraq can be fixed while The Butcher is still governing Damascus.  We need to establish a no-fly zone over there- just as the Turks have demanded- and give the go-ahead for Ankara, the Kurds and the non-ISIS Sunnis to dispose of all of these people (with air-power from the U.S. and its allies providing the necessary cover).  ISIS would ultimately be cornered in Mosul and defeated by the Kurds and Iraqi Shiites (with allied air-power continuing). We've lost too much time trying to placate Commissar Putin.  Let's find out how far he's willing to go to defend his puppet in Syria.","It's clear that there are now two Ukraines, with one belonging to the East and the other to the West.  Instead of looking at this as a defeat for the U.S. and its allies we should take note of the fact that up until a year ago the whole country more or less belonged to Commissar Putin. The western half of the country is lost to him forever now: if he dared to attack Kiev the citizens of western Ukraine would do to the Russian army what the mujhadin in Afghanistan did to their predecessors.  Let Putin have Donetsk and Luhansk so long as he's willing to spend millions of rubles that he doesn't have supplying those folks with free petrol and food.  And can the media please shut down the tag team of McCain and Graham- Lords of War?   Even their GOP brethren are now opposed to seeing the U.S. take the lead in resolving every one of the world's conflicts by sending arms or troops to the scene of hostilities.","I hate to say so but sending arms to Kiev would only provide Putin with an excuse to openly dispatch Russian troops. What we need to do is to make it absolutely clear to Moscow that western Ukraine is now and forever part of Europe. If the Russians were to cross the Dneiper and attack Kiev they'd find NATO forces waiting for them on the other side. As for Donetsk, Luhansk, etc., it's best to give those people the autonomy they've demanded.  Let Putin spend more of Russia's diminishing resources to keep his brethren in the East from freezing this winter.",@Jo Boost: We have lots of ethnic Russians living here in NYC.  If Putin didn't like he way they were being treated would he invade the U.S.?,"Too many of our right-wingers are up in arms because the U.S. and its NATO allies managed to place Russia in a box following the disintegration of the Soviet Union and now find that Russia has gnawed a small hole in that box.  Ossetia, Abkhazia, Trans-Dneister, Crimea.  How many Americans (neocons included) can find any of them on a map?  Do we really want to confront Putin over the future of small, mostly rural enclaves whose inhabitants already have historic ties to Russia and feel no great sense of loyalty to the political entity within whose borders they happen to reside? Is it weakness on the part of President Obama that keeps him from declaring war on those ignorant peons, the Russkies (per General Jack D. Ripper in Dr. Strangelove) or is it an awareness that most Americans are tired of having their sons and daughters shipped overseas to die for reasons that have nothing to do with our precious freedoms?  Putin will continue to creep out of that box to support his man in Damascus (our only counter-move there would be to arm al-Qaeda: does anyone think that's a good idea?) and he may even try to take advantage of dissension in eastern Ukraine.  Taken separately or collectively, such moves are too small to be of real concern to a nuclear-armed democracy that has more important things to take care of here at home.","Even if you truly believe that O.J. Simpson was entirely innocent and that his wife and her male friend had actually killed one another it's impossible to conclude that anyone other than Ramzan Kadyrov plotted the assassination of Mr. Nemtsov.  Putin may or may not have been directly involved but the murder was carried out for his benefit and no one but Kadyrov could have possibly given the go-ahead. I imagine that the suspects in this case will ultimately be acquitted and that the crime, like so many others in Putin's Russia, will go unsolved."

Obama is the wrong man to lead the nation in these troubled times.This latest burst of threats from Russia, is the result of Obama's lack of resolve in the Ukraine. Allowing Russia to take over the Crimea, &amp; Eastern Ukraine without drawing a line in the sand, sent a message of Nato's weakness in confronting Putin's aggression.We must look back in history at Kennedy's blockade of Cuba,The world seemed at the verge of a nuclear war, but Kennedy had the resolve to confront the Russian aggression &amp; the Russians backed off..We must demonstrate that we are prepared to stand up to the Russians by sending a major force of Nato Troops with our most advanced weapons into the Baltic States, or as Teddy Roosevelt said, speak softly but carry a big stick.At this point anyone reading this would think I lost my sense of reality, but I firmly believe showing our resole to stand up to Russia, would stop their aggression, &amp; rather than war would bring peace. Even the lunatic that leads North Korea does not want a nuclear war, Putin is not a lunatic, to the contrary, there is a motive to his seemingly madness, He wants to keep the West out of his sphere of influence,He believes he can frighten Obama into removing all Western military missile defense systems from Eastern Europe, &amp; he will get his wish,because Obama will do anything, in order to leave office unscathed.","You have to give that little tyrant Putin credit.

Back when the Soviet Union and the U.S. realized that each could annihilate each other--and the Whole World in the process, both reduced their nuclear warheads--and have continued to do so...Additional Troop in the proximity of Ukraine--but not in it or near its borders--might cause Putin the stand-down.  He really cannot afford to go to War, and the news of Russian soldiers returning home in caskets with questionable Death Certificates is getting out to the Russian People.  It can also be questioned as to whether the pro-Russian Separatists can even function on their own...<a hrefhttp:thetruthoncommonsense.com titlehttp:thetruthoncommonsense.com targetblank>http:thetruthoncommonsense.com<a>","The question now is whether the situation in Ukraine, looking more and more like an Invasion, will finally get Europe on-board.  Putin surely is keeping a watchful eye on the Islamic State and, perhaps, considering that now IS the time to act--as the U.S. is becoming more and more involved there...<a hrefhttp:thetruthoncommonsense.com titlehttp:thetruthoncommonsense.com targetblank>http:thetruthoncommonsense.com<a>","When Vladimir Putin leaves office, perhaps decades from now, he will certainly have a whole bunch of markers to cash in.

Russia marches to a different drummer and, as long as Vladimir Putin is in charge, his country will NOT be subservient to another country--or to another Leader...Also, think of how much Russia's land mass is larger than the entire rest of Europe.  The Population is roughly half of that of the European Union, almost four times what Germany's is.  But, its economy is totally sub-par as compared to the.E. U.--even to Club Med, the countries to the south.  Also, just think of the virtual impossibility in trying to meld Russia into the EuroZone?  What a joke!..Lastly, the Russian People are a proud bunch, they live a hard life; but, unfortunately, Vladimir Putin just makes it that much harder.  ..Russia would never fit into the E. U.; but, not surely could find ways to, at least, try to work with it.  But, under Putin, that will NEVER happen.  ..<a hrefhttp:thetruthoncommonsense.com titlehttp:thetruthoncommonsense.com targetblank>http:thetruthoncommonsense.com<a>","Economically, Russia is a basket case.  Sure, it had to Annex Crimea--with a m majority of ethnic Russians--because Russia couldn't allow its only cold water Naval Base to fall under the West's Control...But, given its own financial problems, as well as the problem in absorbing Crimea, it cannot possibly take-on more people--and infrastructure problems--than it already has, back home...Vladimir Putin's only solution is is to do nothing with regard to the break-away regions.  Once they realize that they would be giving up the Ukraine infrastructure, the reality will set-in.  Then, perhaps, they will be clamoring to re-join Ukraine...<a hrefhttp:thetruthoncommonsense.com titlehttp:thetruthoncommonsense.com targetblank>http:thetruthoncommonsense.com<a>"
Dick Diamond,,,,"Poor assumption.  For Russia to really look inward and help it's people, is not in the plan, especially with the Oligarchs friends with Putin.  This reminds me of 19th Century Tsarist Russia, especially Nicholas I, who began the slogan, Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nation.  Putin has revival of that slogan.",Polish Foreign Minister Sikorski reminds US that the US &amp; Russia signed an agreement to defend the territorial integrity of the Ukraine in case of attack . . ..And territorial integrity means not a) letting a country be taken over by another andor b) not partitioning the country.  Putin knows this.  So the U.S. So does NATO and the EU.,This is the redux of the Romanov's control over Russia from Peter the Great in the late 1600's.  Putin is just another Romanov Tsar in modern clothing.  This should not be news to historians of Russian history.,The fact that Oligarchs are tied to Putin is typical of Russia in the late 17th to mid 19th Century (From Peter I to Alexander II if not Alexander III.)  Not a surprise for the Russian government and Oligarchs.,"The Russians are doing little more than the United States has done for decades all over the world.  It buys its way into a country.  What's good for the goose is as good for the gander.  That's what competition in the world of world trade and economics is all about.  Putin gives money to Ukraine.  America give money to???Israel, Pakistan, India, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Taiwan (oops Taiwan buys our bonds) China gives money to fund the U.S. government by the trillions by buying our bonds as does England and Japan.  So?  What's the problem with the Russians doing the same thing?","As long as the Army is behind Putin.  As long as the Army is behind Yanukovich, the Tsar of Russia, Vlad I has nothing to worry about.  What you have is a rebirth of the Romanov Dynasty with a little Ivan IV thrown in.  As conservative as they come.  He even had his people renew Nicholas I mantra of Orthodoxy, Authority, Nation.  Putin has brought the Russian Orthodox Church back to 19th Century power.  He's even brought back the Cossacks.  How conservative can you get?  How Tsarist can you get?",,,,
Pete,,,,"So we put equipment stashes (i.e. military bases) next to Russia ... and Putin just acquiesces? Wrong, Putin will escalate.","The key statistics are: 1) Putin has a amassed a personal 40 Billion Fortune by stealing from his country. 2) 110 of his cronies own 35 of the wealth of Russia. 3) According to Credit Suisse, the median or average wealth is 871 per person. In india , it's over 1000 per person. The average citizen is being subjugated and impoverished. He is destroying his own Country. There does not appear any competent opposition left to overthrow his reign of terror. A concerted effort is required by the responsible Nations.",Putin will protect his naval base in Syria at all costs. Just as he did in Ukraine. Makes one wonder if Obama targeted Assad for the same reason he targeted Ukraine.,"Since it now looks like the Russian troops will conquer both the railway hub and the port prior to Sunday's truce, why would Mr. Putin then violate the truce? He has won everything he wanted: the Ukraine is neutered and he doesn't have to pay for it. What should happen, but never will, is that the Ukraine should just cede the conquered territory to Russia and make Russia provide the necessary services and money. The remaining territory can then be pro-West, and possibly even join Nato.","Since neither Western Europe nor the U.S. felt that the Ukraine was worth defending, as demonstrated by our unwillingness to do anything more than declare ineffective sanctions against Russia, we have no right to complain about the outcome. The absurdity of this is that Kiev is supposed to provide services to, and pay the salaries of, the separatists in the Eastern Ukraine. The only action that make sense is to split the Ukraine. Let the separatists either declare an independent Russian Ukrainia, or let Mr. Putin take responsibility for the economic viability of his new vassal state. Let the Western Ukraine trade with, and ally itself with, Western Europe, and allow any IMF funds loaned to Kiev be used entirely to establish an economically viable Western Ukraine. This would, in fact, be consistent with history, where the Western portion of the Ukraine was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while the Eastern portion was Soviet.",Putin will protect his naval base in Syria at all costs. Just as he did in Ukraine. Makes one wonder if Obama targeted Assad for the same reason he targeted Ukraine.,"I think everyone recognizes from the outset that there is no good answer for the Ukraine. In a separate column on this page, Mr. Mearsheimer spends an entire column arguing for doing nothing. Sanctions have failed for 50 years with Cuba, with North Korea since the Korean War, as far as we can tell, with Iran, and certainly not to date with Russia. All of these countries suffered due to sanctions, but none have changed their fundamental course. On the other hand, Mr. Putin has no problems sending troops and arms into the Ukraine, expecting the Western countries to do nothing more than talk. So we find ourselves stuck in-between two successive U.S. administrations, one, under President Bush, all too willing to use American force, and one under President Obama tilted too much towards the safety of inaction. Given all of this, I would lean towards Mr. Cohen's view, and provide arms to the Ukrainian troops. Will that action accomplish what we want? Probably not, but doing nothing will definitely not.","Can someone provide a single example of diplomacy resolving a military conflict in the last 20 years? It hasn't worked with North Korea, it hasn't brought about any change in Cuba, it hasn't had any impact on Mr. Putin's actions. If diplomacy means simply saying that the Crimea and Donetsk are part of Russia, and that the remainder of the Ukraine is not an independent country but a Russian vassal state, then sure diplomacy works. But if that is not the desired outcome, we have to do something different. Why is it OK for Mr.  Putin to send weapons and soldiers into the Ukraine (but of course to deny doing so), but for the Western powers, anything more than words is war mongering? Would we take an active role in defending any of the Eastern European countries, and if so, what makes them different?","This is typical diplomatic double-talk: in reality there is no agreement other than to give Russia what it wants. Mr. Putin now has an autonomous Russian vassal, but does not have to pay for it, since it is technically still part of the Ukraine. He continues to deny that this autonomy' was gained by the use of Russian military force. Ultimately he succeeds because he is willing to use military force, while we in the West shy away from any military commitment...Unfortunately the lesson of the Ukraine is heard by other nations as well. The ongoing negotiation with Iran over their development of nuclear weapons is colored by the knowledge that even in Iran, the West will shy away from any military commitment.",Putin will protect his naval base in Syria at all costs. Just as he did in Ukraine. Makes one wonder if Obama targeted Assad for the same reason he targeted Ukraine.
Matt,,,,"An important step, yes, but not nearly the same as having people stationed there full time.  The real reason there are more than 25,000 uniformed Americans in South Korea right now is NOT because they would make much of a difference in an invasion.  Rather, their presence is a signal the North cannot ignore that the US would automatically be involved in any war right from the start...Would Putin have dared grab Crimea if thousands of US soldiers had been on the ground there?",I don't like Putin but this appears to be the Realpolitik of the situation: Putin is gambling that the West has no stomach for this fight and so far it looks like he made the right call (from his perspective). These sanctions are weak and toothless and it appears the West just wants this to fade away. Obama and other Western leaders are embarrassing themselves by continuing this theatre. Just my cynical perspective.,"Putin's goal is to destabilize and ultimately overthrow the Ukrainian government. The cease fire agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. As bad as this situation is, Ukraine is of little strategic importance to the U.S., and is certainly not worth going to war with Russia over. If Russia were to threaten a NATO member either directly or through proxies, that would be a provocation that could not be ignored. I disagree with those who see Ukraine as a foreign policy failure by Obama. What scares me more are people like John McCain and other trigger-happy conservatives who would have us go to war even when our strategic interests are not threatened.","...Only if leading your country to economic ruin is a form of leadership.....Which, incidentally, is something that the GOP has excelled at since the days of Reagan and culminating in the financial crisis of 2007-2008. We are still living with the fallout from that as middle-class incomes stagnate and shrink and income inequality becomes so severe that it is a national weakness...While I agree with your description of Putin as a delusional thug, the US faces many of the same economic issues that Russia does. Russia has oligarchs who have massive influence with the government and the US has corporations and the ultra-rich that buy politicians wholesale...Let's face it: Putin and Dick Cheney are two sides of the same coin. Part of what made Iraq such a disaster was that our claim to moral leadership was undermined severely by waging a war of aggression in Iraq and using torture, which is still defended in some quarters...While we can and should stand against Putinism, we need to realize that we don't exactly have clean hands and that complicates our task immensely.","If there are limits to her rapport, I'm sure the fault lies with Merkel. And not the former KGB, opposition-killing, press-torturing, Chechnyan-suppressing megalomaniac that Putin is. It's only really been George W. Bush, remember, who could really look into Putin's eyes, and see something kind. The rest of the world, or a majority of it, might be more in touch with reality.","What you say makes sense Mr. Friedman.  We need to contain Putin in his expansionist zeal.  But there is a danger for being too eager. Globally speaking, Russia is a political, economic, and cultural force to reckon with.  It is a global asset that we can ill-afford to undermine and weaken. Weakening Russia has ripple effects, detrimental to the world.","Yes, on top of this there is the issue that the U.S. immediately insults the fragile Geneva agreement with fresh threats against Russia.  Doesn't sound like the U.S. is acting in good faith here..That's why it has been the intention of the U.S. from the very beginning to provoke a civil war in Ukraine, in the hopes of drawing in a Russian intervention.  But Russia will only intervene on the basis of Putin's stated policy, to protect Russian minorities in neighboring countries.  That would only happen in the face of massacres approaching the Syrian scale, where Putin would lose face in the non-enforcement of his policy. He'll simply point to NATO in Kosovo and Libya as precedent..Fortunately that hasn't happened - yet.  Putin has followed a cautious, obviously preplanned course: quickly grab the valuable piece (Crimea) and take it off the table (Geneva), then sit back, encourage the creation of facts on the ground (Donetsk), knowing that in the face of counterinsurgency the insurgents are easily supplied and succored across the Russian border.  This will expose the real U.S. policy of promoting the division of Ukraine, promoting the West while demonizing (and assisting inactive suppression) of the East..All those who belittle the Donetsk separatists as minor bands have to face this:  The Donetsk events don't as yet manifest mass support for the separatists, but neither are these insignificant in number.  Any armed suppression by Kiev will have to KILL alot of people.","That is exactly Putin's gambit, to draw the Kiev coup gov't (and behind it, the U.S. who has obviously been closely supporting it, putting down a massive 24x7 propaganda barrage for its benefit) into a bloody counterinsurgency war in the East, one that could be infinitely supplied from across the Russian border.  The U.S. perhaps hoped to bait Russia into an invasion, but it looks like the bear baiter has stepped into his own trap!  Now the U.S. has to appear to support the militarized repression of one's own people (CIA Director and all), has to lay down a propaganda barrage demonizing the Donetsk separatists, and so forth. It will only get worse as the gas deliveries and IMFEU austerity hit home. Putin might be callously using the Dontsk separatists as pawns (yes), but one must admit that he's not a dummy!..Fortunately the Ukrainian military units sent by the Kiev gov't refused to implement the counterinsurgency - one of them, an airborne brigade, deserting and subsequently disbanded.  ..The U.S. propaganda barrage provided cover in this case by praising the restraint of Kiev.  LOL.  Powerlessness  restraint.  ..This follows the general propaganda MO of the USG, whose spokespersons anxiously scurry to the mike on every occasion to shout that war is peace, ignorance is strength, A  !A.  Pure Orwell, 24x7.","This is a disturbing, albeit well-done, column. Messianic autocrats with a sense of destiny often turn out quite bad for the world...If Russia does indeed evolve into a nation that is abnormal and immune to the carrots and sticks of traditional diplomacy, this is going to put US and EU policymakers in a world of hurt in trying to contain Putin...Anyway, so much for the pivot to Asia. Ignoring Europe is something we do at our peril. The greatest difficulty in all this is that Ukraine really has no intrinsic geopolitical significance to the United States. The same cannot be said for the nations of the EU, which not only are in close physical proximity to this, but also highly dependent on Russian natural gas supplies that cross through Ukraine...It's enough to make one feel a certain nostalgia for the bad old days of the Cold War and the USSR which, as bad as it was, at least had some semblance of rationality in its foreign policymaking owing in part to being led by a generation that lived through World War Two and saw the butcher's bill that conflict had for the Soviet Union...This also gives new relevance to the NATO alliance and the US obligation to aid in the defense of member nations threatened with attack. Four NATO members have a border with Ukraine: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. If Angela Merkel was right that Putin is out of touch with reality, the direction this could go starts to look really, really ugly. And Russia remains a formidable nuclear power.","The territorial integrity of Ukraine has been violated by an overt Russian military deployment on a pretense that blatantly disregards the principal of internal affairs and Ukraine's sovereign authority to protect its own citizens.  There could not be a more obvious act of disregard of the established international order by Vladimir Putin, and yet the Europeans (Germans) will still do anything to make nice and keep playing his game.  ..Until Germany is willing to tell Putin that he is a bad man and should be ashamed of himself, he will win every game he plays.  I know it sounds like a farce, but they aren't willing to speak out in the world about Putin's awful behaviour, and if we cannot be honest about obvious facts there is no hope of rectifying injustice.  ..The United States cannot take unilateral action against Russia.  Until Europe speaks with a unified voice, Obama must remain aloof, or else this confrontation could rapidly escalate into a direct test of NATO against Russian aggression, which would likely lead to the final disgrace of the Alliance admitting it is powerless to act, since open war in Crimea would be no solution and an attack on Russian territory to cripple their military strategy would be provocation for nuclear war...Of course, the only nuclear bomb that might go off in this contest is Russian gas, and if that gets turned off the Germans will be kicking Merkel out of office and electing Putin God-Emperor of the Rhineland."
Vlad-Drakul,,,,"'PS See how many PutinBots you can spot in these comments. They aren't paid very well, but it's the only work they can get right now.''..Another example not only of empty accusations and cowardice but lies. Shoot the messenger and ignore the counter evidence because the USA is as always as pure as the driven snow. Ignore Odessa, Ignore the Nazis going to fight for the Fascist Ukraine oligarchy. The 'suicide's of ex government Officials, the use of artillery and bombing of FELLOW UKRAINIANS, the lie that only Russians are fighting in the Ukraine..  The not ever being released 'proof' that it was the rebels who shot down the Malaysian airplane over the Ukraine because the evidence we hoped would prove 'Putin has blood on his hands' has proven either not conclusive or more likely that it was Ukrainian soldiers who shot down the airplane. Nope we get silence just as we do on the slaughters at Odessa and the Confederate flag, Celtic crosses and swastika's waving Azov and Right Sektor real Nazis, the massacres, the assaults on Jews and fellow Ukrainians in Minsk that ARE reported in Haaretz and other newspapers but not here.. I am not a Putinbot and do not like Putin (too authoritarian) but that is no excuse for the bigotry that is the main argument used to demonize Russia (serfs, mindless conformists used to tsarism, Communism etc) and ignore uncomfortable facts of history and the actual events of our meddling and intrigue (Hunter Biden, John McCains position in new Ukraine Gov)","'If he is not careful, Mr. Putin may end up facing exactly what he has railed against  a NATO more firmly parked on Russias borders  not because the alliance wanted to go in that direction, but because Russian behavior left it little choice.''. I am not going to bother going through a list of all the all too many facts that prove this to be a white wash as I will not get printed but I will say that it is only in the USA that the opinion that Russia is 100 guilty is accepted. This is due to a return to compact propaganda of the type that gave us Iraq and Vietnam.. No the most popular comments by writers such as Critical Rationalist are one's of uncritical irrationality based on insights he gains on 'the Russian character' or his personal insights on 'Mr Putin , who personifies arrogance...has succeeded in a system that scorns honesty....thus in the West his claims that there was a 'coup' in the Ukraine..'. So did the West react to Russian aggression or Russia to ours?? Well according to the UK Guardian's older articles this all began long BEFORE the Ukraine Crises;.'Poland reluctant to give America sovereignty over missile base'  the G. 7th July 2006.'Us and Poland agree to missile defense deal' the G. 14th August 2008.'Thaws and tensions in missile defense Simon Tisdall'  the G 17th sept 2009. So these Western articles prove we started this. So instead we get no facts, no analysis just thought reading, anti Russian bigotry and dogma. So not 'rational and critical'!","As always on this most shameful and stupid policy of Russian humiliation, we get yet another article that does not even attempt to be more than 100 propaganda. No mention of the many things known to anyone who has made any attempt to follow this terrible development with any level of objectivity..  Everything is 100 Russian fault and everyone on our side is as pure as the driven snow. Nothing about Hunter Biden, nothing about John McCain and Blackwater mercenaries. Nothing about the massacres at Odessa (80 burned alive; I've seen the videos and believe my eye's) Mariupol, No comments on those who fight a government founded on a very violent coup against a democratic elected government; just as we support a torture loving death sentence wielding brutal dictatorship in Egypt and Honduras..   Nothing about the politicians of the past elected government dying or 'committing suicide'. Nothing about Nulands plans for who were to be Ukraine leaders BEFORE Maiden, Or the now dropped accusations against Putin of 'having blood on his hands' over the downed airplane over Ukraine of which we hear nothing about anymore, as the evidence is now not mentioned, as it does NOT prove Putin guilty, although no apologies will be heard.. Just as with Muslims we now have the Russians as the scapegoat for all evil. We have a press in Iraq war like lockstep but even worse than in 2001-4 we do not even get our polite letter printed in newspapers one once had faith in and respect for like the NYT.","You accuse those who differ with your ignorant opinion as being paid ' a nice fat pay check from Comrade Putin to lie and spread hatred' without any evidence of this but your own prejudice and anti intellectualism (facts, logic, whats' that??)..  Yet your letter gets printed. and so the tone of this once great paper descends into FOX land where 'unpatriotic opinions' are insulted and abused rather than argued with. It fits n this era of Whistle blower hunting (Snowdon, Assange) in which the greatest terror and threat to the 'free West' is 'wrong opinions'.  Pathetic","Putin has the blood of Malaysian Flight 17 on his bloody hands. Putin has the blood of 298 people on MH17. Nothing he or his trolls can say would ever change that..  No the 'trolls' won't need to say anything. They and you should wait fo rt eevidence that we were supposed ot hear last year but because the evidence now does not show Rebel involvement but Ukrainian so we don't hear about it anymore because our premature (before evidence) accusations were wrong.If the evidence DID prove Russian involvement we would have heard about it by now..  And even if you were not factually wrong Putin would STILL not be any more responsible for a mistake made by a Ukrainian rebel than any of our leaders are when they like John McCain sold weapons that are now wielded by ISIS..  You make a desperate point that lacking logic says far more about you than about Russia, Putin or these so called trolls","Like so many of your generation you have gone soft and drifted into irrelevance and conformism. You are SO wrong about your assumptions and misreading of history. You must have slept since the 1970's..  You talk about isolationism as though we have not been actively aggressive and warlike in the last decades and have not attempted to isolate Russia and punish it for not dying after the collapse of the USSR. AS though we don't support torture dictatorships, as though we don't start lie based wars and grow bases all around the world.  AS though we don't lie about missile put into Poland, Estonia, Latvia etc to ''target Iran' back in 2007 (ie long before Ukraine)..   Must be Putin's fault. just like OUR support to the home of jihad (Saudia Arabia) even while OUR weapons end up in the hands of ISIS (thanks John McCain) while we wreck whole nations (Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Columbia)..  Go back to sleep!","Parallel??? ..The Poles were NOT killing Germans and Hitler was interested in World War 2 and ethnic cleansing (genocide) using the faked attacks (Germans dressed as Poles to create a 'casus belli' where as Putin is reacting to a murderous coup that destroyed a democracy and plunged an nation into civil war with most of the killing coming from our 'good guys'...The real Nazis are in the Ukraine; they wear SS regalia  and talk about exterminating the 'Russians' who are their own fellow Ukrainians. The Ukrainian army mostly switched sides when sent east and so the 'good guy's' need private armies, 'Freikorps' Nazis and ex Blackwater hired killers to spearhead their attacks on civilian targets...This is the US starting another Syrian this time in Europe and using Nazis as the proxies. Nothing about the Oligarch Poroshenko or Hunter Bidens position in charge of Ukraine energy resources is printed here. So your prejudice and lies get help from the same propaganda set up that gave us Iraq, Libya, Syria. Vietnam and millions of 'lesser' human being getting murdered (we love our psycho killers like 'Sniper Kyle' (whose death was poetic justice in it's manner)..   'It appears that Putin re-read the history books and is following the Nazi script' you say. Why would he do that when he is fighting Nazi's. And if the Rusians are so wrong why are they not slaughtering civilians in the Crimea like the Ukraine Government we support does?? Perhaps because we are on the wrong side!","While my letters to the NYT on other issues get printed, it worries me that my letters on this issue rarely do.. Let's start with the headline 'Mr. Putin resumes his war in Ukraine'. This sounds as if the entire problem is a Russian created one with the US playing no role in this at all. This reality denial is mirrored in the earlier Soro's article printed here, which if read by anyone from Europe would be dismissed as pure propaganda of the most crude sort.. One only has to read the comments on the increasingly center right (ex leftie) UK Guardian where although the editorial line is the same as the US one; the comments by readers despite being very right wing on other issues , such as Muslims, immigration and 'fighting terror' is firmly in the 'stop lying to us about Ukraine' column..   It mirrors the change in tone of comments on the IsraelPalestinian one here at the NYT. The majority of readers here now reject the pro Israeli line; as the ObamaNetanayu feud has given space for various view points (as on the Cuban issue). This is healthy and part of what makes democracy democracy rather than half truths used to form public opinion rather than inform or reflect it.   So in Europe the clampdown by the Elite on 'unwanted opinions' has worked to stop meaningful criticism of Islamophobia ('We are Charlie' by the 'don't let Muslims preach hate' free speech hypocrits) while in the US the 'compact press refuse to allow any view other than that the Ukraine is 'Putins War'.","I agree with Soros on some things too (Weed legalization and other things) but the idea that you should change your mind merely because he writes something is wrong. He has his powerful interests to consider and remembering how he manipulated the money market for his own best interests ought to warn you that he is anything BUT a objective viewer on this issue..  I do agree with you looking more into the details and highly recommend that you do so and look at all the info out there. The more you look however the more you will see he is wrong on this. Very wrong as this is our biggest mistake since VIetnam (ie even worse than Iraq ;a new unnecessary Cold war; good only for arms producers)..  Ever since Putin made Russia trong again the US in particular has done everything to hurt Russia, Cheap oil to ruin their economy, Missile encirclement. Dropping Salt II, moving NATO eastwards after promising not to; blaming Russia fro the US initiated Georgian aggression and now our support for an anti democratic coup in the Ukraine. '.  Notice how we support democracy and freedom except when we don't, Egypt, and Honduras (where we initially stated we would NOT recognize their Government but then went on to be close and destructive partners with the same Government tyranny. We 'fight' Jihad and yet support it (Saudia Arabia, Al Nusrah; al Quaida etc;.   The only principles 'we' truly follow is what is good for our Elites Oligarchy. And that IS something George Soros will get behind",
Jay Casey,,,,Who are the Western business leaders who attended Putin's event?  Please name them and their companies so we can boycott them.,This is so illogical on Putin's part.  Even Sweden is now deciding to boost its military spending to counter Russian aggression.  Russians are simply hardening the West's opposition.  Conservative pundits are talking up Putin as a real leader in contrast to Obama when in reality they should be glad we have a smart leader that thinks several steps down the road.  Putin is acting like a reckless fool in contrast.,"Usually, leaders of state at least try to avoid outright lies with skillful obfuscation. Putin doesn't even try. He just lies.","We should listen to Ambassador McFaul closely.  His suggestions on the way forward make sense.  I just regret that our country, led by Cheney and Bush, squandered our moral authority with Iraq - a terrible, costly mistake we will pay for for years.  But with time and corrective action we can repair the damage.  It may take a generation.  In a generation maybe Putin will be gone too.",Putin may be stubborn and vindictive but he will be taken down and he will most likely rue the day he crossed the line and dismissed the opinion of the international community.

Rog: Everything you say about Putin's Russia can be said of Iran 10-fold, whether it's looking back on the mythical glories of the 7th Century when their beloved 12th Iman disappeared supposedly to return and usher in a new age of world Islam Shiite style, to leaning on nukes, to irrational losers behavior demonstrated by their sponsorship of terror and the latest hardening position on the nuclear deal a naive Obama has been offering them flawed in their favor from the get-go.  Yet your brain turns to mush every time someone points this out about Iran.  Instead, you need to sluff it off with Netanyahu-bashing (not withstanding the fact the the left candidate Isaac Herzog is no less adamant about the weakness of the Iran nuclear deal).  It's as if your visceral dislike of Benjamin Netanyahu puts your brain circuits on hold.","Putin brought this on himself. When Medvedev was his stand-in president, the Russians didn't have any problem with those former Soviet captive countries joining NATO, and relations were good with Russia.  Why suddenly now?  And are you saying nations like Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania don't have good reason to be less than enthusiastic for having Russia as their immediate neighbor?","The delay in applying sanctions (so that Russians and American investors can move their money) and the limited scope show that this is a fig leaf.  Europe and the US are somewhere between ineffectual and complicit in this.   I think it is money talking - rich politicians and their backers wanting to preserve their financial interests while pretending to waggle their finger at Russia...The Crimean move was a test and the US failed.   Crimea was always essentially part of Russia so Russia could be confident that even a decisive and effective US would not ultimately stop them (but would have instead extracted serious concessions).  However, they now know that the US is pathetic and ineffectual - driven by money and self-interest when it is driven at all.   ..The scary part is what happens next -- what will Putin do next to raise nationalist sentiment and cement his power.   Peace in our time.","Sanctions on eleven people-- what next, un-friending Putin on Facebook? Weak sanctions accomplished nothing when South Ossetia and Abkhazia were annexed by Russia, rendering Georgia ineligible for NATO or EU because of disputed borders. By annexing parts of the countries around  him, Putin is creating buffer states crippled from full entry into the international system. The United States and EU should unite, ignore the cost to those who unwisely invested in a dictator-run country and impose effective sanctions, boycotts and travel bans.","The USSR certainly looked dominant too in 1979 when it invaded and conquered Afghanistan a few short years after a humbled United States withdrew the last of its personnel from Saigon bowing to the inevitable defeat there, with 53,000 American lives lost, and years and trillions of dollars wasted. Yet, the Russians ended up humiliated there, its people fed up, and ten years later the Soviet Union was no more...Putin may seem dominating and clever now.  But let's see how he fares in front of the Russian people a year or two from now after the first Russian soldiers are killed by jihadi suicide bombers or are beheaded or burned alive on camera for the world to see by Islamic State. Then strong-man Putin will be left with two choices: pull Russia out of Syria with the formerly strong-man's tail between his legs or go in deeper refusing to bow to the humiliation inflicted by ISIS.  And if Afghanistan 1979-89 is a guide, that won't turn out well for Putin either.","The irony here is, though there is certainly an antisemitic current within many of these Far Right parties -- particularly Jobbik in Hungary, Putin himself has shown no antisemitism.  On the contrary, he has publicly praised the contributions of Russian Jews to the nation, and is on good terms with Israel.  He even used the specter of antisemitism as one of his justifications for facing off with the Ukrainian government over Crimea, which includes the antisemitic Svoboda Party in its coalition government. Meanwhile, the most violent antisemitic acts perpetrated in Europe in recent days especially in France have been committed by North African Muslim Arab immigrants -- not Far Rightists or neo-Nazis.  Yet it is the European Left that defends continued immigration (read Arabs from North Africa in particular) into Europe which of course the Far Right is vehemently opposed to.  As Sir Walter Scott observed: oh, what a tangled web we weave.",,,,
JP,,,,"@slartibartfast:Good grief, give it up already. Putin invaded Georgia when Bush was president. ..Good grief, was there a signed agreement guaranteeing Georgia's territorial integrity?.WJC singed one with respect to Ukraine after they gave up their nukes.","I'll take Obama's decision to work with allies and manage risks, over George W. Bush's decision to unilaterally waste massive amounts of capital and blood in a place like Iraq -- effectively turning half of the country -- and a large part of its oil production, over to Iran, and creating new operating space for groups like ISIL.  Additionally that massive focus of attention and resources didn't exactly aid the U.S. in other parts of the globe.  Also, Putin didn't exactly seem disuaded by George W. Bush's toughness when it came to invading Georgia.","Yes, this is all Americas fault. We've heard that before like a sad broken record. That's a get out of jail free card used by corrupt dictators since the beginning of the last century. Unlike how it is in Russia where Putin controls all of the media, here in the US, trying to disseminate your propaganda is going to be a little tough.","Conversation only works if the parties have shared objectives and the willingness to negotiate in good faith...If one side feels it is able to obtain its objectives by force, it won't negotiate in good faith.  Also, if one sides objective is to take land belonging to another country, where is the middle point in that negotiation?..The United States has an obligation to look at a diplomatic path.  But it is clear based on Putin's history that there is no partner to negotiate with on this issue on the Russian side.  He is determined to split Ukraine and he also has a target on part of Moldova.  Then what?",Got it.  So Putin is correct in Crimea and the US was correct in Vietnam and Iraq..Loved calculus.,,,,,
lawrence donohue,,,,"Putin has played very well in some Western media, including you know who..The earliest reports were that the Eastern Ukraine was a Russian enclave..(That was corrected the next day after the former US ambassador to Russia shed some light on it.)  The same media referred to Russian troops as.Ukrainian sympathizers.  That media continues to refer to the current Ukrainian government as coming to power as a result of an illegal revolt..We will never know how much this reporting encouraged Putin.  Nor will we know how much the I can be more flexible after the reelection(paraphrasing) remark encouraged Putin..The Western powers must be absolutely clear to Putin that they will never stand by while Russia attempts to absorb The Ukraine.","You fail to understand Ukrainian history.  They lost millions of people during and after WW II at the hands of Hitler and Stalin.  They remember those atrocities..It is they who are fighting for freedom, not the West. Even if Putin was more diplomatic they would fight him.  We should always support their struggle.","The dumbest thing that any president has ever said is:  After the election, I can be more flexible. Obama said this to Putin.  Since then, Putin has invaded The Ukraine twice and sent troops to Syria..Obama should not talk to Putin ever again..The Iran deal did not work out well..I suggest that the US withdraw all its diplomats.","Russia has no legimate interests in the Ukraine.  To say that Putin must protect all Russian speakers, is to bring us back to 1939. Putin would like to change the end of WW II and make the Ukraine part of Russia.  The Ukraine was the bone that Stalin and Hitler fought over.  Putin does not want to let go.  The Ukrainians remember WW II and the atrotocies by Stalin and Hitler and will fight to avoid them again..Europe must convince Putin that it will not allow Putin to dominate.","This is a continuation of WW II when Stalin sought to extend the territory of the Soviet Union.  At that time it resulted in the Great Terror, ethnic cleansing and the removal of millions of civilians to Golages.  Stalin's model is there.  Will Putin follow it to the letter?  The West should presume that he will.  For the sake of humanity, the West should do everything possible to stop him.","The dumbest thing that Obama ever said was: After I get reelected, I can be more flexible. He said this to Putin.  Since then Putin invaded the Crimea and The Ukraine 3 times.  Putin knows that Obama will not fight him, so he can execute his wish list. After Obama negotiated Peace with Iran with much fanfare, Putin overrides Obama's treaty with his own treaty with Iran..The US has been rendered powerless. What will Putin do next?","This is a continuation of WW II. Millions of Ukraineians died at the hands of Hitler and Stalin. Putin knows that the World will not accept a Putin solution to this problem.  Although many in the Eastern part of that country speak Russian, there is no evidence that they want to be part of Russia. On the contrary, the evidence is that Putin has sent armed thugs to get him a foothold..It is very important that all of Ukraine remain free.  Putin should be isolated and sanction should be imposed by the West.","This is not a civil war. Many Ukrainians had parents who died at the hands of the Soviets during WW II.  They will fight to avoid Russian control again..Putin is trying to change the outcome of WW II by annexing the Ukraine, which the Soviets did in WW II.  He is finding that the Ukrainains have long memories..But Putin must also remember the fall of the Soviets.  It could happen to him.","The history of genocide in the Ukraine by the Soviets was so extensive that Putin cannot ignore it. Stalin killed countless millions from 1932 through 1990..Many of the Russian speakers were transplants during this horrific period.  Kiev can not tolerate any defense of these atrocities. Peace can only come to the Ukraine when all the Russians are gone.  Obviouly, the people of the Ukraine will not allow vestiges of the Soviet era to remain.","Putin, like Stalin, wants to control the Ukraine.  But it will be very expensive..Most Ukrainians remember the millions that were lost before, during and after.WW II.  Putin would like to take the Ukraine without incurring the cost. The West must show Putin how expensive it will be, militarily and economically.  Apparently, the Ukrainians are ready to fight.  Lets hope that Putin is reasonable and understands the cost of taking Ukraine."
JL,,,,"I don't see what has happened post crash as demonstrating the degree of control Putin has. I doubt he cares whether the victims' belongings are looted or if they are interred properly and in a reasonable time frame. ..If he's playing a long game, this is probably actually helpful to him. Since there will be less usable, uncontaminated evidence at the crash scene, whatever the finding, people will have grounds to doubt it. And the idea that the rebels are so disorganized, Putin must not be control him, can only help Putin as the rebels continue to do terrible things.","Tom, it is striking how nave you are.  If you think that Obama is going to do anything meaningful to challenge Putin you are, as tcarl said in his post, still dreaming.  You have learned nothing from Egypt, Syria and Libya.  Obama wants them all to just go away.","It's alarming how many NY Times readers are eager for war and confrontation and buy whole cloth the narrative that Putin is the bad guy and the Kiev government the good guys.  Remember this conflict was triggered by the mob overthrowing a democratically elected president in Ukraine.  Our US State Department was involved as demonstrated by the taped conversation of Under Secretary Nuland and US Ambassador Pyatt where they are heard plotting the succession in Kiev.  The coup occurred while the world was in Sochi and Putin preoccupied with his hosting duties at the Winter Olympics.  The Games over, Russia sprang into counter-offensive mode to ensure its naval base in Crimea and to support the Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine who had legitimate concerns re the Revanchist Kiev government.  The USEUNATO has fueled the fire by encouraging Kiev to settle the situation -- i.e., crush the Russian speakers of the east.  Russia has kept that from occurring and has repeatedly pushed for a negotiated settlement.  The current ceasefire and talks are a hopeful step and should be encouraged by all parties.",,,,,,,
terry brady,,,,"To worry about Mr. Putin and Russia is akin to watching ice cream melt.  Sorting out Europe East or West is likewise silly because it is the broke countries cussing the bankrupt ones.  Over the next decade the EU, NATO and Eastern Europe must figure out the tedious balance of having and keeping productive citizens and how to grow economies without inducing catastrophic joblessness amid global competition.  Putin's Russia is a passing personal fancy as opposed to true expansion and ruthlessness because there is more power in The City of London and NYC on any Wednesday afternoon that has even been amassed in Russia.  Russia is more so connected to global finiance than any Nationalism or delusions of grandure from Mr. Putin.","Bloodshed seems assured because no one has any aces or money.  But, it is interesting that the fightseems to get arms and cash.  Making things clear to Mr. Putin now matters little as the fistfuls of hate have been unleashed along geographic ideology and identity. Making sense out of East or West sentiments is always a bloody conversation.","Diplomatic brilliance is when your nose is growing longer but you still look menacing: hail almighty Putin.  Seriously though, Putin is one steady-handed politico.  What, my speciality troops in the Ukraine must have happened by mistake.  That is very rich:  The boys are really poor at geography and boarder crossings.  Not to worry, we'll cancel passes and amend their orders using GPS coordinates instead of turn left at the barking dog.","The problem with geopolitical upper-hand gamesmanship is the armament factor, of which --  both East and West are dangerously weaponized.  Mr. Putin is far too heavily invested in Russian History and Europe and America are similarly, Cold-War chest-beaters.  As history teaches dumb things happen too easily and frequently.  The region is set for a period that resembles infamous times and uncertainly.","Alternatively, the idea of not being able to afford his boneheaded move led Mr. Putin to pick up the phone.  Strangely, the UN vote moved the dial and then Russia decided the time was not NOW.",Mr. Putin is no dummy and his bread is always buttered.  He is the boss until he is put into his glass coffin. The Russian citizenry love him dearly and he enjoys going to work regardless.,"The decline is old, older than Putin and Mr. Friedman. In the last 60 years everything in the region began to disassemble and crumble.  Spurts of oil money and the selling off of National Industries and treasure were bubbles of ordinary proportion.  The citizen are broke or bankrupted due to debt or inflation.  The only solution is for Russia to join NATO and thereby negate the need for the treaty.",Not to be a told you so either but Mr. Putin stepped on his ding-dong with this boneheaded move on Crimea due to close at hand economics and National treasure.  He cannot afford the move and he cannot upset what little international commerce Russia enjoys beyond oil. The demise of the Soviet Union was an economicproductivity collapse due to extensive geographic reach and ambition.  Ideology has nothing to do with geopolitical motivation once the budget is included and going broke is going broke.,"To play the devil's advocate Mr. Putin seeks the glory days when the image of the Soviet Union was untarnished and robust (although mostly hiding a National bankruptcy).  The question is can he amalgamate the Ukraine psyche as fully Russian without tanks and masked gunmen.  Doubtfully.  So, Mr. Obama and NATO might give him more rope to hang himself because he might just jump.","Indeed correct, Russia and Putin is only as good as the USA says so.  It is sad but true that unless or until you are in favor of POTUS, the USA networks, Holloywood and Main Street, you're nothing.  So, take away their standing and they fold because they drew a pair of duces."
Randy,,,,"So many of these anti-Obama comments are laughable. ..If anyone thinks W or anyone else could've stopped Putin they are delusional. You can't have it both ways. If we're going to start wars under false pretenses and fly drones over threatening areas, then Russia has the right to protect its strategic warm-water port...And to those who argue for intervention and make comparisons to Germany in the 1930s, I say false analogy and put yourself on the front line if you're so desperate to fight. Thank God we don't have President Romney or McCain starting yet another pointless conflict just to appease their friends and supporters in the military-industrial complex.","stu- You sanitized the quote from the article by removing the term 'iron-fisted' before the word grip which, of course, makes Putin seem more like an everyday street-fighting local American politician rather than the absolute dictator that he is. Why is that?","Putin is moving to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine's 'Sudetenland' ; after all, they require lebensraum.

History does repeat itself.",,,,,,,

Russia was never even punished for the brutal occupation of Eastern Europe and 50 years of cold war.  It is in the worlds interest to keep him from even thinking about reassembling it.,Putin is dead wrong!   The break up of the Soviet Union is the BEST thing that happened in the last century.

JJ,,,,"Thanks for making the point about Germany's dependence on Russian energy exports so clearly. ..Germany's energy politics are a universal example of what not to do.  ..Switching off the safest nuclear power plants in the world out of misguided ideology, while trying to convert 50 of the national energy supply to intermittent renewables, primarily wind (solar won't make much of contribution in Germany), almost immediately, with no transmission lines in place is pure lunacy.  Everything, absolutely everthing in Germany now hinges on Putin not closing the gas pipes.  If he does, the economy will collapse and the country will go dark...Merkel has as much negotiating power with Putin as a poodle has against an angry Doberman.",,,,,,,,,
Counter Measures,,,,"Perhaps, Mr. Putin is starting to feel oligarchitis withdrawal!","History means nothing anymore! Just a reminder, a large segment of the Ukrainians fielded over five ruthless army divisions in support of the Nazis during World War II. Certainly Putin is no Saint, and is acting more and more like a tyrant lately! But these present day Ukrainians, are no leaders in the ideas of democracy, either. And to these new supposedly comrades, I say, despite some of your past efforts, we are still here, and remember! And Happy New Year, 5775 to those that do!","Though Patton wanted to slug it out with these guys (when Nuclear annihilation was not an issue!) at the end of WWII, when we had the manpower on the ground, we have barked at each other over the years, by we as a nation, have never actually gone to war against the Russians... Look, they have a history of being ruled by thugs, whether it was the Mongols, Czars, Commnists, and now Putin's ilk. They are a humorless people, with lousy geography, and rivers, which mostly run north to south, rather than the more trade friendly, west to east! They are a grim people through no fault of their own. The question remains, how do we deal with these people, and you kind of wonder if the guys immediately around Putin, will at some point say, this is enough! Yet he seems ot be like a benevolent dictaor to his own people, and it remains to be seen if they will ever get fed up with him?!",,,,,,,
Stephen,,,,Will the countries where the weaponry and minuscule forces be deployed feel any more secure as a result?  I doubt it.  Will it raise the stakes vis--vis Russia and the West?  Undoubtedly.  If Putin leads Russia for another ten years he will have outlasted at least four US presidents and more than four secretaries of state andor defense.  He knows where he is going and we don't know where we are going.  This is grandstanding of the most dangerous and provocative kind.,"Whatever has been lost is not likely to be regained either diplomatically or militarily.  Putin is smart enough to know that he doesn't really need Kiev, if he gets enough in Western Ukraine the rump that survives in the East will be weak enough that it will not be able to do anything about this fair accompli.  As for the rest of us we had better hope that a similar scenario is not played out elsewhere, especially in the Baltic republics.","The question to be asked is when will the separatists and Vladimir Putin be satisfied?  Will they feel it necessary to go as far as Kiev?  This is a civil war with one side strongly supported by the armed might of Russia.  I don't think Kiev will accept partition. Likewise, Putin will only accept a government in Kiev that will seek greater Russian hegemony if not outright rule.  The Baltic states that have significant Russian minorities had better watch out.","Putin has revealed himself as a true Slavophile and treats his opponents as westernizers.  This has been a conflict in Russia since the time of Peter the Great.  Recognizing this perpetual split in the Russian psyche Cohen has laid out the necessity of a framework for dealing with Russian paranoia.  Mind you, that paranoia has been well marked by the numerous invasions of Russia from the West over the centuries as well.  Western reaction will be slow because we are democracies, Putin can do what he likes, he's not accountable to anybody.","Give those Russians credit! They know their history.  78 years ago the leader of the Leningrad Communists (Kirov) was assassinated and the Great Purge began.  Well, this time no one was assassinated but Putin will use this as an excuse to clamp down harder.",Does this surprise anybody?  It might surprise George W. Bush who thought he could read Putin's eyes very well but it probably wouldn't have surprised Ronald Reagan.,"Sanctions only work when everybody participates in them.  In 1935 Mussolini invaded Ethiopia.  The League of Nations proposed sanctions, especially of oil..The USA, not a member of the League, continued to send oil.  For a time Mussolini conquered Ethiopia but shortly after the Italians entered World War Two the British took it back from him and the country regained its freedom. So with Russia and Ukraine. Putin will have his way because no effective sanction exists to prevent it.",Giving Ukraine military equipment will not win the war for them.  If anything it would create a military victory for the Russians and their ability to dictate the terms of peace.  In other words this would play directly into Putin's hands.  He will probably get his way eventually and the settlement will not be good for Kiev or Europe or America.  Sorry to be so cynical but the bear's claws are very sharp and Kiev will have to settle for what it can get and neither Europe nor America will have any effective say in what is rapidly becoming an internal Russian matter.,"It seems to me that the question now becomes if the autonomy vote carries who will recognize the political entity created?' Look at the Turks in Cyprus, only the Turks in Ankara recognize them. Putin will give recognition as well and establish a military alliance and Kiev will have lost a significant chunk of its economy and its geography.",This time Obama did not box himself in as he did in Syria but if the Russians chose to do something drastic what could America do? Recall its ambassador is one option. Place significant NATO troops in Poland? Not likely. In this rat's nest there are no easy solutions either to dissuade the Russians or persuade the Ukrainians. I think Putin knows this and will stretch his hands to grab what he can and defy the west to do anything to remove them.

The big banks that are pulling all the strings really wanted Crimea, to cut Russia off from it, so they can putt missiles there and encircle Russia. Their ultimate goal is to loot Ukraine, Russia and China to prop up their bankrupt financial system. ..Just like back in 2003, the western media lied and told everyone that Saddam had WMD, now they're doing the same with Putin and Russia.","Putin didn't start the aggression towards Ukraine, it started with the U.S. State Department's Victoria Nuland and Obama's financial backing of fascist Nazis such as the Right Sector. Also, for the last few decades NATO has reneged on their promise not to expand their influence eastward toward Russia. ..Just like the NY Times failed to inform people back in 2003 that Saddam really didn't have WMD, today they are misleading people about Putin and Russia. Except the possible outcome is far worse: nuclear annihilation of the human species. ..The West's goal was to take all of Ukraine and bring it under the control of the bankrupt IMF, ECB and other European banking institutions, and also take Crimea, and cut Russia off from the Black Sea, thereby continuing its plan to encircle Russia with so called defense missiles. The West and its media has been throwing a temper tantrum ever since it didn't get its way with Crimea which it really wanted. The ultimate goal is for regime change in Russia, then China, and Iran, not because of their lack of freedoms, but because their banking system and economies aren't hopelessly bankrupt, or bogged down by a black hole of derivatives gambling debt. This editorial should be renamed President Obama and Wall Streets Dangerous Moves.","It's NO SURPRISE that there's an assassination attempt on Putin, he's anti-Wall Street and City of London and against their destructive speculative casino of derivatives and other complex financial garbage!..The City of London along with Wall Street's global financial casino is HOPELESSLY bankrupt and CAN'T be saved!  The Euro is in the middle of collapse. Meanwhile the countries of Asia such as Russia and China are doing much better economically and are involved in big development projects such as space, science and infrastructure, stuff that America during the Presidencies of F.D.R. and J.F.K. used to do! ..The global bankers don't like this and want to see Putin dead and a puppet of their bankrupt financial system put into power in Russia. They would love to force regime change in Russia by giving Putin the Gaddafi treatment.","Illegal annexation of Crimea?  How about the illegal coup supported by the U.S. State Department's 5 Billion towards regime change in Ukraine to get a government friendly to the U.S., the European Union and it's too big to fail and jail hopelessly bankrupt mega banks? Under the Yanukovych government that was democratically elected by a majority of Ukrainians, the Russians offered a far better economic deal under the Customs Union.  ..Because Putin and Russia won't obey and submit to the IMF, the ECB, and the Federal Reserve policy of fascist austerity and high unemploymentunderemployment, and because they're actually investing in the future via a real space program, advanced infrastructure, water and power projects, etc. the Western controlled too big to fail and jail corporations that control Europe and the U.S. are demonizing Putin's Russia, along with other countries that are investing in its people such as China and India too.","Russia's invasion of Crimea? What about the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 all based on the lies that Saddam was behind 911 and he possessed weapons of mass destruction? ..Even Obama's own CIA director, John Brennan admitted that Russia is allowed up to 25,000 troops in Crimea under the 1997 treaty with Ukraine, and is thus acting within its treaty obligations  as President Putin has insisted. There was never a Russian invasion of Ukraine. ..Today the Wall Street run U.S. media is lying and spreading propaganda to get another unnecessary war going, but this time against a nuclear armed Russia. What is causing this insane drive to war against Russia? Well, the western oligarchs' financial system is bankrupt, thanks to trillions in speculation in exotic toxic financial instruments such as derivatives. The big banks and their puppet politicians have been imposing fascist austerity programs on the people of Europe and increasingly in the U.S. in a futile attempt to try to pay down an illegitimate gambling debt that can never be paid off. Of course it's not working, so they hope to demonize Putin and Russia, force regime change, put a regime that's friendly to the West, so they can loot the country, then do the same against China. They want to loot both countries to prop up their bankrupt financial system.","This editorial is nuts. ..It just demonizes Putin and whips up the American population into supporting confrontation with a nuclear armed country such as Russia. Nothing productive will come out of more sanctions, it will just escalate the situation, possibly leading to thermonuclear World War III. The editorial board doesn't tell people that the U.S. State Department spent 5 Billion towards Ukraine which led to the ouster of the democratically elected Yanukovych government and replacement with an illegal pro-EU austerity government which has neo-Nazi fascists in top positions in the new illegitimate government. ..The driving force behind confrontation with not only Russia but also China and India is the reality that the Trans-Atlantic financial system is hopelessly bankrupt and so the western financial oligarchs (Wall StreetCity of London) hope to loot productive countries such as Russia and so on to prop up their casino of a financial system. ..What's happening in Ukraine is not some local phenomenon but is part of a much larger geopolitical chess power game being played between the western too big to fail and jail mega banks and the Eurasian countries.","The sanctions must also hit the oligarchs whose media outlets parrot the regime lines, and target Mr. Putins entire war cabinet: the TV spin doctors, compliant Duma members and apparatchiks of Mr. Putins United Russia Party...What about the West's oligarchs?

This is the same type of government and media that lied and told everyone that Saddam had WMD which never existed, but the lie was so big that everyone at the time believed it. ..The EU and increasingly the U.S. is far from a paradise and is in fact hopelessly bankrupt thanks to trillions and trillions of gambling and speculation. There's a massive derivatives bubble that's about to pop and trigger a much worse economic collapse compared to the financial crisis in 2008.  ..The hopelessly bankrupt Trans-Atlantic casino of a financial system aka free market run by the big criminal banks is the driving force behind the drive against Russia, China, India and Iran.

HealedByGod,,,,"Putin came to the UN, on US soil,  and blatantly dismissed Obama as a non factor on the world  stage. And it is clear that Putin holds Obama in total contempt..He saw Obama thump his chest and say he could bomb Syria without Congressional approval and draw his infamous red line in the sand which he later tried to say it was the world's red line..He saw Obama ignore intelligence briefings on ISIS and then fail to develop a strategy to destroy them. Obama's  denigrate and destroy resulted in 70 of fighters having come back without dropping their pay load. There is no substance..He saw Obama go into Libya and when done leave it in state of anarchy..He saw him refuse to give Ukraine lethal aid to fight the rebels...Putin knows that Obama is a novice on the world front who thinks his charisma and charm will carry him through. Obama has to choose to ignore the taunts.  Before his first official visit to China they openly mocked Obama in the press. It was unprecedented. Putin has continually mocked Obama and in doing so has under mind his stature in the region. ..While it's a cliche' I believe it's true. Our enemies don't fear us and our allies don't respect us. Obama has taken the only super power in the country to a country that doesn't want to offend, doesn't want to take the lead, who can't formulate a coherent policy...Putin will back up what he says. Obama needs his teleprompter to tell him what to do. What a stark contrast in principle and approach.  And whose in control?","Mr Friedman.   Correct me if I am wrong but if Obamas sanctions against Putin and Russia were having the desired effect would Putin be using his rebels to begin again their expansionist attacks into Ukraine?  I wouldn't think so.  It is clear to me that something additional has to be done. Obama does not want to get involved I believe because he fears a direct conflict with Russia and he knows that Putin does not fear him or what he could potentially do..But Obamas action to me show a very clear and very obvious pattern..1) Despite enormous evidence to support it Obama did nothing about the torture, rape and murder of Coptic Christians. Their churches are destroyed yet Obama is silent..2) Obama had been receiving intelligence briefings for over a year on ISIS and despite overwhelming evidence he did not develop a contingency plan at all. And even when they took control of Fallujah and Ramadi early last year Obama called them a JV team. And even now his 5-6 air strikes a day are having little to no effect..Putin knows full well that NATO will do nothing since Ukraine is not in the alliance and therefore gives them the out they need to avoid conflict. For once in his presidency Obama needs to grow a pair and face Putin head on.  He should commit to providing whatever military and logistical help that is needed.  We are the only ones capable of blunting this but if Obama follows past practice he will make endless speeches and make idle threats and do what he always does  Nothing","This may not be realistic given the fact I don't know their holdings and where they are located but in looking at the number of Russian billionaires on Forbes list I was stunned at the number.

Putting sanctions on government officials is one thing, but why not hit them where it hurts? I can't believe that they don't have billions invested outside of the country but only with Putin's consent..Putin's rapid annexation, and this may be a really poor anology, but it reminds me of Germany's blitzkreig  in WWII and how they struck quickly and had no regard for the sovereign borders and the rights of it's citizen's...Whether or not the US was involved in their politics to me is a moot point. For how many years did the Soviets hand pick the leaders of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic,et. Were these leaders elected by a fair election process?. I don't care if we were involved. If anyone believes that either side does not engage in this type of action is naive'  and in no way justifies the people who were killed in Ukraine..Putin in emotionally dead, vicious thug with a short man's complex. All the staged shirtless pictures with his non existant pecs to me are to create a man's man image to overcome the fact he's a very short man.","A correction. When I said freeze all assets  I believe I said to freeze all assets in their country.  Anyone reading that would jump on that and I admit I made a mistake. What I meant to say is to ascertain all the holdings of their fat cat billionaires in the EU and the United States. Russia's economy in no way compares to the EU's and especially the US and that' not exactly a revelation. I believe for these people to have holdings outside of Russia it was only with Putin's consent. I also believe that if they do that Putin get's a large percentage that he set's for them to have the right to operate in markets outside of Russia. And I also wonder how many shell companies that do business with the sole purpose of funneling money to Putin since new innovation outside of military weapons is non existent..Am I completely wrong? Maybe and if I am, please tell me how without a character assassination. But Putin's economic machine cannot survive on the monies generated within it's borders. And if that is the case and the EU and the US can, I hate to say this,  but impose sanctions which shortly would result reverting back to a the shortages, and long lines that existed every day. Hardline Russians I believe see Putin as this almost mythical figure who is fixing a grave injustice and restoring Crimea to Russia. I can be a history revisionist too and completely ignore the facts. But Putin is his own PR guy so who would be foolish enough to challenge the accuracy of his facts?",Putin was livid that Gorbachev gave up the territories taken after the end of the Cold War and has repeatedly stated his goal to restore Russia to it's prior status. That's exactly what he is doiby..When Obama whiffed on bombing Syria even after getting getting evidence about the use of chemical weapons on it's people it created a void that Russia has filled..I also think about Obama's refusing to accept Congress' offer to fund the Free Syeian Army and to arm the Ukrainian Army with lethal weapons ..I keep going back to the reset button and his reneging on a deal Bush made and Obama said he would honor about placing a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic ..In every direct conflict with Russia Obama has failed to show up as listed above.  Just this week 2 Russsian intelligence ship were spotted off the east coast.They have flown in U.S. air space as well as Sweden and subs were in the English Channel. They do this because they know Obama will not do anything.  His failure to show strength and determination has only allowed Putin to continuing conquest of prior Unabated,"I am fascinated by those who absolve Russia in this civil war.  Apparently they forget forget Putin's condemnation of Gorbachev's relinquishing control and power over Soviet satellites and his stated goal to restore Russia to it's post WWII dominance. ..Whether the Ukranian president is a Russian proxy to me is irrelevant. Putin's naked aggression should be the concern given Russia's overrunning of Georgia in 2008. Let's  not forget that Putin threatened Ukraine with the loss of oil, something Ukraine is heavily dependent on..Ukraine does not have endless supply of war materials and given Germany's and France's refusal to arm the Ukranians the only chance at survival is if Obama get's a spine quit acting so passive. Putin knows Obama is more concerned with giving speeches and burnishing his legacy than making a critical decision to blunt Putin","Putin has manipulated this conflict masterfully, and he will continue to do so.  He knows that he is dealing from a position of strength and that will not change.  Ukraine not being a part of NATO limits the West somewhat as far as what they can do.  And Putin knows full well that a military solution is something the West, especially Obama will accept...Obama thinks that he can negotiate any situation and that a military option belies his liberal, left wing ideology. He made idle threats about bombing Syria and that did not go unnoticed. Couple that with his insistence about pulling out of Afghanistan and Iraq and Putin knew that Obama would not directly intervene in the civil war and he has not. He is not even arming the Ukrainians. Ukraine is there for Putin to take and Obama will stand behind his  lecturn making another of his endless speeches before he heads to the golf course to see if he can break par. After all, that is more important.  Putin knows exactly what he is doing.  Obama is still trying to fit a square peg, his foreign policy, instead a round hole, crisis after crisis in the world.","Putin is a contradiction in terms. He now wants a cease fire but to me for obvious reasons. First, he's achieved the strategic objectives. He took control of the strategically important ports in Crimea; he concocted this ridiculous narrative that they went into Ukraine to protect ethnic Russians thereby gaining the foothold he wanted..What I would like to know is are there any independent sources that Putin doesn't control who can verify that this abuse of the Russians took place?.Any cease fire will be on Putin's terms. He will dictate what will be done. Mr Poroshenko? His name will appear on the document but that's as far as his influence goes. He is merely a pawn in a much bigger game..Putin, as everyone knows, is a bitter former KGB colonel.  And he has been very vocal of his criticism of Gorbachev for giving back the store. And I believe that Putin is acting in a very measured manner and will come up with another crisis of a former satellite for which he is the only one capable who can handle it. He is a calculating, methodical, sadistic, lying manipulative worthless pile of DNA..This cease fire will not last as Putin will find another reason to once again assert himself into the country. Putin only knows expansion; contraction is a word not in his vocabulary.","I have to disagree  with the board. They annexed Georgia and they remain firmly in control and that will not change...With Ukraine, he accessed Crimea and the strategically important ports.  It gives them their first warm water port and it also give's them a significant tatical advantage...I think the board is fooling themselves if they feel that after all the posturing and the ornate signing celebration celebrating the annexation of Crimea he will not back down. He has the total support of his people and has done a great PR job of portraying the Russian speaking people of these areas as being persecuted.  He totally controls the media so it's difficult to challenge the veracity of his claims...Putin as everyone knows is a former KGB colonel. Does anyone actually believe that he no longer embraces this brutal, sadistic mindet?..Russian rebels continue to take control of key government buildings in the east.  Does that sound like someone acting independently of Putin's iron fist?..Just one guy's opinion but as much as I support Bush he did nothing about Georgia and Putin sees it's more of the same with Obama. ..What's the solution?  I am not an expert but I don't think at this point the sanctions are having an impact and until Merkel stops placating Putin I don' t see what Obama can really do.  I think he needs to quit making endless speeches and do something in the shadows that truly cripples their economy.  Don't announce it.  Just do it.","I respectfully disagree with the board to a point.  Putin has been very vocal about his desire to restore the Russian empire's territorial dominance. He was very critical of Gorbachev and his role in the demise of the Soviet Union..I think Putin's aims are very clear. He invaded Georgia when Bush 43 was president.  He annexed Crimea so they would have their first warm water ports and allow them to have dominance in the Mediterranean.  Second,  his invasion of Ukraine was a very strategic move and one that he made because he knew Obama would do nothing. ..Putin has just announced that they will be stationing troops in Belarus.  He has stepped into the void that Obama created with his empty threat about bombing Syria and his repeated demands that Assad step down,  that he did nothing to facilitate...Russia has violated Swedish air space,  Great Britain  and routinely violates ours. They intentionally buzzed our planes on the 4th of jury.  They violated our territorial waters with their subs off the east coast..   They havehad 2 spy ships stationed in Cuba..Putin manipulated Obama into reneging on his promise to build a missile defense system in Poland the Czech Republic..I believe that Putin holds Obama in complete disdain. Putin is very calculating and knows exactly what he wants to do. Obama  went into Libya and the result? He put the Muslim Brotherhood and invited them to the White House? Obama's lead from behind manta has been a foreign policy disaster of  epic proportions"
Steve C.,,,,"All I have to say is that the comments from the anti Putin crowd are extremely rude and insulting towards those who have a different view. ..I think it is an indicator of the character of those who seem--no not seem--do want a war with Russia.  That is they want war as long as they don't have to fight it...The world does not need another cold or hot war with Russia, it just does not.  Russia in World War II, under Stalin's leadership, was the best ally the U. S. had.  That was when allies mattered.  We should take a moment to remember that.","What exactly is the U. S. interest in the Ukraine?  Honestly, I just do not see how the Ukraine could effect United States security so much as to cause all this aggravation.   What is the point of the name calling and taunting of Putin and the Russians?  It's unseemly and childish.  Didn't we get enough of that in the 40 plus years of the Cold War?..It just seems to me that with the world teetering on the edge of who knows what kind of major crises, there would be more stability and predictablity if the the U. S. and Russia cooperated with each other for the good of all...It isn't impossible.  Russia and, yes, Stalin were the best ally the U. S. had in World War II.  At least we should honor that fact, shouldn't we?",,,,,,,,
Timbob,,,,"Earth to Bill M: Obama and NATO are trying to start World War III? How, exactly? By tricking peace-loving Putin into invading and annexing Crimea?","Your analogy NATO is to Russia what the Warsaw Pact was to the US. Is doubly faulty. First, all Ukraine sought was closer ties to the European Union, not alliance with NATO. Second, and more important, NATO is not hostile to Russia as the Warsaw Pact was to America. For many years after the collapse of the USSR, NATO tried in many ways to establish a cooperative relationship with Russia. NATO's member states are far more independent of the US than the Warsaw Pact countries ever were of the Soviet Union, and there's not one of these countries that has ever shown the slightest inclination to attack Russia, a nuclear weapons power with by far the largest land army in Europe. That Putin thinks EU equals NATO equals possible attack on Russia may be so--after all, he was an officer in the old Soviet KGB. But it's conceding far too much to grant this paranoid thinking any validity when we ourselves try to evaluate the situation.","This is disinformation worthy of the old Soviet KGB, whose loyal servant Putin was for so many decades. Remember: he called the collapse of the USSR and its system of satellites (installed by force after WW 2) the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century. Is it so hard to grasp that he wants it back, and will take as much of it back as he thinks he can safely get away with?",,,,,,,
JB,,,,"Sanctions are not working.  They did not stop Putin from invading Ukraine. Sanctions will become moot once Ukraine is conquered and Putin installs a new government in Kiev.  The threat of sanctions will not contain Putin's obvious military ambitions against his neighbors. Sadly, Europe is unable, or unwilling, to stop Ukraine from becoming what Czechoslovakia became so many decades ago: the first.",The 1980's called to remind us that the Russians have a history of aggression and can't be trusted. Also that Vladimir Putin served 16 years during the 1980's in the KGB (one of the most ruthless secret police agencies that has ever existed) and retired from the KGB as a Lieutenant Colonel. Is there any reason to think he has changed?,"This has happened before and will happen again.  The Permanent Court of International Justice -- in the Eastern Carelia case -- made it clear that Russia could not be prevented from abusing minorities under international law.  Now we are asking Russia to behave in a manner contrary to its national interests in the name of some Democrat lawmakers view of international law.  The Russians are offended by our State Department's lack of understanding of the situation.  Shame on us for tolerating a State Department where the Secretary of State makes statements like It's not personal, as if to say, We have no control over what we are doing, but please don't stop liking us because it is so important that you like us.  Putin is an evil man, but even evil men can laugh at fools.",,,,,,,
JC,,,,"If it weren't for the EU's incursions none of this would have happened. They pushed too hard, went behind Russia's back and tried to be cute with a take it or leave it offer and it backfired terribly. It's mind boggling that this is being spun as a pure act of aggression on the part of Russia when the EU had made extremely aggressive diplomatic moves in the first place. Putin's tactics are more heavy handed and unacceptable, but the West tried to take Ukraine in the first place, he's simply saying I can play this game too.","Military aid to the Ukranian government will only increase the odds of a Putin invasion in the border countries ringing Russia.  And Putin is more like Stalin than Hitler--paranoid about being hemmed in by the West, seeing Russia under seige, and terrified of losing his personal dictatorship.  Putin is the direct descendant of the old Bolshevik mentality (his grandfather was one of Lenins kitchen staff) .  And the desire to control the Ukraine, Lithuiania, Belarus, Georgia , and territorial disputes over  Polish land, date back to Tsarist times...The Cheka, OGPU, and KGB always behaved as a government within a government , funding themselves through theft, expropriation, and self-dealing..Putin and his coterie of ex-KGBers controlled immense wealth stashed away in off-shore accounts, biding their time until they got themselves elected.  And then they proceeded to consolidate and extend their wealth and power. ..Our strategy should be to keep the price of oil dropping and to use sanctions to weaken Putin--not to strengthen him with military provocations.  Ramp up world oil production, and tax gasoline to fund alternative energy, and get Europe and the Baltic states , Poland and Ukraine off dependency on Russian gas.","If Putin's actions took anyone, let alone the US government, by surprise, then we are hopeless.  Of course this was what he was going to do..He has called Obama's bluff every single time.  Obama preaches compromise-- when did that become a cardinal virtue?  How can you ask for compromise if there is no compelling reason, nor any means of enforcement?.Try connecting the dots and the next moves are also utterly predictable.  More of the same from Putin, who will take advantage of every allowance given to him, feining cooperation only when necessary..Lack of decisive action and resolve has given Putin the power that now has influence in the middle East, Europe, the UN..Is it too much to ask for a bit of courageous leadership, to stand on principle for the sake of those who can't defend themselves?   Compromise has brought us to where we are today.  Remember the red line?","If Putin's actions took anyone, let alone the US government, by surprise, then we are hopeless.

They are dedicated to misinformation and mischief-making, and exerting influence in advancing Putin's agenda. Russia donates money to European Right Wing political parties in order to hamper functioning democracies everywhere.  Russia employs high profile ex-leaders like Gerhardt Schroeder, Silvio Berlesconi , ex CEO's and others to lobby for them. ..We did not drive Russia to the right with NATO  expansion. Putin and a cabal of KGB personnel began transferring enormous sums of Communist Party cash to private accounts overseas when they saw the handwriting on the wall under Gorbachev. They later used the cash to bribe, buy and intimidate their way into power. ..We are much safer with a weakened and humbled Putin. And we can only hope that the Russian people grow weary with this liar, their and bully.","The unfortunate reality is that we live in an age of political and geographical power moves that are tethered to realities that exist in the fantasy realms of conspiracy theory, outright superstition, denial of historical facts and newly fabricated ones.  And no one, not Germans, Russians nor Americans is immune to this disease...Modern media, the Internet, and a new strain of politicians willing to say anything that pops into their head in order to achieve a response is in a feedback loop fueled by the resentment and fear of uneducated populations. ..Unchecked oligarchs like Murdoch and Putin and even fairly benign ones like Bloomberg have far too much influence in their ability to shape what passes for popular sentiment.  And there is a cottage industry of lesser fringe figures with their own boutique ideologies that bottom feed on the rest of their national polities and are able to gain credibility in parliamentary systems.","I still don't understand how the EU isn't getting a lot of the blame here. They went around Putin's back to set up a trade framework while offering zero assurances to the Russia throughout the process, and only inflamed things by making it a take-it-or-leave-it proposal.  Whether that was their goal or not is irrelevant at this point, it's blown up in their faces. I'm in agreement with TrueNorth. Freedom and Democracy meant little to the average Russian when their gas prices went through the roof and they no longer had a place to work. There's a reason Putin has so much support from the older generation and the rural population. By no means is he in the right, but it would behoove many to understand the situation, rather than paint in self-rightous broad strokes.","While everyone seems to scoff at Putin's claims (some of which is justified) can he really be blamed? The E.U. takes full responsibility in this. If they hadn't pussy-footed around with their trade deal and made ulimatums the backlash in the Ukraine wouldn't be as great. And what about reassurances to Russia? No effort made there to show that their alignment would not ruin the trade arrangements Russia enjoys with one of its best partners. Either the EU intentionally stirred the pot and got exactly what they wanted, or they miscalculated the situation horribly. Regardless they were the aggressors in this from a policy standpoint. Though Russian's reaction may be heavy handed, they certainly were given every avenue and excuse to do so. The State Department's statementsis false. There's no wrong side of history at play here, just an unnecessary mess.","You fail to mention, David, that Putin's governance is rampant with purposeful homophobia and anti-Semitism..While denouncing the Ukraine reform elements uniformly as Nazis and Fascists,  the state media apparatus pounds viewers all day long (think of Fox News) with anti-gay and anti-Semitic propaganda. It's owner was head of a party that proposed banning all Jewish organizations in Russia...Putin has combined the traditional Stalinist conspiratorial view of Jews and the decadent West (read Europe) with a National Socialist alliance of oligarchs and state-owned industry to  weild autocratic power.  ..The revolt against Yanukovich (a mini-me Putin and pliable junior partner, equally repressive and anti-democratic) is a real threat to Putin's dangerous (more to its own people than anyone) Eurasian Union.","You fail to mention, David, that Putin's governance is rampant with purposeful homophobia and anti-Semitism..While denouncing the Ukraine reform elements uniformly as Nazis and Fascists,  the state media apparatus pounds viewers all day long (think of Fox News) with anti-gay and anti-Semitic propaganda.

Kathy,,,,"I visited Crimea in 2006. My first night, in a small hotel in Balaklava, I couldn't figure out why I couldn't communicate with the owner. I was using the Ukrainian language vocabulary from my guidebook. Next morning, she got through to me that here we say spasiba. After I found some Russian language help in a different guidebook we got on much better. Nowhere in Crimea did I encounter any Ukrainian. Then I discovered that Crimea was only added to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954. I also spent some time at the Black Sea Fleet Museum in Sevastopol, feeling like I was acutally in Russia. I am not at all surprised by the result of the referendum, and would expect the result to be the same if it were held under better conditions...Obviously, Putin's actions are despicable, but I see no point in trying to reverse them. What is needed is a better plan for protecting the integrity of the rest of Ukraine. And measures to reassure the Baltic states, who must be feeling distinctly nervous.","Putin needs enemies, conflict, fear, paranoia, agents of foreign governments who must be rooted out...

And by all means let's allow them to take their gear, humvees and heavy equipment with them to the beaches of eastern Ukraine...Ludicrous! Putin appears to be successful in insulting our intelligence.",Russia is a Communist country.  Economic sanctions are useless against a centralized communist political system.   What are the US and it's Allies going to do if Russia proceeds?  NOT buy their oil?   Point out the outcome for Russia throughout history when Russia went to war in Russian geography and lost?  Tell our citizens and Europe  how bad Putin is for Russia?   Or talk about Putin's lack respectability among ourselves?    I believe this is not about how much the world respects Putin.  It is about how much Putin respects Obama.,,,,,,
Vlad,,,,As long as we're on the topic of Putin and oil don't forget that the country that controls Crimea gets rights to a huge chunk of the Black Sea floor which has recently shown a lot of potential for oil drilling. ..I'll let you decide how much of a coincidence this is...,Now the question is in which regions people of Ukraine people will decide to become part of Russia. Putin does not force anybody in Ukraine to become part of Russia.,&gt;  The Geneva Convention prohibits posting soldiers without their national military identification. Putin violated both of these international conventions. ..Do you have a proof that troops were Putin's? May be those trups were Crimea's citizens?,&gt; Putin lost the day he sent special forces in Crimea with masks on their faces ...Do you have a proof that it was Putin who sent them?..&gt; The Ruble has lost 10 percents already and it is a question of time before the real economy suffers from it ..That's because western funds are selling russian stocks being afraid that war will begin.

US wants to be empire of the world. What's wrong with Russia  willing to be in center of pro-russian empire?..&gt; when Russia badly needs engagement with the West to advance its outdated economy. ..The economy of Russia grows. The economy of Europe and US shrinks. Who's economy is outdated?","&gt; American officials said the plane was hit by a Russian-made missile..Yes, Ukraine army is equipped with Russian-made missles. Is this the problem that it's made in Russia?..&gt;  Mr. Putin and those who support him seem incapable of accepting that their model of government, with all its cronyism, corruption and bullying, is not the one many former Soviet subjects want...Hey, 80 of russian population supports Putin (while only 35 of US population supporting Obama). ..&gt; And if that fails, how can the innocent victims in the Malaysian jetliner not impress on him that this useless contest must be ended now?..Why innocent victims not impress Obama that US should stop dictating Ukraine and Europe what to do?",Nothing is Black and White these days.. Even though getting Europe more involved does make sense in getting Putin to do the right thing... the bad news is Europe will the start to turn to the US for more of it's energy needs... That means more drilling and fracking on US territory... and under our current REGULATIONS.. that will be very self-destructive.,"Even though I would love to see the Ukrainian government properly equipped to fight this menace... the fact that Obama has shown restraint (as opposed to the McCain constant drum beating) by not sending military supplies to the Ukrainian government and letting them handle the affair on their own, will ultimately prove to be a winning strategy as long as we (with the help from our allies), compel Putin to cease and desist his criminal activities.","I have to disagree strongly with Brooks' assertion that this isn't a normal regime. It echoes a similar and mistaken stance taken by Kennan in his Long Telegram. Putin, even more than his Soviet predecessors, is driven by greed and a petty lust for power. He can be reasoned with and he can be coerced. One must simply find the right pressure points and levers. Pressuring the Russian economy and capital markets is futile -- Putin does not bow to business or any lobbies. The more effective approach would be to target his political elite, and their vast foreign assets specifically. Most of these people have significant capital abroad, as well as family members. Deny them their stolen wealth, restrict their travel to the West, and deport their families.","I have to disagree strongly with Brooks' assertion that this isn't a normal regime.

There is no East-West power struggle going on in Ukraine other than the one being waged by Ukraine's own people fed up with living in a corrupt mini-me version of Putin's Russia. The attempt to dress this up as a NATO or EU strategy obscures (and deliberately so) the fact that this is what most of Ukraine clearly wants, which Putin cannot stand.","No doubt lies and face-saving on both sides, just as there can be little doubt that this is exactly what Putin intended - a destabilized, demoralized Ukraine where he can call the shots anytime he likes in any way he pleases. A normal world and a normal peace, internationally agreed-upon borders, free trade, good neighbors and open societies have no attraction precisely because they're legal, above-board and honest. Putin needs the corrupt, the easily blackmailed the criminal and the thuggish. They're his only friends, the ones who stand to gain from his support...When will Europe stop wishing away this malevolent cancer on its eastern doorstep?","Determining what the government of Ukraine should look like is not a privilege for the Russian president to determine. For a generation, a Ukrainian unitary state didn't cause Russia to bat an eyelash. Now, Putin's propaganda machine is in full works, churning out lies and nonsense as fast as it can...Whatever Putin wants, everybody elsse loses. The most stunning upset would be for Ukraine to withraw from the east, force the thugs to secede whether they like it or not, then work to create a NATO 'Partnership for Peace' plan that would lead to full membership. Putin's cruelty and stupidity would come home full force. Nobody else is responsible for this but him anyway.","Putin wades in where angels (and some devils) fear to tread.

The connections with PayPal, Visa and others have to be rooted out and severed completely, otherwise western sanctions remain a pleasant fiction, nothing more.","Putin was the only one smiling at Minsk probably because he knew (and planned all along) for this to happen, while Poroshenko - swallowing all pride - could scarcely hide his legitimate contempt...It might well be politically suicidal, but Kyiv's long-term strategy should focus on withdrawal of its forces and not just leaving, but expelling Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts from Ukraine. Let Zakharchenko's and the thugs preening around the east join Russia, Mauritania, Mars, whatever. Then get busy saving and governing a slightly smaller Ukraine...Of course Putin does not want this. He wants Ukraine in a state of permanent chaos, fueled by separatist fires he can pour gasoline on at a moment's notice. Precisely for this reason if no other, Ukraine and the West must deny him this bit of cruelty. I hope the leadership of both NATO and the EU recognize this as well.","Putin wades in where angels (and some devils) fear to tread.

Like a fanged rabbit yanked out of a dusty hat most people had forgotten even existed, Putin made something appear that had no place in the region. Russia spun a new fairy tale about Crimea starkly reminiscent of the staged Gleiwicz attack on Germany by Poles, who were simply SS officers dressed as civilians broadcasting radio messages in Polish to give a bizarre, totally phony pretext to war...Why Putin thinks he can turn the clock back to some phony 'Great Russia' time is the real mystery. Eventually, these parts of Ukraine will be expelled by Kyiv. A stronger, more governable Ukraine will emerge and Putin will have succeeded only in turning an entire neighboring country firmly against him. Like most aggressors - he will ultimately have defeated only himself.","Putin has been utterly consistent for 20 years in his lack of understanding for the collapse of the Soviet Union, mis-diagnosing the collapse of the moral underpinnings of communism through a purely Machiavellian paralysis of power perspective. For him, all issues are redactive, everything bound up in the Leninist concept of the 'correlation of forces.' He sees America as weak - he makes a move to challenge. There is nothing particularly profound, strategic or wise in his behavior...Things will not go well for Putin, Putinism or his framework for looking at the world. Russia is in store for yet a second wake-up call in a generation, but this one looks far nastier than the previous one of simple disengagement."

Yes, the manner in which it occurred stinks to high heaven, but it is now over, and Russia can rest knowing that it's naval port is forever secure and protected.  ..The question now is will Putin continue in his efforts to destabilize Ukraine, particularly eastern Ukraine, or will he leave it alone.

When Russia intervened in August Poroshenko wisely realized the futility of continuing the war, and Ukraine agreed to grant autonomy to the rebel held areas.

And that is what led us to the present negotiation. ..I think the wiser deal would have been for Ukraine to accept the rebels demand for complete separation and then just wall them off and cut ties completely, and continue to build up military forces to prevent any further land losses.

bobaceti,,,,Pro-Russian commentators in the west seem to have fallen for the creative narrative orchestrated by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Minsk accord in September last year was effectively a tactical delay by pro-Russian rebels and troops in east Ukraine. The humanitarian mission by Russian truck convoys hid arms and munitions in vehicles and rolled into Ukraine  past borders under rebel control. News media personnel from the west were faked-out by empty or near-empty truck trailers. The Putin government is following the pattern of Hitler's Big Lie: ..1) Russians are not involved in Ukraine civil unrest other than humanitarian aid;.2) Rebel forces heavy armaments tanks and missiles were not supplied by Russia;.3) The Ukrainians shot-down and killed 298 air passengers of MH17 - just look at the photo-shopped evidence;.4) Russian soldiers in Ukraine do not exist - it is a NATOKiev propaganda campaign.5) Kiev's military forces and the illegal government are neo-Nazi nationalists Bandera followers.6) The Crimea belonged to Russia all along - no annexation was necessary.7) The Americans instigated the Ukrainian civil war for their own interests to place missiles in east Ukraine to point them at Russia; and to profit from the resources of the Ukraine;.8) Russia's only interest is to protect the Russian-speaking people in east Ukraine who asked for help and assistance to defend against the artillery shelling by fascist Ukrainian military and Right Sector forces.,"No one considers the aide for Russian troops? Putin's tactic may be a trap to entice the Ukrainians to make foolish demands on the aide convoy - as appears the case. The counter-tactic would be to permit the Russia aide to roll across the border to a designated location within Ukrainian control outside of Luhansk and Donetsk (Donbas). Once the cargo was inspected for contraband it would be distributed using the same trucks with pairs of Russian and Ukrainian aide workers - two per truck. Whether or not ICRC is involved is not relevant. Possession of the aide and distribution channel is more important.  If the Russians fail to distribute the aide for any reason the world's press would be able to document the events and the information would confirm Putin's lack of credibility. ..It may not be challenging for Russian troops to blitzkrieg into Donbas region. The aide may be a tactical supply as an army would need to be supplied with food to sustain an occupation until dedicated supply lines and basic supplies could be marshaled to support an occupation force of 10,000- 20,000 troops on foreign soil. ..The best approach is permit the Russians to continue to bring in the aide under watchful escort of Ukrainian troops observed by the world's global press. To react and delay shipment would be folly. Borders and flags mean nothing to those without food, water and basic shelter.","The election should be postponed now that the East has defacto succeeded. The bigger issue is the protection and possible resettlement of Ukrainian nationalists from the East to the western demarcation line near the Dnieper River basin. The undertaking would be massive but the cost would be less than considered if planned correctly and completed with new cities that bring the Ukraine into the 21st century while generating construction and development employment.  The west and Ukraine shouldn't be too concerned about the East as it may be the industrial heartland but it is also dependent upon Russia's economy.  Eventually, Russia will learn, as will the 2nd class Russians of East Ukraine, that it is unfortunate that they will get what they wished for. They simply traded Ukrainian corruption for Russian corruption and retreated from the European experience, expertise and western investment funding to drive the Ukraine's moribund economy toward higher productivity and incomes through foreign investment and economic development. The order of business in Kiev is to engage in discussions with the west to help finance the long-term development of an EU Ukraine comprised of western Ukrainians and resettled eastern Ukrainians who see the future within the EU and not as handmaidens of Mr. Putin's New Russia. A big job that will modernize and develop the New Ukraine.","One the conditions of the Minsk cease-fire clearly confirms the role of Russia:..'Ukrainian state to provide humanitarian aid; restore full economic links with DonetskLuhansk, including welfare payments and banking services; Ukrainian state to help develop DonetskLuhansk and regions' co-operation with Russia.'..Russian authorities insist they can't control what happens on the ground yet they are the main and only party representing the rebels in Minsk and a specified role is required by the Ukrainian state's efforts to help develop DonetskLuhansk in cooperation with Russia. ..The veil of fiction has dropped and the true protagonist has come forward to deal on behalf of the pro-Russian Rebels. The rebels are committed to a long war backed-up by Russian resources. The economic rehabilitation of Donbas in co-venture between Kiev and Putin's Kremlin is not likely to work.",If there was a Coup in Kiev there was a rebel take-down of Donbas backed by Russian resources and troops. The Kiev Coup was a home-brew and all the leadership now are Ukrainians. In Donbas the leaders are proxy Ukrainians: ethnic Russians born in Ukraine and Russian professional soldiers and commanders who act like Ukrainians. You and others have repeated the Kiev Coup story that originates from Mr. Putin and his cohorts. This is the same guy who repeatedly claimed there are no Russian soldiers or equipment provided to the Rebels. Putin is a master of the Big Lie in the Stalin tradition. His attitude is condescending and an insult to westerners and a direct assault on decency in foreign affairs and relations between states.,Lest we forget the 298 soles killed by RebelsRussians operating a Russian supplied ground-to-air BUK missile launcher. The Russians released a phony 'photo-shopped' picture showing a Ukrainian jet flying at a 45 degree angle from the distant MH17 aircraft. The faked photo was shrugged-off by western leaders as a stunt by Putin to convince locals (Russians) that the Ukrainians are evil and only Russia is interested in peace and human aid.  The story is old and tiresome and continues to fade to black as lies are piled onto more lies and denials about Russian troops on the ground in Donbas.,"I think a war of attrition is what the neocons believe is winnable.  You do recall that the Russians had a bit of hard time in Afghanistan and Georgia? Just because Ukraine is op, skip and jump doesn't make it that much easier to neutralize unless the Russians are willing to Nuke the place - which would be a last option.  I think with adequate supplies, training and financing of food and other essential supplies, Ukrainians will fight back harder than Afghanistan and Georgia. And the war of attrition circled by embargo will eventually lead to strange bedfellows - North Korea, China and Russia with a few Middle East tribes, the west has the resources to outlast the Russian-lead possible escalation of war against Ukraine.  There are 5 million people in Donbas and  40 million outside of this enclave that support the Kiev govt. I bet on the west and Kiev in the long-run. And I think the next Coup de tat will be at the Kremlin when the Oligarchs realize that Putin is very very bad for business.","Read Pritchard's comment above for clarity and circumstantial evidence. I didn't know that a civil war required probative evidence before a court before a news release can be issued. What would you say about Putin's evidence about the downing of MH17? Or, do you think 'photo-shop pictures are reliable evidence?","Say No to Austerity. IMF-EU-US followers of 'austerity economics' plan will drive Ukraine and Russia into deeper conflict.  EU is waiting for Ukraine default so that it doesn't bailout Russian debt while 'helping' Ukraine...Smart approach would be for EU-Ukraine government to agree to succession plan from Crimea and Eastern Ukraine as part of a deal that would see 'Russian Ukraine' acquire Russian debt and merge with Russia. ..EU-Ukraine would remain as separated state subject to IMF-EU economic stimulus. Cash is required to keep EU-Ukraine solvent. EU trade credits attached to audit-compliance conditions close the deal that would benefit EU economy as well...The biggest challenge is to negotiate the merger of Russian interests and their territories back to Russian control. It would put the Russian (Putin) state on notice of compromise. Ukrainian independence is being used by Putin as a rouse: take-away the issue and call Russia's bluff. ..Ukrainians who are aligned with Kiev in East Ukraine-Crimea will need assistance in relocating - if they wish - to EU-Ukraine (West).  ..The proposed plan is similar to the merger of East and West Germany. In this case, the Russian rhetorical anti-EU-Ukraine position would be check-mated with a compromise solution that favors both sides interests: securing Russian culture and territory in East Ukraine and Crimea as a province of Russia and diffusing the Ukrainian Crisis with a less onerous IMF lead financial plan and EU membership path.","It is more than likely that Putin will send in the troops to protect Russian interests in Crimea and East Ukraine. NATO should be involved in exercises while political channels between EU leadership and Putin and Obama and Putin are open to resolve the issues and form an agreement to avoid making matters worse. Eventually, Russia should be heard as its interests are legitimate.  The geopolitical location and cultural history of East Ukraine and Crimea are sufficient to cause Russia to become alarmed and it would be foolish to think a war of words would somehow end in good harmony...I think the EU and select G8 (x-EU) need to have a chin-wag with Putin to resolve the political-economic fallout in the Ukraine for all concerned. Ukraine has internal problems that can be resolved provided the people of Ukraine and external parties can agree on an even-handed solution best for each of the two major ethnic groups - Ukrainians and Russians living within the Crimea and East-Ukraine."

David V,,,,"Mr. Putin made it clear that Russias patience for post-Cold War accommodation, much diminished of late, had finally been exhausted..That is the most important point. Russia does not  accept 1991 formation of 15 independent states and will try to restore Soviet era empire..Many Russians living in these states will support Putin.  Economic situation in Russia is much better than in their counties, and Russians outside Russia do not want to assimilate and accept cultures of countries they live in. Old generation does not have democratic values and prefer to return to the life they had in USSR..I do not know how the West can deal with such situation.","That may be a new Putin plan:.Ukrainian government is too weak to crackdown separatists and they want to avoid bloodshed. The only force who can stabilize the situation in Eastern Ukraine is Putin and it looks like Russia will be a part of peace negotiations between US, EU and Ukraine. Separatists will stop their fight but only after Russia got what it wants regarding federalization of Ukraine. By doing that Putin will accomplish many goals:.1. He will act as a peacemaker in Ukraine conflict and that will help him to improve his image in the West that considers him an aggressor now..2. He will effectively block Ukraine from entering NATO and even EU and will help to keep Ukraine close to Russia..3. Many Ukrainians will be quite happy with Putin peacekeeping actions - stopping the war and economic collapse is more important than joining EU now..4. Inside Russia Putin will satisfy hard dye nationalists by giving them Crimea, at the same time he will please liberals for his peace actions in Ukraine, and oligarchs for not breaking economical ties with The West..5. The West will be quite happy too as they do not want the escalation in Ukraine and economic burden dealing with Ukraine economy alone (it is quite possible that Russia will restore previous natural gas prices and provide other economic assistance to Ukraine if Putin gets what he wants)..6. Russian will play a bigger role in the world as everybody will remember Crimea and what Russia can do if it wants.","I am afraid Putin won again. Crimea annexation is not a subject of US-Russia negotiation and is a done deal. Russia set conditions to the West as Ukrainian federation, ban for Ukraine to enter NATO, referendums in all regions, etc. In exchange it will agree to pull out its troops from the Ukrainian borders and allows international monitors in Ukraine. The future of Ukraine is doomed and its attempt to closer ties with the West will fail again..Russia position shows that it will never accept Ukraine as a sovereign state.","Finally a good and balanced analysis of the situation in Ukraine..Putin's goal is federalization of Ukraine, preventing it from joining EU and NATO, and stay under Russia influence..The current mess in Eastern Ukraine, partially orchestrated by Russia, should help him to accomplish that. To avoid civil war and economic collapse Ukraine and the West will have to agree with Putin conditions.",,,,,,
c harris,,,,The NYTs in their endless chutzpah have tried to sell the story that Putin is solely responsible for the situation in Ukraine.  They know that is completely wrong.  They continue to try float their fantasy that the west must confront Russia.  The US is pretty much driving Germany and France to distraction with their obsession for regime change in Russia.  This dangerous fantasy could spin out control and lead to a military confrontation between the US and Russia.,Sounds like a neo con convention.  Of course Obama should meet Putin.  The red herring of Putin's being the villain of the Ukraine mess and the constant haranguing of the NYT of Putin over this is tiresome.  In Syria the NYT now states that Putin is involved in some new gambit.  Of course it is way off base.  As is well known the Russia has been allies with Syria for years.  Negotiations between Obama and Putin are essential.,More Putin bashing and displacing the west's aggressive take all of Ukraine including Crimea agenda.  Some of what Cohen says is interesting but most of it is the tired rhetoric that Putin is starting another Cold War and threatening imminent attack on former Soviet Republics.   None of this makes any sense except that it fits into Cohen's efforts to throw every flimsy accusation he can think of at Putin.  Some might call it Yellow Journalism.  The EU accusation is particularly smelly since Putin offered the Ukrainians a better deal which the coup plotters were loathe to accept.  In the end this is an effort by the US to treat the Russians as a defeated nation after the collapse of the USSR.  Yeltsin didn't help the situation by acquiescing to NATOs reckless expansion into the east even after they promised that they would not.  Putin is in charge because of Yeltsin's weakness.,"This a true Alice in Wonderland article.  The Russians have been endlessly provoked in their own backyard by NATO.  The Ukraine gov't, after the 214 coup, makes noises as if they were going to turn Ukrainian Russians into second class citizens.  They expect to get sovereignty over the whole country. Now NATO is propositioning equipment in Estonia and preparing for a military deployment.  Dangerous is an understatement.   Unnecessary is certainly the case.  The endless efforts to demonize Putin and make him into a threat only bring some sort of confrontation close.",Yesterday the NYTs was absolutely right about the Senates dangerous stepping into the nuclear framework agreement the Obama Administration worked out with Iran.  Today their back to their Neo Con demonizing Putin trick.  NATOs advance into the Baltic States is inherently destabilizing.  But the NYTs states the Russians have no legitimate interests that the US is bound to respect.,Rather than Putin being increasingly ostracized the USs mindless intervention is coming to out right rejection by Germany and France.  This war was started in the west and had no chance of success.  Ukraine's increasing economic troubles has placed Porochenko in the obvious position of relenting.,An unconfirmed report that Putin and Russia planned to take Crimea because the Ukrainian situation was getting out control.  With foreign intrigue.  Crimea makes sense to be a place where the Russians would act preemptively.  It was a semi autonomous region that had a large Russian military presence there.  The Crimea is non controversial as far as I am concerned.  Certainly sending a drunken mob of poorly led solders to fight in SE Ukraine along Russia's border makes no sense.,President Poroshenko should withdraw Ukrainian forces from the contested zone.  The country should be divided up.  The former Soviet Republic was given to a former Soviet big wig(Leonid Kravchuk) after the USSRs break up.  As the NYTs has shown the map has been rewritten three times since WWI.  Most of what is western Ukraine was in Poland.  Many of the Ukrainians came from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Stalin moved the borders 300 miles west after WW2.  Crimea was never part of Ukraine until Khrushchev on his own moved Crimea from Russia to Ukraine.  Crimea was basically an autonomous region with a large Russian military presence until Putin annexed it to Russia.  This war has come from the west.,Talk about living in an alternate universe.  Your understanding of post WW2 history is poor.  Your understanding of the coup in Ukraine in Feb. 2014 is woefully off the mark.  This conflict in eastern Ukraine is coming from the west.  Crimea has  a complicated history since the Ottoman empire but one thing is wasn't was part of  is Ukraine.  This is another in a long of efforts by pundits to make Putin responsible for all the problems in Ukraine.  That he is bent on aggression and the like.  What we have a wild overreach by NATO to expand.,"The way that Ukraine crumbled with Yanukovych being chased out of Kiev unsettled Putin and his crony capitalist buddies in Russia.  Yanukovych was setting up his family with riches while Ukraine strained economically.  The problem arises when the Ukrainians rejected Russian aide for hoped for western aid, perhaps being accepted in the European Union and NATO.   Now Ukraine is in a terrible plight because the West is locked in stupid austerity and the Russians unalterably nationalistic, for domestic reasons as well as for strategic ones."
H. almost sapiens,,,,If Mr. Putin occupies the moral high ground in this situation then indeed the world is flat.,"There are at least three problems with just moving on, Walter...1. There is a substantial minority (maybe as much as 40 of the population) of Crimeans who may not want to be part of Russia.  Who knows.  What happens to them?  Ethnic cleansing?  Armed resistance?..2.  There is the Russophonephile population of eastern Ukraine that's already riled up and, despite Mr. Putin's intentions there, may continue stirring the pot to provoke reaction by the government in Kiev, or by Russia, or both.  Will this be (largely?) peaceful or get uglier and uglier?..3.  There is the government in Kiev that still has to adjustreact to the new normal -- what will it do?   And what will the Ukrainian rightnationalists do either as part of the government or outside of it?..This is not a two-player chess game between the West and Russia; there are many other actors involved, some quite unsavory.  We can hope, but it is hard to see how this ends well.","Perhaps Mr. Putin had a plan, despite the analyses and opinions reported here.  But if so, doesn't he have to be very concerned about how this plays out; about how much instability he wants to deal with on his southwestern border for (perhaps) years to come?  Irrespective of the outcome in Crimea (What if a Crimean plebiscite actually resulted in a preference for Ukraine -- an outcome the Russians could never allow?), the pots of Russian- and Ukrainian-nationalism have been deeply stirred.  Will the Tatar minority in Crimea take a change of status quietly?  Will Russophiles in eastsouthern Ukraine not be emboldened to continued agitation and eventually provocations of or by Kiev inviting further Russian intervention?  Will Ukrainian nationalists (especially the proto-fascist elements) abide the annexation of Crimea and not see the serious threat to the country's territorial integrity from continued Russian adventurism in the eastsouth?..I hope to be wrong, but I don't see any good outcome -- unless this gets deescalated and resolved very quickly, with Ukraine intact.  Perhaps some long-tern agreements between Russia and Ukraine dealing with gas supplies and the Black Sea Fleet port, maybe some measure of greater autonomy for Crimea?..It seems pretty clear that Russian agents (aka tourists) are and have been doing a lot of the pot stirring, but there also seems to be a receptive audience.","So who are the fascists in this drama?  I subscribe to the definition of fascism put forth by Hannah Arendt and Barrington Moore.  One of the important, defining elements of which is strident nationalism uniting specific social sectors (pay attention Republicans)...If those definitions are useful, there are certainly fascist elements among the Ukrainian nationalists (though apparently a fairly small, if disciplined, minority) as well as among the pro-Russian agitators (who seem to be pretty consistently the aggressors in attackingbeating peaceful protesters on the other side -- fascist in behavior if not politics)...So perhaps what we are seeing in Crimea (and other parts of easternsouthern Ukraine) are fascist elements among the Russophiles -- egged on by all those recent Russian tourists -- basing their oppositionattacks on the specter of fascist elements among the Ukrainian nationalists -- fascists of one stripe (supported by Russia) against fascists elements of another.  (Just like in Syria?  With Russia playing deeply in both.)..Isn't it extremely troubling that Russia's actions may serve to strengthen the powerappeal of the fascist elements on both sides?  Is that what Mr. Putin wants, or is merely willing to ruthlessly exploit?  And what are the longer term consequences of that development in terms of regional stability irrespective of the outcome in Crimea?","Yes ... and while this may be an roughly accurate assessment of Mr. Putin's worldview, you know that Mr. McCain is, in fact, projecting his own...Several years ago I formulated the McCainGraham rule (originally the McCainGrahamLieberman rule, morphing into the McCainGrahamAyotte rule) -- whatever foreign policy prescriptions emerge from their mouths are guaranteed to be self-serving and wrong.  This rule hasn't been violated yet...Does anyone else wonder when he (and Mr. Graham, of course) will finally learn to just shut up?",@Charlie in NJ -- Name one?  Did you not see Mr. Giuliani's admiring statement about President Putin after trashing President Obama's leadership?  There's one.,"So ... not pretty.  I can think of at least three recent models for how this plays out for Russia: Afghanistan in 1979, Chechnya, and Georgia in 2008.  Of course, it's not entirely up to Mr. Putin as to which model is pursued; the Ukrainians and their neighbors have something to say about it as well.",,,

A lane on the  GW Bridge was closed for whatever reason for what ever length of time  and the left wing went into feeding frenzy for a solid month with the likes of Chris Mathews devoting entire news hours on the subject. Here we have a former President who brokered  a deal, with President Obamas approval, that gives 20 ownership of the United States uranium reserves to Mr. Putin's Russia and the left gives it a thumbs up..As an Independent I don't think I want Democrats any where near the White House ever again especially a Clinton.",EU has to stop all trade with Putin. Putin's soldiers (militants without insignia) will then be pulled back.,"Possibly naive, more likely hubristic.  We tend to have the notion that Western values and systems will always win out over more primitive values and systems, like authoritarianism, or oligarchies.  In the face of contrary evidence, we nonetheless continue to hold fast to that notion.  I agree with your proposals going forward.  There is no point in boosting Putin's stature in Russia by taking actions that will feed a national paranoia that the West is encircling Russia.  There is a lot to be gained by taking non-military actions that will impress upon Putin and his cronies that they cannot act in utter defiance of basic international norms and still benefit from international trade and finance as if nothing happened.","America has always supported free elections anywhere in the world as long as we agree with the results. If not then we declare them illegal and vow to unite the western world to put sanctions in place to punish the poor misinformed people that voted in their own interest and not Americas..Russia has been in conflict with itself since the time of  Czar Nicholas and perhaps before that but fear not we, under the leadership of President Obama, will ride to the recue and set them straight..As far as Putin is concerned, poor chap, he thinks he is the acting in his own best interest and the interest of his own country. Can you believe that? Doesn't he realize that America knows best what is good for Russia, the Ukraine and Crimea and the people who live there..He should just look at how successful we have been in transforming Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, and Syria to western style Democracies with free elections and booming economies.  That is an impressive track record wouldn't you say?.So what is to be done? Well for starters lets stop electing 2nd stringers to run our own government. Yes 2nd stringers. Our most intelligent citizens are not in politics. Next  lets try to stop being the policeman to the world. Next we should try to understand that not everyone wants to emulate America. We don't always know best. The list could go on but you get my drift..Eventually we will pay the price for our arrogance.",Putin is lost within himself; a sad place to be. May the good Russian people wake up.,Putin clearly can't be trusted. He's a narcissist with no moral compass and his ego has been bruised. A dangerous combination. The world needs to cut it's dependence on anything Russia sells until Putin can demonstrate it can be a partner of the world and not a threat.,"I hope I live to see the day Putin is extracted from a hole in which he is hiding from fellow Russians, as Saddam and Khadaphy were, by their one time reluctant supporters.","Putin owns this. European leaders could have prevented this with less concern for the flow of vodka and oil and more concern for the injustice being inflicted on Ukraine and it's people. Tougher sanctions would've worked, not extended contracts for Russian goods and services."
Expat,,,,"I don't understand how members of the EU can be opposed to the EU. At least they blew the top of Putins grand ambitions. Bankrupt Greece, divided Cyprus, autocrat Hungary. Putin sure knows how to pick winners. ..Did they completely forget how this whole mess started? Putin didn't want Ukraine to associate itself with the EU, and EU members support him. ..Putin is working to break up the EU with help from EU members. They should be asked to leave the EU or join it.","Perfect opportunity for Obama to shake hands with Putin, get out of Syria, and focus on ISIS in Iraq. The Syrian crisis belongs to Assad and the Russians.  Let the Russians and Iranians handle ISIS there. If Putin hadnt sandbagged all attempts to do something about Syria in the beginning of the conflict, it wouldn't have gone out of hand.","I'm sorry but the fear mongering is going nuts. The potential cost of increasing support for Ukraine is ridiculous. The cost is being felt already by the Ukrainians. Give them a proper chance to defend themselves. They are not even asking for that much..If Putin decides to escalate, the whole  protect Russian minorities  comes crashing down. The reason they are in a mess is because they were put in a mess. Putin doesn't care about Ukraine, he doesn't even care about Russians. He's got bigger plans.","Putin's rhetoric would not work if the US had not routinely violated international law over the last decade. America invaded Iraq without a UN resolution or a declaration of war, fights a dirty war in Pakistan, and violates the sovereignty of foreign nations at will - because it can...Now, Putin annexed Crimea - because he could - and he will set out to protect Russian minorities wherever else he can. It is in the interest of the West to stop him, but the US can no longer claim the moral high ground...Most Republicans don't care, because they think that might is right, and that Putin was emboldened by Obama looking weak. Nothing could be further from the truth. Putin was emboldened by the fact that most Europeans see America as an Evil Empire and are willing to give Putin the benefit of the doubt...I was in Germany on 911. There was an outpouring of sympathy for the US. Wherever I went, school kids were holding candle light vigils for the victims of the attacks. Now that these kids have grown up, they are making false equivalences between the USA and Russia, which are both perceived as thuggish bullies...In an age of nuclear weapons, the Cold War was always about public opinion, and the Soviet Union lost, because the people on the other side of the Iron Curtain believed that the West and democracy would serve them better. This was not achieved through tanks and news, but by being a shining example politically and economically. And this is what the US should become again.","Yes, Russian ultra-nationalism is scary, and Putin may have lost control over the spirits he summoned. But I think it's unfair to think that Russians at large subscribe to this ideology...Also, it's worth pointing out that in its more extreme, neoconservative forms, American execptionalism is just as scary as Russia's mystic messianism. Before we blame Russians for their nationalism let's take a cold hard look in the mirror, and remember that the hybris of our conservatives got us into Iraq, and caused the Great Recession, which was brought about by a quasi-religious belief in the messianic power of the market. In the end, we may be just as ideological and deluded as the Russians.","Yes, Russian ultra-nationalism is scary, and Putin may have lost control over the spirits he summoned.

It sets an unacceptable precedent. No country can be allowed to invade a neighboring country, seize a disputed territory, and annex it after a phony referendum. This so-called referendum wasn't free or fair, there were no credible foreign observers, and the result (over 90) is utterly implausible. I do not doubt that there is majority for joining Russia, but this is just laughable...Maybe Putin is reasonable and won't annex Crimea right away. Maybe there will be negotiations. But if Putin moves ahead, this will be the beginning of new Cold War.",,,
Chicago Guy,,,,I think the whole world is getting extremely tired of Putin's demands...I prefer to call him Pushpin.,"I wonder how Putin feels about his mob now?..You would think that he, of all people, would know that once a mob gets really going, it no longer listens to the guy who created it - a real mob is leaderless...A large mob in full swing is something to see...And there are few things on earth as terrifying.",Russia knows which side it's Borsht is breaded on...Anybody else notice how much Putin looks like Bush on the aircraft carrier?..Pure Agit-Prop.,Russia knows which side it's Borsht is breaded on...Anybody else notice how much Putin looks like Bush on the aircraft carrier?..Pure Agit-Prop.,Putin realized that the oil and gas wanted to be liberated even more than the people...,Putin realized that the oil and gas wanted to be liberated even more than the people...,"It seems Putin is almost as adept as George W.

norman pollack,,,,"NYT, not Putin, is selling a fantasy, a one-sided narrative of 100 Russian aggression, 0 US-EU aggression.  Here NYT had excellent coverage on NATO pre-positioning of heavy weapons, only last week, and earlier sporadic coverage of Nazi-sympathetic elements in the Kiev government, not to mention US instigation of the coup d'etat that was responsible for the present impassive...Selective journalism is not, or should not be, a mark of pride.  Why the not-so-subtle red-baiting on The Times's part?  Putin's extensive interview in an Italian newspaper deserves close reading, particularly on US-EU pipeline diplomacy to injure Russia's financial situation.  By all means, keep up the hatred, the vitriol, and the nuclear war we all fear may come to pass--at US-EU urging.","Obama criticizes Putin, ignoring his own role and that of the US in global interventions, covert actions, and regime change.  America does not have clean hands; Obama especially, with his massive surveillance at home, should be the last to criticize either Putin or Assad--his own record of confrontation with Russia and China, his boast that America has the strongest military, his militarization of trade (TPP), his general demeanor, mark him as the most belligerent, officious president in modern memory...Putin and Xi have a firm grasp of international politics, while Obama is the cowboybraggart thoroughly at home with the use of force, not to say, drone assassination.  To hear him criticize the others is sheer phoniness, as he brings America lower in the world's estimation.","Chilly relations between Obama and Putin, because Putin is among the few world leaders to see through Obama.  We speak of Ukraine as reason for freezing out Russia in world affairs, when modern Ukraine is the product of a coup, US engineered.  We also conveniently ignore the role of the US globally: war, intervention, covert action, regime change--how expect Putin to respect Obama with a record like that?..On Syria, why historically-politically the animus toward Assad?  Has US meddling in the Middle East--military bases in Saudi Arabia a causal factor in Bin Laden's rise, the Iraq intervention, the categorical defense of Israel no matter what it does--been responsible for the creation and expansion of ISIS?  American policy is proving self-devouring.  We are outraged that Putin wants to aid Assad, yet we pour billions into the campaign to oust Assad.  Inconsistency? Hypocrisy?..Obama is no match for Putin, not because Washington thinks of him as a thug, but because his actions and policies have been measured, while the US, under Obama, itches for confrontation with Russia (and China), for that matter).  Obama is driving Putin and Xi together, Syria merely one more illustration of a US international posture of intervention and regime change in pursuit of global hegemony...It won't work.","I go against the ideological tide.  Cohen with his advocacy of a military buildup in the Baltics, is warmongering pure and simple.  US-EU-NATO movement to Russia's borders, including use of B-52s in war games in Latvia, make the alliance the real provocateurs.  Rant about Ukraine, but conveniently dismiss the coup d'etat and significant neo-Nazi elements in Kiev's government...What crime has Putin committed?  Why counterrevolutionary simply because development has not been erected into the new God?  As for the Russia-China rapproachement, if it happens the cause will be Western military threats as e.g. the movement of heavy military equipment to the Russian border combined with the Obama Pacific-first strategy (which includes TPP) to contain and isolate China...The West's self-righteousness about cultural issues is leading to massive confrontation with the potential for nuclear war.  Compare this assertiveness of confrontation with Putin's more circumspect approach to world affairs.  Pace the Cohen analysis, Putin is emerging as the global statesman.","Thataway NYT, let's expand existing sanctions against Russia.  The Kievian government is simon-pure; Putin is a psychopathic dictator.  Who's kidding whom here?  You speak of casualties, yet imprecise to a journalistic fault.  Let's have a clearer breakdown.  But more, do you think Kiev would even discuss an arrangement of true federalism with respect to the eastern provinces?..Your course is one of war.  USG has been maneuvering into that situation for some time.  Have you forgotten the COUP, or do you deny its existence?  Have you forgotten Victoria Nuland and her plansactivities, or do you deny that too?  Is Russia wrong in its concern that NATO seeks troops at its borders?..Demonizing Putin is surely great fun, or has it become an addiction (in the same way The Times for decades was obsessed with Fidel)?  Before jumping into the fire that is Ukraine, ask yourself:  Are the sanctions against Russia warranted?  What of the neo-Nazis who were and are prominent in Kiev?  Is  confronting Russia part of a broader geopolitical strategy that also includes confronting China?  And why, confrontation in the first place?..Unilateral US superpower-dom, in a changing world, is no longer possible.  To then seek to enforce it, at the risk of global nuclear war, is irresponsible if not also suicidal.  Start peeling away the layers of policy, including the war on terror, and see what is before our noses: an alarming re-activation of a Cold War that indeed never fully subsided.","What remains incontrovertible is that Ukraine is Mr. Putin's war.  That sentence will go down as among the most disgraceful in NYT's history.  So cocksure, so one-sided, so obsessed with the need to demonize Putin...There was a coup--or does NYT deny it?  There are significant neo-Nazi elements in the Kiev government and as coup leaders--or does NYT deny it?  There is high probability of moving NATO forces to Russia's borders, an initiating cause of the crisis--or does NYT deny it?..Separatists?  Had Kiev provided a federalist structure, one that safeguarded Russian-language rights, would separation been  thought of?  And why is it always Putin the presumed Devil the presumed reincarnation of Stalin who is at fault?  Is US-EU-NATO-IMF collusion not involved?..The Times disgraces itself as a propaganda rag for its treatment of the crisis.","...especially encouraged from abroad.  This one-sided view of Putin ignores a central tenet of US policy: regime change.  Putin's critique of Western policy does not occur in a vacuum.  We have abetted and engineered the rise of dictators for so long; merely go back to the Shah and Pinochet...And to demonize Putin, as The Times continually does, making a mockery of its claims to objectivity and integrity, does not weigh in the analytical balance the massive NSA surveillance of the American people.  Are we a model democracy?  Our president relishes, yes, relishes, the continuation of drone assassination and covert action.  IS the CIA any more virtuous than the KGB?  Is the US military budget somehow more exhonerative than that of Russia's?..Why the unfairness in discussing world politics?  Why, using Ukraine, is there no mention of the American-sponsored coup d'etat?..Conceivably, Putin favors state power because he knows, as does much of the world, that US intervention to overthrow governments it does not favor, destroys the international battle field.","It is clear, as NYT posters exemplify, that Ukraine is a black-and-white issue, the West 100 right, Russia 100 wrong, no qualms in rendering the judgment, no reservations, just absolute certainty in the West's moral rightness.  The Times contributes to that moral absolutism, demonizing Putin in the process...To say otherwise makes one a Stalinist or moral criminal.  I guess I should wear a striped suit with a picture of Uncle Joe on a t-shirt.  Ukraine is a potential seedbed for WWIII and nuclear conflagration.  Why? Because it is the the proxy context for NATO's clustering on the Russian border, and because it is part of the US geopolitical strategy for promoting Russia's decline (similarly, Obama's Pacific-first strategy for China's decline)...Why deny the obvious?  The US seks the RESTORATION of its unilateral global supremacy. This is no longer possible in a changing world power-structure, not only the two major designated enemies, but other rising powers leading to a multi-polar global framework.  The fact that the US has joined with (perhaps pressured) the EU to adopt a hostile stand--neither Nuland nor the COUP is a figment of my imagination, nor for that matter, neo-Nazis presence in the Kiev government--toward Russia, doesn't seem to matter in the West.  Deniability is the handmaid of the geostrategic posture...So be it.  I alone can make no difference.  Let the historical wheels grind on to the inevitable debacle--and worse.","Why the decline in the value of the ruble?  Why that of oil prices?  The vultures (USEU) are circling the wagons--everything, through concerted plan, to disrupt the Russian economy and DESTROY Russia.  The Times here and esp. in its editorial uses such emotionally colored words as to suggest uncontrolled hatred.  Kill, exterminate, crush , even praising Chechen Islamist terrorists for their crimes in Grozny..This, objective reporting?  Yes, sanctions hurt; not a word as to their illegality and effect on the people.  Russia, the punching bag: Inflict all harm possible, and rid the world of  Demon Putin.  Putin represent openness and the West is forcing him to adopt Autarky, a dangerous game, and my earnest hope is that he cuts off natural gas supplies to Europe altogeth, given Europe's blind following of US leadership.  Yes, let's get those Nazis back into Kiev (they're already there!)...The Saudis are flooding the world oil market at US bidding--anything to  crush Russia.  My take: Putin shows remarkable forbearance in the face of political-economic encirclement.  Perhaps Merkel will see the follydanger in the course followed and break away from the pack of jackals.  (Yes, your terms are loaded, so why cannot mine be--jackals, wolves, vultures, anything but constructive statesmen?)  Obama moves steadily Rightward on all fronts; Putin represents steadiness in the world system--a position easy to ridicule, as NYT is doing.","In furtherance of the West's intention to weaken and cripple Russia, South Stream will not be built.  Ironically, ideology trumps the people's welfare--anti-Russian policy has killed the much-needed supply of natural gas to Western Europe.  Putin's concept of the project and rates were not unreasonable, but now, construction halted, Europe will pay the price for its animus toward Russia and Putin.  Here perhaps Merkel may, out of German self-interest, straighten matters out.  Otherwise, hostilities will continue to build, the makings of a New Cold War ready to hand...The US charges crony capitalism, when what is the whole massive defense sector in America (and construction abroad) but crony capitalism.  Concerted action by the US, Saudi Arabia, etc., has depressed world prices of oil: again, for purposes of injuring Russia.  Thus energy policy is a two-way street, for Russia can shift the direction of its distribution to China, cement a geopolitical relation with China long delayed or thought  unworkable, and thereby change the world structure of power.  Whatever America does that is hostile and vindictive will surely back-fire, justifiably so.  Intervention, regime change, covert operations, drone assassination, singly and together, hardly should be awarded top prize in global good citizenship...The more America demonizes Russia, the further its world power will recede;  such behavior risks the onset of war.  American cynicism is manifest in the pursuit of global hegemony."
Richard Muller,,,,"This is all simply a diversionary tactic of the evil little genius Vlad Putler, he's simply up to his old tricks again. Pretend like you want to back off while letting your men continue with their work. This makes it seem as if Putin is not in control of the separatists and that they are acting on their own (hence the will of the people and not the Kremlin).","Now that the West blatantly let the Annexation happen and imposed punitive sanctions on only 21 people instead of the proposed 130...I am worried about the safety of the Ukrainians that did not want to join Russia and live in Crimea as well as the entire Crimean Tatar population which are openly against the Russian invaders...If Putin indeed want's to resurrect the USSR then he will also employ USSR tactics which means he will either commit genocide against the Ukrainians and Tatars or send them somewhere to Siberia perhaps to work in his Gas factories as slaves instead of gulags. Likewise, the fate of the Ukrainians service men serving at the various military stations blocked by the Russians also does not look very bright.","Yanukovich (on behalf of Overlord Putin) stripped Ukraine of any ability to have a stable economy or a capable military...The current Kiev government had to pick up the broken pieces and work from there which we all see it is barely able to do. Now the US and Russia step in, one not knowing to what degree it should be involved in the matter and the other having already charted out the plans for Ukraine's future dictates the rules of the game. The United States need to take a firm stance with Putin and not negotiate with a terrorist because that is the only thing that you can call Putin today after everything that he has done.","You act as if the article mentions the effect of Russia's sanctions of America and Europe instead of the other way around...don't try to paint a different picture than what is currently playing out today, and that is the negative effect that the sanctions are having on Putin's inner circle. Don't think that they will not put him down, if they feel threatened by the recklessness of his actions. They may have risen to power with his aide but they will not hesitate for a second to betray him if it means saving their fortunes and assets. That is how an Oligarchic system works and Putin know it.",,,,,,
Bill Appledorf,,,,"Mr. Putin is not the only person who wants a federation with regional autonomy as opposed to a strong central government in Ukraine. Ethnic Russians, Russian speakers, and others in the east and south want to put this to a vote...Why do the USA, EU, and NATO characterize Mr. Putin's support for self-determination by these actors aggression? This accusation strikes me as aggressive and ignores the aspirations of the people who live there.","Washington, and by extension the NY Times, apparently think that Vladimir Putin is stupid. ..Why on Earth would Russia move west and attempt to annex pro-Western provinces that feel antipathy to Russia and to him?..Eastern provinces, with affinity for Russia and reviled by Kiev, are under attack from the West, and the U.S. is so dead-set on war with Russia it will not grant autonomy to Eastern Ukraine and call it a day...Washington always blames its aggression on soneone else, and its story, on calm inspection, is always risible.","Russian aid to Eastern Ukraine being shelled by Kiev, bad..U.S. aid to Kiev doing the shelling, good...Shelling in Russia's border..Shelling...And all because Eastern Ukraine wants autonomy under a federation, which Putin has supported from the git-go...Why does the USA reject autonomy and a federation?.Why does the USA want Ukraine in NATO?..Why does NATO even exist given that the USSR and the Warsaw Pact disappeared from the face of the Earth almost 30 years ago?","Russia lost 27 million people (11 million civilians) defeating the Nazis in WWII. By contrast the USA lost a total of 500,000 fighters in Europe and the Pacific. Leave aside Napoleon's invasion of Russia. In 1991, 25 million Russians living in the Soviet Republics found themselves living abroad instantly when the USSR fell. These are enormous shocks to a population, and Putin is the head of state of the nation that has experienced these things. ..In ancient times Russia was invaded by Teutons, Mongols, and other ambitious hoards who tried to conquer and enslave the Russian people. The idea of love for Mother Russia is deeply woven into the soul of the Russian people because it has deep historical roots. This makes Putins responsibility to his people ancient, deep, and serious. ..What Putin does and what he thinks is to promote and the defend the prosperity and security of the Russian people. His responsibility is not to promote or defend the aims of the USA. That infuriates right-wing Americans, who believe the world revolves around the USA and that everyone is obliged to answer to the USA. So there is a lot of anti-Putin rhetoric in the USA. Putin has plenty of flaws and plenty of faults, but looking out for Russia and not kowtowing to the USA is not one of them.","President Obama has plenty of real enemies to do battle with, but they scare him so much he invents one: Vladimir Putin...Mr. Putin has displayed zero explicit hostility toward Mr. Obama or the USA, and yet we are treated to a never-ending drumbeat of Russian aggression, Russian aggression. Separatists in Eastern Ukraine are not marionettes whose strings are in Vladimir Putin's hands. As in every instance of conflict on the world stage, the situation is complex. It has a history, overlapping factions, subtleties, degrees...But no. Barack Obama and American media portray foreign relations as cowboy movies: black hat, white hat. Our guy, their guy. I don't know whether to be disgusted or depressed by the endless posturing and twisted excuses for journalism in the American press...Obama's enemies: Republicans in the U.S. Congress. Somehow political expediency limits how daring he dares to be on the domestic stage, but he will risk the dollar, risk nuclear war, risk American prosperity, risk humiliation piled on humiliation for the USA on the world stage to maintain the illusion that Russian aggression is what is going on in the Ukraine and that Barack Obama in the white hat is courageously confronting Mr. Putin in the black hat...This is nonsense of the highest order, and it makes me shake my head with pursed lips.","The NY Times and the rest of American corporate media long ago decided that ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine who reject Maidan, Kiev, the IMF, the World Bank, the USA, the EU, and NATO have no agency of their own and are puppets of Vladamir Putin...Cold War ideology rejects reality and creates a reality of its own. This is what we lived with from 1945 to the collapse of the Soviet Union, including capitalist triumphalist claims that the USA defeated the USSR after it collapsed...You can't reason with ideologues. Facts don't matter. Mr. Putin is the antichrist. Mr. Putin is calling the shots in Ukraine, and he is doing it to deprive the USA and its allies of their just deserts...Has it never occurred to anyone in the American media or the EU or NATO that there are people on this planet who don't want anything to do with you?","Mr. Putin explained his reasoning for military intervention in Syria in his recent 60 Minutes interview with Charlie Rose. It is the same rationale that W. Bush invoked when he invaded Afghanistan: fight them on their home soil, not on his. ..In Russia's case, although I personally believe that military escalation by any outside power in the Middle East -- as opposed to cultivating diplomacy among the regional powers -- is exactly the wrong policy, based on prior experience with horrific acts of terrorism on Russian soil and Russia's geographical proximity to the region, jihadis infiltrating Russia poses a credible and serious threat.","I find it wearisome being one tiny voice protesting incessant Putin bashing in the pages of the NY times. Mr. Putin should know that for one reader of this newspaper time does not begin when the NY Times says it does...Mr. Putin took Crimea because his national security was threatened. His navy was tied up in a base nominally under control of a government that had assumed power in the wake of a violent coup supported by the USA...U.S. aggression always comes masked by accusations of aggression by the target of U.S. aggression. There is always a Tonkin Gulf, a mushroom cloud smoking gun, an imminent invasion of Texas by the USSR...Mr. Putin is responsible for the interests of Russia on a world stage that is dominated by the ruthlessness, violence, and duplicity of the USA. Russia is not Shangrila, and I doubt if Russia claims to be. But the relentless hostility of the USA toward Russia and its leadership is, as I said, tiring...The USA does not have oligarchs sucking the life blood out of the American body politic? The American oligarchs go one better: they suck the life out of the entire world. Russian violence? Yes, Chechnya has been devastated. Need we mention Iraq? And that is just for starters...The sanctimony wears thin after a while. All this carrot-and-stick talk in American-Russian relations is predicated on the unremitting hostility of the USA towards Russia. Full stop. Absent that there is no issue that the U.S. and Mr. Putin could not resolve.","Why is the NY Times trying to whip up animosity toward Vladimir Putin? ..The interminable pretexts of the USA, most recently in Venezuela, get full-throated support, but Russia's legitimate concerns are portrayed ceaselessly as illegitimate threats by a bullying bogeyman...If I were Mr. Putin, seeing NATO pushed up against my borders in the Baltic states, having fended off unnecessary and supposedly defensive anti-ballistic missiles proposed to be stationed in Ukraine during George W. Bush's administration, and hearing the inevitable linking of so-called security arrangements by the West with economic agreements between Ukraine and the West before Yanukovich's fall, I would be thinking seriously about the security of my population and my natural resources...Interminable demonizing of Russian and Mr. Putin by propaganda outlets such as the NY Times would increase my worries that the ever-aggressive USA has plans -- the usual plans couched in pretexts, half-truths, lies, and distortions...Why is Russia viewed as a adversary by the USA? Why is Russia not viewed as a partner? Because American economic and foreign policy needs an enemy. Why else does the USA, a shamefully crumbling, brutally unjust empire, spend 10 times as much on its military as the next 10 nations combined?","Russia is a sparsely populated, underdeveloped country that possesses enormous mineral and hydrocarbon wealth...Despite George H.W. Bush's verbal promise to Mikhail Gorbachev not to expand NATO onto Russia's doorstep, pushing NATO up against Russia's nose is precisely what the USA has done, under exactly what pretext is not clear...Does the EU's offer to rape -- I mean assist --- Ukriane with loans predicated on economic austerity and cooperation on  matters of security mean that Ukraine,  the doorway through which Napoleon, the Kaiser, and Hitler all invaded Russia, will be incorporated into NATO?..Would the USA welcome Russian military bases in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean?..You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, especially if you are Vladamir Putin , who is being demonized in the American press as the next Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, and Slobodan Miloevi all rolled into one."
trudds,,,,"The same pro-Russian voices that jump up defending poor Mother Russia at every chance are back and more strident than ever. If only your voices actually represented anything besides Mr. Putins desires to recreate a modern Greater Russian empire I would be very more sympathetic. But this is about much more than just Ukraine. Every bordering country has become more than a little concerned about the aggressive behavior coming from the Kremlin and rightfully so. I certainly don't want a war with anyone but it appears that only the same kind of military power Mr. Putin uses and displays to get what he wants is the only kind of power he respects. To show any thing else, will only result in more aggression on his part.",The many Russian apologists who regularly wait for these articles in the NYTimes to defend Putin's actions will certainly be able to spin this. But for most of us its only a reminder that sometimes things aren't about the US or NATO or the UN but a man with a mission to recreate an empire.,"As much as I appreciate the readers' tendencies here to blame the US for             most misdeeds since the Big Bang andor show a deep and abiding respect for Mr. Putin's sphere of influence, forgive me if I side with the majority of Eastern Europeans who seem to have a keener grasp of recent geopolitics in their neighborhood. If asked to pick between the Russians and Mr. Putin or the US and western society as a whole for their path forward it would seem the choice seems relatively clear to them for all our flaws..Ukraine, at least the part not controlled by ethic Russians needed no western encouragement to overthrow their government, and still struggles to deal with it's Soviet Era problems. That's just the latest though perhaps the messiest example of throwing off the former communist authoritarianism. The other countries that have already done so have no desire to go back that I can see and i hope the west continues to include them as possible in our collective vision of the future.","Is there any real understanding of Mr. Putin here? Sure he's a wonderful ally as long as it furthers his agenda, but it stops there. He wants what he wants and he will go after it until the price gets too high to pay. Economic sanctions are the best way to raise the price without pushing military tensions further. If the serious thinkers here would like to wring their hands about how the US is worse knock yourselves out. But stop blaming us for the fact most of Eastern Europe like us better and fears Russia much more. Stop saying those countries have no choice but to turn back to Russia for their future.  Stop making this about former US foreign policy, it's about him.","Speaking of musing from a far political wing, nice to know we have the left view point covered here as well. The only thing we agree on is that Iraq is not Crimea. Feel free to dislike the former president's foreign policy, it seems tragic at best and violently counterproductive most of the time. So back to 2014, you don't see the hand of Putin in the violence in eastern Ukraine? Invasion, occupation? I suppose those gentlemen in the full combat gear and ski masks were just visiting from the Olympics?","Well, to his credit,Mr. Putin did keep talking about the fascists in the west. Now we know it really wasn't Kiev he was talking about.","This has so little to do with the West, yet so many voices are still ready to tilt this to their agenda, whether hawk, dove, liberal, or conservative. There need to be a much stronger effort to realize many countries don't wake up and g yo bed thinking about the US or the other Western countries. Please tart studying up on Russia and Mr. Putin if you would like to create a much more accurate perspective. If you have some more spare time, you can learn the regional history to the East is deep, rich and often not about us.","Sorry, I appreciate this post's popularity but you stretch your analogies much too far. This isn't Georgia, those guys aren't Blackwater, and those exercises aren't anything like the B-52s over the East China Sea. This reporting is about as neutral as you can get when the facts are rather few and far between. What's obvious is Putin and Russia want Crimea and they're going yo get it. You disagree? The people of Ukraine (you know, the one's who are actually Ukrainian and of course the Tatars) do not want to be part of Russia.

Let me add a proscription against playing domestic politics on the matter.  If necessary, talk tough to Putin privately. Do not publicly laud his toughness simply to denigrate Obama.  Economic challenges it could not meet and oppression of its population brought the USSR down. They will also curb Putin and his vision of Russia in due course.","After the collapse of the USSR  the predecessors to today's  hard right neo-cons wanted to weaken and humiliate Russia. No, all that is bad is not the fault of the USA, but we could have been  more deft,  more aware of Russian sensitivities, not to mention interests. Poland, fine, Czechoslovakia (now the Czeck Republic and Slovakia) fine, even the Baltic states fine.  western Ukraine fine. To speak of the will of the Ukrainian people and democracy in the current crisis is to be willfully ignorant of the east - west divide in The Ukraine just as  to speak of Putin's dictatorship and denial of human rights in Russia is to overlook the east-west divide in Russia, not to mention the possible further fragmentation of Russia by rebellious elements in border areas. Putin has very strong support in Russia just as the recently overthrown government in Ukraine has support among Ukrainians.  We here in the USA should not view the situation through the now ancient lenses of the Cold War. We should not be so eager to see a reincarnation of Stalin in Putin - not that he is a soft, fuzzy nice guy.  And let's keep our domestic politics out of it. We  are  not going to send American troops into the Crimea, nor are we going to send armed drones over. Republicans don't want to do that either, but they will be all too happy to denounce Obama for being weak. We should try to facilitate calm, pragmatic relations among the people  of the Ukraine and between the Ukraine and Russia.","The realities which deter the USA and western Europe from effective deterrence of Russia in the Ukraine could have been and should have been anticipated in the aftermath of the fall of the USSR. But no, in the euphoria of winning the Cold War we had to treat it as a sports event and in effect run around shouting we're number 1 and seek to humiliate Russia to the maximum degree. Now that we are getting the blowback we should have foreseen, we have a choice - wait for Putin to set his own limits or be ready for the long feared nuclear holocaust.  Bill Clinton told us the global economy would prevent war by establishing interdependence - oh, really?  It has created vulnerabilities for us, but not Russia.  When Obama says that the first proposition should be do no harm, he is right, but macho  cowboys who actually stay at home when war commences don't  like it.","It is discouraging that so many Russians can be directed away from their own deprivation of rights and democracy by Putin's toking up the jingoism of nationalisticgreat power aspiration, but we cannot deny that the same process works here in the USA among many Americans. We are quick to buy into the falsehood of Saddam's possession of weapons of mass destruction. Would our own leaders lie to us?  Or  the efficacy of a surge rather  the ignominy of cutting  and running. Or the hypocrisy that our employment of torture is not torture because we don't practice torture, i.e., water-boarding is not torture because  we don't practice torture.  That torture must yield positive results because otherwise why would we do it. Any evidence that it does not yield positive benefits to our interests must be denied.","Why does anyone -Obama or McCain - have to say anything about military action on behalf of Crimea or Ukraine.  Let Putin think that a military response is possible if he acts further against Ukraine, but don't encourage Ukraine to think military action on her behalf is possible if she provokes Russia.  People talk too much for domestic politics and domestic media attention.","During the Cold War Era hard-line anti-communistsanti-Russians in this country took what they liked from George Kennan, that is hem the USSR in with NATO members on its western borders and apply pressure called containment,bid up our nuclear power to encircle the USSR, but rejected what they did not like, that is  make sure we kept faith with our own democratic traditions and principles both at home and  abroad. Some of our hardliners even deplored the term containment in favor of a more aggressive sounding roll back the iron curtain which, of course we would not execute when the East Germans, Hungarians, and Czechs proved restless, respectively, in 1953, 1956, and 1968.  Now again we are not in a position to act aggressively against Putin's Russia on behalf of Crimea, nor Eastern Ukraine.  And so, we should not.  But let's not keep grasping at straws when everyone knows we will not  match Russian tanks with NATO tanks Russian manpower with NATO manpower.  That only emboldens Putin. Ukraine will crumble away until  we can establish a defensible perimeter )call it  containment) and until domestic conditions in Ukraine and in Russia  bring about the eruption of democracy again. Like the old containment, this new containment is going to cost us in resources and tensions and time.","McCain shares the same view of human nature and what constitutes power as Putin. Then he undercuts his point by taking military power off the table. Of course, we could destroy Russia militarily as we could China and Syria, as we could have North Korea and North Vietnam and Iran and Iraq and Afghanistan etc., etc. just unleash our full technological, nuclear arsenal. It's just that there might not be much of a world left thereafter, and it is not the way reasonably enlightened people want to move toward a more peaceful, more humane world, if, indeed that is possible given the continuing prevalence of a McCainPutin, popular culture, World Wrestling Federation, NFL, etc.,etc., view of what constitutes manhood, strength, machismo,  etc.,etc.  It is just unfathomable that so-called responsible leaders in the USA have openly expressed their admiration for Putin's leadership and denigrate Obama's efforts as showing weakness.",I am dismayed to see comments publicly proclaiming the need to give Putin a graceful way out. Even the likes of former Secretaries of State Baker and Kissinger have said this. I have yet to see any indication that Putin is looking for a way out. He is merely exploiting any weakness he perceives in the western reaction as well as the geographical circumstances that play to his favor. Let's not overestimate Russia's strengths and competence as we did during much of the Cold War.  Putin is continuing to be provocative.  He needs to feel some pressure before we start offering him a way out.,
muezzin,,,,"I don't see a problem here. What Putin is doing  is in the  interest of Russia - securing a friendly outpost in the Eastern Mediterranean and reinforcing the Orthodox Alliance. ..Cyprus is getting a handout.  the Greeks want one too. As do the Serbs,   Bulgarians and  Czechs. Everyone gets something out of the Russian connection. Except the Russian people who are being manipulated and robbed.","Putin is essentially testing how far will the West allow him to go. If he can take apart Ukraine, how will NATO respond when little green men start to appear in Lithuania and Estonia?..It is just a matter of time that Russian speaking minorities demand their 'rights' to 'self-determination'.  ..As for the the 'rebels', many will return to their Motherland. The locals will try to eek a living in an unrecognized thuggocracy dependent on Russian aid. Is it really worth it?","Putin is the proverbial scorpion crossing the river on the frog's back. Unless there is a strong counter-push he will keep pushing... because that's in his nature. ..EU and US are not making things easier by refusing to draw a line in the sand. What Ukrainian military needs is (1) Better command structure; (2) Better logistics and (3) Much better weapons. The West should give them the truth - fire the corrupt, fat, old-style generals who still believe in tank warfare; develop a new doctrine with the aim to make victories too expensive for the Russians. And offer Mariupol to the 6th Fleet.","We simply cannot do this physically, because Russia is not a participant in this conflict...One can tell a lot by the political culture in a country by scrutinizing the manner of lying by its officials. Russian lying, for example, is tragicomical as its politician and aparatschik's alike treat the truth as a traceable commodity without intrinsic value.  As long as the US does not step in for real, providing actual military assistance, Putin will take the West for credulous fools. ..The clearest similar example is probably the Bosnian war where the only effect of the myriad EU resolutions and pleas was to make Serbs laugh. Until Clinton stepped in - that's when the Serbs stopped laughing and started to run.","Its a decision to make our criminal justice policy more humane, Mr. Putin said ..Humane? Russia is a kleptocracy. The 'criminal justice system' is designed to keep the mafiosi on the top, including the kleptocrat-in-chief.","an unnamed source from the Russian Defense Ministry as saying the men had crossed into Ukraine by accident......While this may seem bizarre to the outsider, for putinists lying is just the way things are done in Russia. You do it because you can. You do it because people demand to be brainwashed and Putin provides the service. ..Simple conscripts like the ones captured by the Ukrainians are, as they correctly realize, cannon fodder.  They were forced into the charade and now they continue to be pawns in the lyingprevarication game played by the Kremlin. It'd be funny if it were;t sad, as Putin plays with lives of millions of people without caring in any way about their well-being.",Putin has determined- correctly - that the West will squeal but largely  leave the Ukrainians to their fate. He probably would not be doing it with President McCain.,"This is an obvious attempt to insinuate a Trojan horse (or in this case, trucks) into the conflict. The moment one of the trucks gets shot at (most likely by the insurgents themselves) Putin will get his excuse to invade. ..Given what Putin did with his own (Chechen) rebels, his concern for the Ukrainians appears completely disingenuous. The man essentially razed Grozny to the ground. Unfortunately, Ukrainians have no good options here. There best shot is to do a Blitzkrieg and overrun Lugansk and then place EU and US observers around Donetsk and the border if they can.","@Michael:..The locals have been exposed to unrelenting stream of propaganda and lies (fascists etc) from Moscow, in addition to the infiltration of Russian spies, special ops, gangsters and soldiers. If this was Chechnya or Dagestan, these protesters would have been shot, or worse. ..Sadly, Putin and the Chinese (as well as the ineffectual and effete Europeans) show us that credible threat of force is (still) the only way to keep the bad guys at bay.",

Yet Putin surely knows that Obama saw this coming, ergo (shudder) the fracked US hinterlands &amp; it's poisoned water now produces more natural gas than Russia.

Putin -- less recently known as the Butcher of Chechnaya, and the author of spontaneous rebellions by Russophones in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Dagestan, and Ukraine -- would certainly have no objection to Assad's war crimes and human rights violations. Putin has a clear motive in aligning against IS, which could easily expand onto Russia's southern flank, where poorly armed and weakly organized Muslim provincial governments might strengthen or absorb Russian puppet governments. Russia has absolutely no interest in a moderate Syrian replacement for Assad's brutality.","1. Iran signs nuclear deal and will receive 100 billion in frozen funds..2. Iran goes to Moscow and holds talks with Putin who then starts sending military equipment to Syria. (How much did the Iranians pay Russia?).3. US announces they share a common goal with Russian of creating a new 'secular' government to all of Syria but disagree over whether Asad should lead it..So now Obama has stated his intention to do more nation building in Syria by imposing a 'democratic' secular government of national unity. Since we will never commit any troops there, it looks to me like we are setting the country up to be taken over by Iran.","Of the 295 dead, most were Europeans. However limp-wristed Europeans will just sit by, trembling in fear of great Russia and her bountiful natural resources. ..The world can do nothing against a man as powerful as Putin. We should just accept that Russia has permanently absorbed Crimea and Putin can do whatever he wishes because no country dares get into a military conflict with Russia and sanctions are a laughing matter for Putin.","No one in the West ever bothered to verify whether the well armed forces in east Ukraine are really Pro-Russian Separatists. Western media just picked up on Russian news channels the chant and kept fanning the flames by showing all the actions of the armed militants as a protest against Kiev. The fact of the matter is there was no precedent for a civil war in east Ukraine. Donetsk and Lugansk showed no signs of descent until they were overrun by armed militants on tanks (just like in Crimea). The West needs to understand that this whole separatists talk is just a Russian smoke screen to once again invade Ukraine. Do coal miners with drill machines become professional soldiers overnight? Do they learn to use tanks, artillery and missiles basically overnight? The reason that people believed this separatist nonsense is because nobody cared to investigate,in person, on location, the events in east Ukraine. The Russian army is running the show in east Ukraine and Putin will not stop just because we ask him. Now the world knows that you can't just ignore a massive military buildup because it complicates life. By ignoring it things only get worse.","And what if we ever need gas before the time of Putin being ousted? I think in your proposal you have not considered the parametric chaos of such a complex system as the global economy &amp; geopolitical balance, and the implications of making such a brutish move.","Except that Putin only issued that request for postponement to make the world believe he has minimal influence on the separatists (he also said he was pulling back from the border, which did not happen). Similarly, this time he is again buying time and letting the vote sink in, and when Ukraine tries to suppress secessionists he will intervene. It is time to stop listening to what Putin says and analyze what he actually does, especially in light of what he has done in every other similar situation.","Anyone who believes that Putin doesn't want to annex eastern Ukraine is living in a fantasy world and it will become apparent soon. The Kremlin knows how to do this - you don't just say yes we will take eastern Ukraine 24 hours after a hasty vote. You wait for the conflict to restart and then go in protecting the will of the people. The farce of a vote provides the legitimacy, pro-Russian and Anti-Kiev propaganda ensures support, and the dumbfounded west and powerless Kiev interim government ensures little resistance. Everybody was just as incredulous about Crimea, and within a week it was over and part of new Russia..If the eastern regions only wanted more independence there are more peaceful ways to accomplish that, especially considering that the Kiev government is only Interim. The only thing that heavily armed takeover of police and government buildings is meant to lead to is annexation, and Russia is about 75 of the way there already. You will see in a week or so."
dg,,,,"President Putin does not represent any threat to the U.S. as a result of these events in the Crimea and his time will pass.  His comments in the Kremlin do show him to be more of a bitter man reacting to what he see as past slights than the cool calculating geo-politician that many have judged him to be, which is a useful insight.  One thing I would urge our (the U.S.) government to do is to move with all speed to restore a U.S. ability to put our own people into earth orbit and to access the International Space station.","It has become obvious that President Putin &amp; many of his generation in Russia have bitter memories of the end of the Cold War, &amp; view life in the Soviet Union with rose-tinted glasses.  We should get along with these types where we can, ignore them when we should, and wait for the first true post-Soviet generation to rise to leadership.  There are a lot of younger Russians that very much want to be an integral part of the modern world, &amp; their time will come.","Edward Snowden made a very bad mistake in taking part in President Putin's show if it was his choice to do so.  I was a supporter of his because I believe in the free flow of information without the hindrance of the world's security agencies, but he has totally destroyed his credibility due to the prearranged nature of his role.  Was he impelled or even forced to participate by his keepers?","This article makes it clear that President Putin has not changed his reasoning or attitude at all.  The move to phone President Obama was probably just an effort to make the Russian government seem more malleable. There is certainly nothing wrong with talking, but the effort by the Russian President to raise new territorial issues is very troubling.  I am not one of those who is making analogies between this situation, and the infamous meeting in Munich in 1938, but promises from that time about making no more territorial claims in Europe does start echoing here.","If the some members of the Ukrainian military are unwilling to fight, then perhaps the objectives of the Ukrainian government in the conflict are mistaken and western support for it should be re-examined.  This doesn't mean we have to approve of Russian conduct or accept it.  As long as President Putin and his government are in place in Russia, they should be persona non grata in all civil multi-national gatherings.","Looking at this problem from a strictly American point of view, I would urge our government not to get involved in this situation any more than they have, do not supply the Ukrainians with arms, and don't impose any more sanctions on Russia or any of its citizens.  The Ukraine is not our ally.  Those who are have the protection of NATO.  Russia poses no existential threat to the U.S on this issue; there is no abiding threat to export ideology or revolution, as in the days of the Soviet Union.  Now that there is no doubt about the true face of President Putin and his version of Russia, the best thing to do is to wait out his time.  He's not going to be in charge forever, and there is no succession system in place that will impose another like him on Russia.",,,,

I am of part Jewish descent and when on the RT website and providing comments, I have met with the most vociferous antisemitic comments I have ever experienced. Do you take no note of the open letter that the leaders of Ukraine's Jewish community wrote to President Putin (and placed in newspapers around the World including the Moscow Times) stating that the civil authorities are in control of the situation in Ukraine and they do not fear antisemitism from the current government or pro-democracy protesters. They are more concerned about the right wing neo-nazis that are regularly encouraged by the Russian governemnt, such as the Eurasian Youth movement paramilitary and certainly do not want to be incorporated into Russia. Do you take note of the number of Jewish governors, and members of cabinet including the deputy Prime Minister who are Jews in the new government. Please stop spouting nonsense that is so one sided.

It undermines official Russian claims that Russian is not a party to this conflict as Putin lied today in Minsk. I believe it is consistent with the information that Shanch is providing from Ukraine and his knowledge of Donbass and friends who live there. ..Considerably more reliable than Mr. Stackhouse's observations about hard evidence. In any common law system of criminal law, there is no such concept. There is direct and circumstantial evidence. Witness statements can be either.

Europeans are reulctant to do anything that would interfere with their oil supply yet Mr. Putin has doubled the price of oil to Ukraine since this standoff started.  The unregulated top 1 global financial elite - most of who are Wall Street based - have no social conscience and will do whatever it takes to anyone in the world to further fatten their disgracefully bloated pockets.  It is time to get them back under control.","Here is the crux of the problem, Mr. Yakunin said the United States and its allies in Europe control a global financial oligarchy that is determined to protect its political and economic domination of the world.  Yes, that is true and before we continue to try to demonize Russia and Mr. Putin too much let's see a list of the 85 individulas like the Koch brothers  in the United States, ,   Europe and allied countries who own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population and are trying to destroy governments in Italy, Spain, Greece and emerging markets for personal gain through predatory capitalism.  This fight is about the top 1 global financial elite and serves no purpose for average people around the world but we get to pay for it.  Look at the chart of countries dependent on Russian oil.  Most of them will either stay neutral or side with Russia and we will alientate even more previously friendly countries.  Let's top escalating tensions - no one in their right minds wants WWIII.",,,,,,

dz,,,,Which part of reasoned policy does Machiavelli's Prince Putin understand?,Yanukovich had campaigned on bringing Ukraine closer to the E.U.  The Ukrainian demonstrations protested his move towards Putin's autocracy. That Yanukovich fled the country and left a vacuum filled by his opposition is his own fault.,"Ukraine is Russias single biggest national security issue beyond its borders. ..Could someone explain how this is accurate? Is it because NATO could court Ukraine to expand there, and thus be a threat to Russia?..If so, I'm not sure how the Obama administration would be able to focus on supporting Kiev rather than punishing Moscow, as Mr. Bremmer advises, without pushing Putin to be even more aggressive anyway...If Putin does not hear any threats or warnings, he will move forward against other sovereign nations, to the detriment of the long term interests of the U.S.","How can the innocent victims in the Malaysian jetliner not impress on Putin that this useless contest must be ended now?..Useless contest is not a fair or accurate characterization of the situation in Ukraine. It is a slap in the face of hundreds of Ukrainians who have died so far in fighting Putin's hegemony...Putin is a menace to stability and democracy in the world, while we sit back and fluff off his gambits of force.","Theres also the not incidental matter of the international nonproliferation movement and how compromised it will be if Ukraine, having given up its nuclear weapons, doesnt get the protection it was promised in exchange...This issue gets very little coverage in the media, and yet it is crucial to U.S. long-term interests around the world. ..Putin has sent his troops into Crimea, all the while denying they are from Russia as they have cowardly removed their insignia; he has bussed in Russians to stir up political rallies and forcibly take over political institutions there; Putin's regime is preparing a new law that would enable Russia to accept as part of their own territories from other countries who democratically vote on sucession. Putin has a mighty fist, but we stand down to it at our own risk.",Thank you for your clarity and frankness here and in other editorials describing the situation in Ukraine that Vladimir Putin is scheming. ..Putin is a menace to his own people and the people around him.,"Russia apparently has had democratic structures in place for Kennan to have said Russias democracy is as far advanced, if not farther, as any of these countries weve just signed up to defend from Russia. However, Putin has taken over and laid waste to those structures by fixing elections, imprisoning journalists and dissenters, strong-arming the judicial system, etc. The U.S. should promote democracy but undermine Putin.",The wrongs of the West don't make Putin right.,,

The Netherlands is its largest trading partner. (What does that say for Russia's economy?) Since the last century, it has been unable to feed itself without major imports of grain. Its main economic product is oil and gas--sold to Western Europe--NATO. it does not produce competitive global brands in consumer goods, machine parts, technology; it is imploding from organized corruption, and has falling domestic consumption...Putin followed the despot's template: invade another country to mask the failures at home; play hero by turning back the self-conceived threat. He saved 15 billion and may gain valuable pipelines.","European party leaders are masters at the non-specific, using symbols as shorthand for hard policy and critical details...As Barack is the symbol of all that is wrong and dangerous in the world, a minority come to power in the great country of European heritage, a blow to their most cherished legacy of the nation, its history and its whiteness; Putin emerges as a Hollywood icon, a pale Russian who takes little gruff, talks and acts tough, and spits in America's (and the interloper Barack's) eye. ..Even US Republicans and conservative pundits have shown glee at the immorality of man whose leadership is mainly the endorsement or agitation of criminal actions and intimidation, using force that threatens European peace and will lead every country to big increase in the price of natural gas in succeeding winters...The groups on the far right are incredibly naive about wealth and economic policy and have resisted coming up to speed, preferring to repeat views with examination, avoiding answers to legitimate questions. They all reject the paternalism of the white man's burden, but stand firmly opposed to equality or diversity...All the far right groups, here or abroad, claim the nation's name, but are interested in power and harbor an open or down low interest in ethnic cleansing. Putin is their saint. Barack is their devil. That's an oversimplification. But not by much.","Putin has demonstrated he will commit troops to further his takeover of the sovereignty of Ukraine. He has deployed troops in a variety of ways: at check points they created, stopping traffic by the authority of force;  at government buildings, military posts and bases; as unidentified defense units kidnaping political opponents...Putin's diplomacy is groundless; he has consistently breached his promises, offering the well-worn justifications of despots who violate global law, and he has refused to enter into negotiations with any nation or organization, either Ukraine or the UN, He will use the fake referendum as a stepping stone...Russia's export trade is driven by oil and gas and could be diverted to Asia with work. Russia's domestic economy, already in shambles, would see little change from Western embargoes and boycotts...Those who blame Obama have presented no alternative, willingly to conceal their own surfeit of ideas behind loud criticism. Russia has returned to the 19th century where military threats and war were the keys to power...Putin has no shame, and Russia has plenty of power, personnel, and shells. Without a direct challenge of force, Putin will not remove his troops. He wants to win, but he probably doesn't want war. So far, his position is being accommodated. The status quo will change only if confrontation is engaged to see who really wants war less...Facing a direct threat in a country whose sovereignty he violated, Putin might back down.","An old Russian hand, Talbott Strode, an Asst. Secretary of State under Clinton, now President of Brookings Institute, weighed in on a panel hosted by Brookings.

Its chief import is energy, and its client states will still buy its oil and gas. It's major export partner is the Netherlands! Followed by the Ukraine. Then China for both import and exports...China will no doubt ignore the sanctions and take advantage of the trade opportunities. And how much impact can the West have when the Dutch are its largest partners?..Putin is an old-school believer of the cold war world view who didn't attempt to modernize the economy and understands the steps and strategy for violating borders and invading countries he sees as vital clients...The only question now is how he chooses to play it out. Will he seize the whole country, become an occupying force, or establish a separate nation? ..Whatever options he chooses, there is little the West and the US can do. In fact, no matter what assurances were given by the Ukraine reformers, Putin was coming. He would have generated his own pretext; he commands the troops.","By agreement or aggression, troops in someone else's country is a big deal, especially if there is no war or violence.

It is one-sided and wrong. It does not serve peace, or offer proof, and refuses to hold Putin accountable by the rule of international law...But ideologues blame, have no shame, and advance an agenda pretending they are the good guys in the face of moral and political failure and despotism...Such views support tyranny in the face of reality.","Ten minutes on the internet doing research will quickly establish that to Putin and the Russian leadership sanctions and threats don't make a dime's worth of difference to their objective: control of Ukraine's spider work of energy pipelines, crucial to supplying its leading export, oil and gas, to Europe...Reflect for a moment: quickly name the top three Russia consumer exports. Stumped? Rightly so. Russia's economy is mired in the 1930's, limited domestic production, decaying infra-structure, smoke stack dependent. Its largest trading partner for exports is the Netherlands.

No matter the state of markets for individual investors, the Russian state has come out ahead...Selfies with citizens in the parks not withstanding, to turn back Putin's aggression, sabotage the pipelines right at Russia's borders.

What appears to be thorny, uncomfortable, and wrong works out to become a place of advantage and furthers Russia's policy with little loss...Not citizenship or security but economics and influence is the driving force behind Putin's decision to move Russian troops into Crimea as a staging area, establishing social controls and challenging Ukraine's military, with an eye on Ukraine's oil and gas pipelines as the prize. By proxy (which led to the crisis) or by force (which Russia justifies by the crisis!), along with Russia's pre-crisis offer of 15 billion in aid shows the seriousness of Russia's intent to bring Ukraine into its sphere of influence, and no doubt pushing for changes in pipeline fees...Actually, Russia's biggest exporting partner is the Netherlands. Its major export is crude and refined petroleum which makes up more than 50 of its total export value. With limited retail, tech, and manufacturing sectors, Russia is not likely to be hurt by sanctions. It will take time for Europe to find new supplies. ..Russia will push for a settlement favorable to its objectives.

Miss Ley,,,,"Sometimes it is the least likely politicians that come out of the wood work and gain historical prominence.  Mr. Putin strikes me as one of these persons who is not quite grounded, but one has to take him seriously because there is a risk of having to pay the piper's price...It was that absurd letter with his signature in the paper two summers ago telling us that we should get our act together, eat humble pie and disregard our President.  At first I thought it was a spoof, but then became concerned and wondered what had happened to the Russian Leader...Meanwhile the Ukraine Consulate remains forgotten in the street of New York.  Silence.  Others will have something of more substance to add, but I feel it's going to end badly for him and for others.  This kind of erratic behavior usually does not mysteriously disappear, and it would not surprise me if Russia is tightening its seat-belt for a bumpy ride...America has its troubles, but the President does not send bureaucratic form letters to other countries on their conduct or how to behave, and perhaps it might be wise for Cyprus, smiles and all, to shore up a little closer to China just to be on the safe side...As for the United States never taking a stand against Turkey, anything is possible and Turkey is astute enough to know this, while the rest of such an assumption is just turkey.","Mr. Putin was charming when he helped the First Lady of China keep her shoulders warm with her shawl.  Considerate and gallant, he whipped out a blanket from other his feet, and rose to the occasion when there was a slight chill detected in the air.  True, it was considered slightly awkward at the time, but his gifts to China were graciously received.  I wonder what happened to his Siberian tiger who was last seen swimming to China, and why this magnificent big cat decided it was time to leave off from Russian shores.","Looking at a photo of Putin this weekend last in Milan, surrounded by European leaders, he reminded one of a guy with suicidal tendencies committed to Belleview with a panel of expert psychiatrists and therapists trying to gauge his treatment and his length of stay.  Meanwhile, he is going on about his new Italian shoes, hoping to divert their attention in a self-defeating way.",We have two Super-Powers in the World today:  China and America.  The first is ready to pounce on Putin should he venture too far and press its buttons; the latter is protecting its Allied Nations.  Nothing rarely takes care of itself   and Putin is getting for his performance scrutiny beyond his wildest dreams.,"Mr. Laughlin,.You are not far off.  After we read in the paper in the Summer of 2013 a letter from Putin telling us that we were mediocre people and that it would do us best to ignore our President, quite a majority of commentators thought this was correct and that this Russian leader would be the one to take us in the right direction.  For some reason, the next day there was a change of mind, while a few apologies were extended for this temporary misunderstanding of this state of affairs.","Mr. Arato,.You are correct.  At least where you mention that Putin does not bear the infamy of a name, an anomaly who is not mentioned in polite households.  Standing behind him in the growing shadows, loom thoughts of Stalin...What if Ukraine was invading Russia?  All nations have their cultural and ethical differences, a society divided, a clash between religious ideology, and a legacy of their own...President Obama is waiting but he is no Chamberlain.  It is doubtful that he is going to let this pass, this invasion into Ukraine, if only as a principal which affects the rest of the world, which will affect us down the road in some poor way...40 million people?  Nearly 20 million Russians disappeared during WWII and perhaps we have forgotten if one wants to start counting numbers.  Here I am thinking of a young Russian friend who loves America, whose mother misses her homeland, whose father was a Ukraine diplomat.  Every day I face the Ukraine consulate, and what does that have to do with us?  It is eerily quiet now and silent.  ..Flowers for the Ukraine are my thoughts, while President Obama is taking a stand, and a difficult one, but I would not have it any other way when thinking of the President of America...Perhaps he is our last hope after all; perhaps he is our last President.  As a humanitarian, as an American, I am renewing my pledge of faith in my President, Mr. Obama.","Iryna,.Some of us hear you - there are few original figures in life, and Mr. Putin is not one of them.  Historically, these anomalies resurface like the plague in an even more virulent form...President Obama is not only watching, but may be getting ready to take action.  He is not a man of empty words and it is Mr. Obama who has made an American out of this one, born in New York years before our President, and while America was celebrating the end of the winds of war...Mr. Putin will be stopped at a price; a costly one if need be, and his failure to acknowledge that he has met his match in Mr. Obama will be only one of the causes of his downfall, reminding us that in each man's way lies the shadow of a beast - we are watching possibly a particularly astute and powerful tiger take down a dangerous bear.","President Obama is a far cooler and measured man than Putin who shows the make-up of Marcus Antonius against the Emperor Octavius Augustus, and is all over the place where his dictatorial and defeated ship is about to sail away.  Our leader does not play games, but his knowledge of the world in general is far broader than this Russian leader, and he understands the psychology and character of our People here and overseas.  He is well able of taking, with our allied countries in Europe, measures of such severity that promise to leave Mr. Putin in a state of inner-turmoil that he could never have conceived in his lifetime.  While the wise fools in our midst continue to have a party now, our President is off and running on fleet feet with the deer and the wolves alongside him.","When is it time to start looking sharp if the leader of a country gives sign of crossing the line into another nation, with intent to trouble? ..For this middle-of-the-road American (a place where one risks the chance of being run over), it was the unprecedented letter we received from Mr. Putin in a US nation-wide newspaper last year, pointing out our weakness,  and in a paternal spirit, telling us not to heed our President...When first read as a prank, but when clarified, a sense of foreboding and unease remained.  To mind:  'We haven't heard the last of this. Our President has his work cut out to contain this individual who sounds clever if not too bright, and dangerously living on the edge of reality.  Hoping The People of America back our Leader in his efforts, and those of our Allies, in taking severe measures against this megalomaniac now'...To date, not only has this misguided individual set the Ukraine on fire, but  his own Country as well.  Russia has a long history of such tragedies, and is known for passionate fever in its blood. The People of Russia may decide, with the help of its concerned Allies, to put an 'official' end to this man's search for vain glory, and place a closed seal on the duration of his reign of power, now long expired...The stale parlor game of 'who would you rather have dinner with: Stalin, or the author of Mein Kampf? is now rubble, and we do not want to play a new version again in the annals of Human History.",'Evil' Putin is starting to look slightly crumpled and perplexed and this is no laughing matter.
PT,,,,"The unprecedentedly magnanimous, strategically brilliantly, and fabulously successful Marshall plan was the deliberate inverse of the punitive Treaty of Versailles that most think sowed the seeds for WW2. What a shame we unlearned that lesson when the Soviet Union collapsed, as Nato inexorably crept east until we were up against Russia's borders, and the triumphant forces of capitalism went na-na-nana-na. told ya so! instead of welcoming the once proud and prestigious Russia back into the family of nations. Big mistake -- and Putin is the proof of that ugly pudding.","Who can know for sure at this point whether this is just a ploy or whether Obama's characteristically low key but resolute threats to isolate Russia diplomatically and financially in concert with our allies is starting to paying off?  ..But reading some of these comments, I suspect that even if Putin were to withdraw all Russians troops tomorrow, apologize for having made a terrible mistake, and unconditionally hand Crimea back to Ukraine, some here and elsewhere would STILL manage to see that as evidence of our own President's 'fecklessness' and overall incompetence. The transparency of their prejudicial bias on this and every other issue would be funny if it weren't so concerning that our country is once again so passionately, irrationally, and seemingly irreversibly divided against itself.","Fair enough. Though I wasn't blaming NATO so much as trying to understand Putin's mindset. And what I came up with, but didn't want to belabor the point and be accused of 'Godwinism', was Germany after the humiliations of Versailles, and that delusional Austrian corporal of theirs who threw the entire world into chaos trying to get even.","Problem is, legitimacy, much like beauty, is all too often in the eye of the beholder, hence China's wholly legitimateillegitimate  annexing of Tibet, Turkey's attempted invasionreclaiming of Cyprus, and the US' spending much of the last 200 hundred years poking around in other people's back yards and either overtly or covertly replacing duly elected leaders that we deemed inimical to our interests on 5 of the 7 continents as an often appalled world looked on. ..So one can kinda understand Putin rolling his eyes and going  ! under his breath as we finger-waggingly admonish him for his own 'adventurism', shocked.....

StopPutinsWar,,,,"Have you actually taken the time to study this conflict or do you just feel the need to talk about WWII? Ukraine is just one country with lines bring gas to European markets. Putin recently announced plans to open up a new distribution line through Turkey. If Russia wanted, they could build other lines through Bulgaria. This conflict has nothing to do with controlling gas distribution in Ukraine and everything to do with Putin exerting geopolitical dominance over states formerly in the soviet empire.","Mearsheimer has built his notoriety as a leading Putin apologist in US academia, and has since the beginning of the Ukraine crisis been arguing that it was the West, rather than Putin that was responsible for Putin attacking Ukraine.",Omg Putin recently flew a nuclear armed bomber near British airspace - this proves he will destroy the world if we don't give him whatever he wants. He's a bare-chested fighter who knows martial arts for gosh sakes!,"People keep making references to Russia's nuclear capabilities as if the West was conemplating arming Ukraine with ICBMs - that's nonsense. Russia is not facing invasion - Ukraine is. It's just an hysteric reference that is thrown out there to cloud the discussion here which is simply about providing Ukraine defensive technology to help that state gain leverage in peace negotiations. The West is not going to war against Russia, and Putin is not on the verge of unleashing the Apocalypse.",Putin is not some god that must be appeased by sacrificing whatever weak nation he chooses to devour. ..He is simply more determined to push his agenda than so far anyone has been willing to challenge. It's high time for the European leadership to rise to the occasion and put a stop to Putin's expansionist militarism. ..So far the sanctions that the West has imposed have done next to nothing to contain Putin's aggression. It's time to give the Ukrainians th defensive military capabilities they need to put a stop to the separatists' military offensive and force them back the bargaining table.,The U.S. is not at war with Russia - Russia is at war with Ukraine - simply because the Putin regime wants it so. ..Ukraine has a right to defend itself with defensive battlefield military technology that can help deter the current Russian offensive.,,,,
serban,,,,"Russian aggression against Ukraine is deplorable but should not be a surprise to anyone. For most of its history Ukraine has (at least the Eastern portion) been part of the Russian empire and its recent independence is from the Russian point of view an aberration. Putin sees much more at stake in the Ukraine than the rest of Europe so will not relent his grip since he knows the West will never consider paying a  heavy price to secure Ukraine's borders. The Ukrainian weakness is compounded by rampant corruption, honesty is no more common in the Ukraine government as it is in Putin's government.",A meeting with Putin is only a bad idea if you believe Obama will easily give in to any proposal that strengthens Russia at the expense of the US. After 7 years of dealing with Republicans I think he is more than prepared to deal with Putin.,"Conflicts between the West and Russia will continue until more of an effort is made to bring Russia into the European fold. That requires both Russia and the rest of Europe see that it is to their mutual advantage to get Russia into NATO.and eventually part of the E.U. Obviously, as long as Russia is ruled by the likes of Putin and his clique that can only be a pipe dream. But Putin will not be there forever and the ground work for a post-Putin world needs to start now.",The number of comments supporting Russian separatists in Ukraine is surprising.  What do they know that Western Ukrainians don't and how do they know it? All I can see from this distance is that those speaking Ukrainian would like to be closer to the EU and those speaking Russian closer to Russia. Ukraine population is split and without objective observers on the ground supervising free elections we have no way of knowing what the majority wants. If the majority in Eastern Ukraine wants to be part of Russia under Putin by all means let them. It is clear that the majority in Western Ukraine do not and should be allowed  to develop closer ties with the EU.,"Unfortunately economic sanctions will not deter Putin, their effect is too slow to affect conditions on the ground. Military action by the West is off the table, neither the US nor Europe can afford a hot war with Russia and Putin is counting on that. Whatever happens next the only option open to the West is a long term strategy that will have a deep impact on the Russian economy, like divesting from any dependence on Russia for energy and cutting all business contacts as long as Putin remains in power.  This will take years but the cost to Russia may eventually reverse its grab of Ukranian territory. A new cold war may be in the works, but Russia is much weaker and vulnerable than the Soviet Union was, so the new cold war will not last as the last one.","A leopard cannot change its spots and it is wishful thinking to believe that Putin can change his mode of operations. His power comes from distributing goodies to a tight clique of friends, taking the candy away from those who cross him and playing on Russian resentment of their loss of empire. He will try to weasel out of the sanctions by lying and acting as the victim of Western aggression. The well-being of most Russians is the least of his concerns, only that of his pals.",Putin's mendacity surpasses the mendacity displayed by GOP politicians but not the shamelessness. Both lie while maintaining a perfectly straight face.,"A little bit of fairly recent history can shine light on why Russians enthusiastically support Putin's actions in Ukraine.  When the USSR collapsed.it was Kravchuk, the governor of Ukraine at the time, that single handedly doomed a proposed Commonwealth between former USSR republics as replacement to the USSR by refusing to sign it. His motivation was an unwillingness to cede any power to a center. Kruvchak was an old apparatchik, nothing democratic about him, but this action was very popular in Ukraine and even regions with large Russian populations were happy to go along with it. Yeltsin basically wanted the USSR gone  to remove Gorbachev from all levels of power and replace it with a Commonwealth. With Ukraine gone the other Republics saw no incentive to join an entity that would be dominated by Russia. Most Russians believe Ukraine must be linked to Russia, that it should be just another province of the Russian federation..An independent Ukraine is seen as an aberration. Most Ukrainians on the other hand no longer want go back to being part of the Russian empire, thus their wish to join the rest of Europe. Whether the West encourages or not that aspiration has little to do wit the ongoing conflict.",Russian aid is obviously a propaganda stunt by Putin but there is no need to react with any panic. It should be allowed to get to its destination unimpeded.while insisting that there be neutral observers that can ascertain no weapons are being delivered to the separatists. As long as Putin can claim he is helping his fellow Russians without using military force it is all for the good.,"This is one of the few sensible columns I have read from Mr. Douthat. Putin's moves are a display of weakness, not strength. It is easy to wreck havoc, much more difficult to build something permanent.  Putin's tactics are similar to guerilla tactics that inflict irritating wounds with no significant gains in the long run. Contrast Russia with China. China has scrupulously avoided military conflicts, concentrated on economic growth without giving any control to outside investors and is investing large sums in Africa to ensure access to the commodities it needs. China has many problems but it is now an economic powerhouse, far more influential than Russia on the world stage. Putin's policies have no chance of ever raising Russia to the same level. Russia would be much better off if it allied itself with the West and stopped trying to behave as if it was an expanding empire. What possible benefit is there for ordinary Russians to have Assad in power in Syria?"
HRM911,,,,"If anyone thinks that Putin is backing off, there is a bridge to Brooklyn I'm sure someone will sell you. At this point does anyone think he is going to give back Crimea. He has accomplished everything he wants. Crimea belongs to Russia and he has shown everyone that he can move 70,000   battle ready troupes to the Ukraine boarder at any time and if he wants to, into the Ukraine.  Why would he want to get into the middle of that mess? He can wait until they get tired of killing each other and deal with the winner. They owe Russia a huge amount of money for the energy bought but never paid for. He know that sooner or later the administration will decide to send Kiev all sorts of money in a futile attempt to have some influence.  Russia will get paid, Putin's soldiers will be back at home playing with their children, and the U.S. tax payer will foot the bill.","Putin knows exactly what he is doing. Our White Hose doesn't have a clue. We tell a handful of Russians they can't  have a visa to vacation in Miami this year and their Prime  Minister  says the idea must have been thought up by some prankster. Obama still backs Morse and the Muslin Brotherhood when over a million protesters in the streets of Cairo wanted them out of power. At the same time he backs the protesters in the Ukraine who chased their leader out.  The he declares the will of the people in Crimea  to go back to Russia where they originally belonged, Illegal.  France is  on the sideline eating quiche because the have a huge deal they sold to Russia. The Germans may complain but they learned their lesson  over seventy years ago. England has enough on their hands  because Scotland is thinking of splitting off. Canada has Ottawa threatening to split.   Italy is worried because Venus is talking about leaving them. In the meantime The CIA and NSA are calling the White House asking them if they forgot it is the Russians who make the rockets to send all of our spy satellites up. The White House declares it may stop visas for a few more Russians which  is responded by Putin moving 60,000  troupes to the Ukrainian border. Then our  president sends his ultimate threat, Joe Biden to deal with Putin. Scary isn't it.  I think we all might have been safer if he just gone back to Hawaii and vacationed for a few weeks.","Putin has shown he has little or no concern for Obama or Kerry. About the only thing that Obama cost Putin with the previous actions was a seat in the gang of eight. Putin shrugged it off. They have no real power anyway and spend most of their time toasting each other.  In the meantime France is saying they have no intention to cancel their huge contracts with Russia. Putin announced he will be building ten new nuclear facilities in Iran instead of two as well as selling them advanced ground to air weapons. Egypt who Obama tuned his back on in favor of the Muslin Brotherhood, is now setting up joint military exercises with Russia  and ignored Kerry comments about releasing the journalist recently arrested. Russia and China have signed a huge and multi-year  energy contract.  In the meantime Putin has sent ships and airplanes to Venezuela and Cuba and bombers to about fifty miles from California. As the article indicates the E.U is not supportive if any more sanctions. In any case, why would Putin want the Ukraine? He has the sea access with Crimea. The Ukraine is hugely backed up on their payments to Russia for energy.  If Putin just stirs up trouble,  he knows that sooner or later Obama will start the cash flow  to the Ukraine and Russia will get paid.  Putin doesn't want to take on a very poor country with huge debt.  He is fine with the U.S. footing the bill.","W are so  far behind Russia and Putin. Washington denies a few visas, seizes assets of a few Russian companies, asks the E.U. to not do business with Russia, and bands Putin from the group of 8 who don't do much but toast each other.  In the meantime France is going ahead with over a billion dollars in ships they are building for Russia, no one was turned off the the Russian energy spigot, etc. etc. etc.  Russia still has 40,000 troupes in Crimea ready to walk straight into the Ukraine any time Putin  wants. In an attempt to reassure the E.U.,  Obama answer is to send 150 soldiers to the area. Iran who was coached by Putin on how to act around Obama and succeeded  in getting some sanction easing, is right back to where their nuclear  intentions were before they smiled and talked nicely to him. Syria is a mess, Egypt is purging itself of the Muslin Brotherhood who Obama backs, The Ukraine is in turmoil. The Palestinians, who both Obama and Kerry have backed  in their talks with Israel, are  in a new pack with Hamas..Each step we have taken has ended in us being ineffective.   In the meantime Putin now controls Crimea and all the assets and advantages listed in the article.  To add to our problems more countries like Egypt are tuning to Putin for stability. It is scary and there is no hope in sight that things will get better.","W are so  far behind Russia and Putin.

Our president turns his back on the Egyptian leadership who are now looking to Russia for equipment and such things as helicopters which Obama refused to sell them. He is still backing the Muslin Brotherhood.  The Egyptians respond by sentencing over 500 MBs to death and looking for more. The Saudis are furious because they hate the MB. He treats Israel like a second class ally of no importance. He hasn't figured out whether to bomb the Syrian army or the rebels who are laced with Al Qaeda. He then bands a few Russians from getting visas because the Russians are in Crimea and the people there want to rejoin Russia who they were taken from in the past. The Russians say that must have been thought up by a bunch of pranksters. Along the way Obama sends Kerry and Biden over who are no match for Putin who promptly moves 60,000 troupes to the Ukraine boarder. In the meantime Putin is sending ships and planes to Venezuela.  Now he wants Russia to be banned from the Eight which Putin could care less about. Are you scared  yet?","Wars kill people. The whole story is not out here. Questions about being diverted to the area and told to fly lower will need answered.  In an insurgency  war, there are no rules of engagement and the people running around with missiles  are mostly trained on how to pull the trigger. But this  type of tragedy happens is just waiting to happen. Before Obama get too self righteous, someone should remind him of flight 655 which was shot down by our navy which does have rules of engagement and extensive training. Trying to pin it on Putin is just trying to make those lost into tools to pummel Putin with. It won't work. Find the truth and let it speak for itself.  Don't try to use their deaths in apolitical way. Send honest people to help find out what happened and then let everyone know. We know what happen to flight 655. We ought to know what happened with flight 370","Does anyone really think Putin is going to pull his troupes out and give Crimea back to whoever is in charge at the time in the Ukraine? The charts in the article indicate the answer to that. Who are we to freeze assets of Russian companies? Putin has already said he will just not make any more payments on loans to Russia. Kerry blast Russia  in a speech and Putin promptly sends his planes into Ukraine airspace. He is already sending planes and ships  to Cuba and Venezuela That is something he hasn't done since before the Bush presidency. He knows that in the end Europe will fold. They are too tied economically to Russia We have no treaty with the Ukraine and neither they nor Putin are shooting a BB gun at us. Obama is left to calling the Russians names, a sign of weakness. We have spiraled down in respect for our leadership. He pushes China and they increase their air defense zone.. He turned his back on Israel and the Palestinians make a pack with Hamas. He acts like Egypt still belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood.  The government promptly condemns hundreds of them to death. Syria is a disaster. They  still killing each other and the rebels who he backed are in such close alliance with Al-Qaeda that  they are asking to establish  bases. This stuff is getting scarier every day.","Has he cancelled the contract to build the rockets that send our  satellites including the spy satellites, into space? Has  he convinced the French to give up the 450 million contract they had with the Russians? Does he really think that  anyone in Europe is going to stop buying Russian energy? And since he has refused to sell Egypt helicopters, they won't turn to Russia. Doe he think Iran won't have Russia to continue to build nuclear plants and they will cancel the advanced ground to air weapons Russia has agreed to sell them? It is too late to go back to post world war strategies. Not only that but we had Truman and he had a history of dropping two of the big one on an enemy.  Obama sent 150 soldiers to reassure Europe while Russia has 60,000 or more on the Ukraine boarder.  We have hsd one international event after another where our diplomacy looks flawed. When Putin is put in the mix, we look like armatures.  This is getting scary.","Putin is going to do exactly what he wants. Just like he did in Syria when Kerry made an off the cuff comment.  Europe promises some money but it is based on something they want from the IMF. Otherwise they know that they do about 450 billion  in trade with Russia part of which is oil and they don't want that messed up. Even Japan has told us they don't want to stir up trouble with Russia.  What does Putin really care about joint military exercises being cancelled. He just fires off a new type of rocket.  As for as cutting off funds, he say so what, he just won't pay the loans back. We are indeed a paper tiger in debt to just about everyone. We have had one international failure after another and no one seems to really  care what we say anymore.  It is scary. It is like no one here has a clue."
loveman0,,,,mr. putin can take heart that the communist party is lined up behind him and that russia can return to the worker's paradise days of the old soviet union. maybe even sing the old communist nationalist songs while forming a secret service to watch people that may entertain other thoughts.,"two things here:  apparently Mr. Putin's Russia can't be trusted even after they sign agreements, and, given the current political climate, offering missile defense systems to Iran can only be seen as encouragement to them to have nuclear weapons...Where are all the weapons coming from in the Mideast?  Who in the East and West are supplying these?  There also needs to be a Treaty to limit and monitor access of these weapons.","maybe we could tie Putin's shoelaces together while he's not looking?..the move in Crimea was a military one to protect russian military assets there.  a response would be to immediately deny russia bases in the mediterrean, namely syria.  aid for assad, including to order or look the other way when he used chemical weapons, is for that purpose.  mr Putin is fighting a rearguard action to take back as much of the old soviet empire as he can. This includes an active spy service, the KGB that ruled a supposedly workers unite communist soviet union,  which in reality was a continuation of the palace guard of Peter the Great ruling russia.  i suspect the shootings in Kiev were ordered from russia...Putin's propaganda piece about russia as a fledgling democracy printed in the times:  all propaganda.  we just saw what he considers a fair election--armed soldiers looking over the heads of the voters.  in russia he canceled elections for governors of the provinces; so much for listening to the will of the people to govern themselves...russia has seized the assets of BP and Royal Dutch when it pleased them.  What can Exxon be thinking? Or is it our oil state politicians willing to sacrifice everything for oil?..of course tying his shoe laces together would have to be done in secret (times editor, please print this part upside down), and on an important world stage--imagine the embarrassment.  how: pretty female prime minister is making speech; our guy sneaks up behnd and while...",,,,,,,
EJZimmerman,,,,"The two leaders are entirely different, and have entirely different goals.  Putin wants to conquer his neighbor and hold Europe hostage to fuel supplies; Obama wants to prevent importation of jihad (term suggests this is about religion-NOT) to other countries, while trying to help the innocent victims of jihadists.  There is nothing similar between Iraq and Ukraine, and it is wrong to suggest that Putin is driven by any moral considerations.","As long as family members get their loved ones back, I don't think the black boxes will shed any additional light on this matter.  We know who did it and how.  Now, a tough decision must be made about how to deal with the cowardly perpetrators.  No sanctions can be too harsh for Mr. Putin and his gleeful supporters.","Ridiculous!  Putin is a fearless adventurer who can't accept that the Soviet Union is gone.  He will never be a trusted friend to anyone in NATO.  Only to countries like North Korea, Syria, Iran, Cuba, China, and maybe ambitious leaders in Africa.  Putin is nothing but a powerful thug.",,,,,,,
Jeff,,,,"Just like Saddam Hussein growing a beard (See Sunday's Times) was a fundamental misread of the nuances of western culture, every time I read about Putin's actions all i can think is that he really doesn't understand us. The USA to him appears weak as opposed to measured, but when and if we decide to act there will be no hesitation. HIs actions are creating a united front against him, when he could have had almost anything he wanted for Russia if he had behaved differently.  He doesn't get it and that is what makes him dangerous.","Putin's myth of Western encirclement has some basis. NATO countries are now up against the Russian border in Eastern Europe. Russia has known two conditions throughout its history: empire and subjugation. This is deeply ingrained in the Russian psyche. It should not come as a surprise that the middle road, the road of cooperation and national community is anathema to Russia. Better to create a Eurasian customs union that Russia may dominate than to join the EU and be subjugated by the Germans and the French, who invaded Russia in the 19th and 20th centuries...As a result, Cohen is right. The Russians do not think that the rules apply to them. Playing by the rules is cooperation which, because it is not domination, is submission...This is a bad scenario for peace. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, thwarting Georgia's NATO desires, and invaded Ukraine in 2013, thwarting Ukraine's EU and NATO desires. Because of the frozen conflicts left in both countries, neither will be NATO candidates...What is the US to do? Soft power -- education and culture that convert a country's people to international civil norms -- won't work because Russia has shut that down. Civil society is all but banished east of Poland. Hard power, considering the size of the nations on Russia's borders, will require direct military confrontation. Arming Ukraine, one of the larger of Russia's neighbors, will not end the conflict there. Ukraine still struggles with corruption and a dysfunctional government.","It is no accident that there are many more intercepts of Russian military aircraft by western countries as Russia probes our resolve. Putin believe that the west has no backbone, that we are not willing to suffer for our point of view. He is very willing to make ordinary Russian people suffer, regardless of their actual point of view.  Putin's concern is certainly a desire to restore Russia's standing and a sense of nationalism, but he is also concerned about maintaining his personal grip on power as the head of a vast criminal empire. Criminals don't and never will give up power voluntarily for the alternative for them once they are out of power is bleak. If Russia is not strongly confronted now expect a continuing series of showdowns and brinksmanship. From Putin's standpoint he has no alternative and he views his adversaries as weak.","Arming the Ukrainian military would be a huge mistake. Since this war began, thousands of military-age Ukrainian men have poured into Russia, not because they approve of Putin but because they fear being drafted and then slaughtered by Russian-equipped rebels. The problem is so bad that the Ukrainian government is now enlisting men up to age 60 to fight. For Obama to consider providing arms to such a dysfunctional military is akin to arming the rebels, as they'll ultimately obtain and use the weapons against the Ukraine and then blame the West for the ensuing chaos. Moreover, Putin would ultimately feel emboldened. Since Russia really doesn't view NATO as a serious military threat, but rather a symbol of Western imperialism, what's needed are new and sweeping economic sanctions that require Putin to seek out foreign aid to maintain his economy (and temporal popularity). He'd most likely reach out to China, which would then be confronted with the tough choice of tacitly supporting Putin's war for Ukraine.","Well, Putin is corrupt but doesn't hold a candle to Hitler and Stalin.","After reading the comments here I fear for the safety of the country. Do you realize what this means? Russia bought our government. And the person that they bought wants to be the President. And that does not seem to alarm anyone at all! You got to be kidding me. Putin is looking to corner the main ingredient in making nuclear bombs. And here we discuss if the person that has helped facilitate this should be elected President. Ever heard of the word Treason?. Come on people I know you tend to look the other way when any Democrat is caught doing anything wrong, but this is really going to far.","To put it more simply, Vladimir Putin is an autocrat. And he sees nothing wrong with Bashar al-Assad being the same thing. He has sent Russian bombers and artillery into Syria because he thinks that Assad is losing the battle. He is genuinely concerned about Muslim extremist terrorism. It is doubtful he'll have any more success with an air campaign in Syria than America and its allies have.","Its hard to believe that the trucks are full of humanitarian supplies when the Russians are lying about their cooperation with the Red Cross.  Putin claims that the supplies will be inspected by the Red Cross when they arrive at the border. The Red Cross has no reason to lie when it says that no such arrangements have been made yet. ..Putin want the Ukraine as part of Russia.  Never forget how Russia absorbed Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia or how  Hitler absorbed Austria and Poland.  ..The Ukraine and the rest of the world has every reason to suspect that Putin is up to no good with this truck convoy","Douthat doesn't get it. Putin's aims and Russian aims are largely congruent. Russia continues to see itself as the Third Rome, the conservator of Christianity and Christian morality. It sees Europe and the United States as decadent members of the neighborhood. It sees its immediate neighbors as both at risk for falling into Western decadence and as its lost children, brothers, and cousins...Russia is also like a jealous and controlling ex-husband. It cannot abide Georgia, Ukraine, or Kyrgyzstan or any of the other former Russian territories (and later Soviet republics) dating NATO...It's adventurism in Georgia in 1992 and in 2008, and in Ukraine in 2014 is not adventurism from its perspective, but necessary to its sovereignty. These adventures have come at little or no cost and, until the cost is significant, Russia will continue to use force and subterfuge to subdue and absorb its neighbors...What is the EU and USA to do? Do what we have always done. With their consent, place tripwires in those countries who are independent and democratic. Want to invade Georgia? Trip over the 17 Infantry.","On 25 February Der Spiegel published an analysis by Uwe Klussmann that the Russian speaking people in eastern Ukraine need protection from Kiev, so Putin should be invited in to provide protection...Sounds like Russian propaganda in the German press to me."

The puppet regime was Yanukovich who was ready to sign with the EU, until Puppet Master Putin summoned him to Russia for a conversation.  Upon return the EU deal was declared dead and Yanukovich was going to have Ukraine join the Russian customs union.  That is a puppet...Kyiv is trying to re-take land captured by the pro-Russian terrorists who are hiding within the population on purpose, to specifically cause civilian casualties and then disappear.  Mobil mortars, RPGs, and light artillary make it easy to shoot from civilian areas.  If the Ukrainian Army did not try to weed the pro-Russian insurrgents out of the cities, then you have the situation in Crimea, where Russia just walked in and took over because no one wanted to have civilian casulaties.","If Russia and Putin belive a federalized system is better, then why don't they change the Constitution of the Russian Federation to such a structure. Currently Russia is more centralized then Ukraine, because the regional Governors are appointed by Putin and they appoint all the members of the Upper House of the Russian Parliment.

Their influence is probably far greater than that of Chancellor Merkel, the EU, NATO and the west combined. I am not making any excuses for what Putin is doing. But, the west was generally supportive of the actions in western Ukraine that precipitated this crisis. Finally, the Chancellor's invocation  of Ukraine's territorial integrity is inconsistent with the history and background of that country, and Europe in general. Would she have said the same re: the former USSR or Yugoslavia or post-communist Czechoslovakia?","To Spudchapp:..No doubt Putin's approach is dangerous for Russia, primarily, and the Russian people probably know that.

Tony Wicher,,,,"For the entire first Obama administration, and well into the second, the Obama foreign policy continued that of the Bush administration. This was the neocon policy of world domination sometimes called the Wolfowitz Doctrine as expressed in the Project for a New American Century. This doctrine is that there must arise no power anywhere in the world capable of thwarting the will of the last superpower, and that any power that defies our will must be destabilized and overthrown.  This doctrine was applied to Iraq under Bush, and then to Libya and Syria under Obama.  The result has been the destruction of three functioning states, and the arise of ISIS out of the resulting chaos. What is worse is that our so-called war against ISIS has been completely phony. We have been continuing the neocon policy by allowing our allies Saudi Arabia and Turkey to finance and supply ISIS as an instrument to overthrow Assad. This policy has finally caused Putin to step in to protect Russia's ally Syria and to declare a real war against ISIS.  This gives Obama the perfect opportunity to reverse the neocon policies of the last six years. If the U.S. and Russia can form a good working relationship at the U.N. this week, there is no international problem that cannot be solved.","Putin cannot allow the U.S. installed Kiev regime remain in power. It's not only Crimea, there is also Odessa, where my mother was born. All the years I was growing up, she told me she was born in Russia. The word Ukraine was not even mentioned. Putin cannot allow the residents of Odessa to be persecuted by the anti-Russian, illegitimate puppet regime in Kiev. He will have to go into Kiev and kick them out. What will the U.S.do then? There is no military option, unless you consider thermonuclear war an option. I hope we're not that crazy.","Wrong. The ceasefire agreed to did not include Debaltsevo. Putin wanted it to, but that would have meant the Poroshenko would have had to tell the troops in the Debaltsevo pocket to surrender. They would have been sent home unharmed. It was Poroshenko's decision not to do this. and he is therefore responsible for sacrificing the lives of his troops.","When the U.S. says the international community it means it means the Anglo-European Empire, which is the same as the pre-World War 2 British empire plus Western Europe and the U.S. It does not include Russia, China, India, Iran, Syria, Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia and more than half of the world's population.  This Anglo-European Empire, which is the modern extension of the old British Empire seeks world hegemony as the British Empire did. After a twenty-year campaign of subversion it tried to annex the Ukraine by engineering a coup by right-wing ultranationalist anti-Russian anti-Semitic thugs.  They cannot possibly be allowed to remain in power. Putin will have to go into Kiev to kick them out. What we have to do in this country is not punish Russia for resisting Anglo-American aggression but to cease acting like an empire, impeach or otherwise get rid of those who are carrying out this policy and return to being a peaceful constitutional republic.","Washington's lies echoed by the presstitute media that serves Washington are destroying Washington's credibility and that of the Western media among Europeans, especially Germans who understand that the threat to peace comes from across the Atlantic, not from east of the Oder River...The success or failure of Vladimir Putin's bet that reasonable diplomacy and unprovocative behavior on Russia's part will contrast favorably with the shrill provocations by Washington depends upon whether European politicians respond to their own citizens or continue in their role as lackeys of Anglo-American imperialism.","Can an election run by a U.S. installed putsch regime chock full of Bandera fascists have any credibility? Only in the eyes of the State Department is this anything but a charade. Putin said he respects the will of the people of Ukraine, not the outcome of this farce. What he did say was that we will watch what will happen. I'm watching right along with him. He is leaving it to the Ukrainian people to oust this regime. It's probably the right strategic choice, but many will die in the process. I feel sorry for the people.","The pressure on Putin is mostly coming from U.S. propaganda organs such as this one.

Many people, including myself, believe Putin on this. Furthermore, many of us believe that the U.S. is 100 responsible for the mess that Ukraine has become. I do not believe that the NYT has ever reported on the NulandPyatt phone conversation. Nor has the NYT ever reported on a phone conversation between Urmas Paet and the EU's Catherine Ashton. This is very incriminating stuff--for the U.S. and the Maidan protesters, that is. The NYT is just another propaganda arm for the U.S. government, which may be understandable since their profits and existence would be at risk if they told the truth...I suspect that Russia is willing to go to very great lengths militarily to avoid the slow agonizing death through vivisection that the U.S. has in mind for her. U.S. and EU needs to end subsidies and all support for the illegitimate government now in place in Ukraine. And the U.S. needs to top the usual chest-thumping over this. Russia is threatening no one.",,,,,,,,

Bad aim?.... Mistaken identity?...Coincidence???.Good luck that those Russian air-strikes didn't take out the fleet Russian fleet in Tartus as well....At this point, one must ask if there is still hope for any cooperation between the U.S and Russia in defending Syria against the ISIS, without entering into another World War..The stakes are very high. The world is watching.","No one with any familiarity of the Cold War mentality should be surprised by the tactics of Mr. Putin, as he is playing close to the script. His intentions with the Ukraine have been on the table ever since it broke away as an independent republic, and his militaristic plans for the rest of the Baltic are evident by the repeated invasion of Russian jets flying into foreign air space..But all of this somehow pales by the recent decision to supply Iran with Russian armaments. Clearly Mr. Putin is spoiling for a fight, and it is one that will involve the rest of the world if he gets his wish.","Well. Big Surprise. Mr. Putin follows his own agenda in Syria.

The world is watching.","Mr. Putin has a very mixed track-record when it comes to saying one thing, and.then doing something else. It is perhaps best for the world community to keep an eye and ear open and if needs be, to carry a big stick, especially because all attempts at diplomacy haven't worked thus far.","Entering into talks with Mr. Putin may very well be the first chance to finally address the elephant in the room that is Syria. Regardless of his past, present, or future designs on the region, it has got to be clear that the common enemy here is ISIS, and the spread of fundamentalist Islam. Almost all of Syria's entire population has fled after enduring years of missiles, bombs, and beheadings, What further proof is needed?  Europe is sagging under the weight of having to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees, who may or may not integrate easily into Western society, or find acceptance there, which could easily set off the next phase of social unrest..The United States and Russia would be well advised to come to terms with the problems they face with each other for the common good of Syria, and quite possibly the rest of the world.","Not a good sign. Russian troops on the ground. Russian planes flying sorties into Turkish airspace. It appears as though we are inching ever closer to proxy war in Syria with this recent Russian escalation. At this point, the U.S. just might want to ask itself if a Syria with Assad is as frightening as one without. Undoubtedly, Mr. Putin has very definite goals in mind, but he's playing with fire if he wants to assert his will over Mr. Edogan, who has an equally strong will as well.","What's the big problem about understanding Mr. Putin's motives in Syria, when they literally speak for themselves? If Mr. Putin's intentions were truly about fighting ISIS, there would be no need for Russian bombers to hit sites known to be populated by the Syrian Free Army and other opponents of Mr. Assad..At this point, how and why this mess in Syria got started is a moot point because there's no way to turn back the hands of time. And allocating the blame is equally futile, because it only obfuscates the real problem; which is how to stop the march of ISIS in the region and end this war which has dislocated over half of Syria's population.","Did anybody ever seriously think that Mr. Putin's involvement in Syria would be anything less than dishonorable? Of course, it would have been great had he lived up to his pledge to help stem ISIS activities. But of course, his long-standing support of Mr. Assad would have prevented that..So instead, what we have here is a prime example of political opportunism. Mr. Putin has to keep face at home in Russia, and what better way to do that than to beat the drum of nationalism with a show of military might?.Potential for conflict with the U.S?--A good probability..Potential for further escalation?--An even greater probability..Solution to the problem?-- Nothing viable in the foreseeable future..Only the outcome is certain, and it involves more death and destruction.","Of course it's  not a crisis for Mr. Putin and his well-heeled associates who have scrupulously undermined Russia's economy to their own advantage for ages. And of course, those pesky sanctions are all undeserved, and a product of the West trying to undermine the Bear and of course, it's only temporary....","This is something that should not be considered surprising. Mr. Putin has continually  proven himself a master at changing the rules of the game to suit his own purposes. And with Mr.  Erdogan, he has found the perfect playmate to both criticize the West, and foil the fuel exchange to those countries no longer interested in conforming to his will..Inarguably, Mr. Putin and his favored circle of elites will continue to remain oblivious to the pinch of any hardships brought on by the enforced sanctions. In fact, they might even be so inclined as to go shopping for another inter-continental missile, or two..."
Michael O'Neill,,,,If your view is that Nato provoked Putin I would guess that you also think a private security sign on your front lawn just provokes your next door neighbor into thinking about burglary.,"Our failure to properly price the cost of burning hydrocarbons for energy has virtually unlimited bad consequences...Whether it is Venezuela, Russia or that mess in the Middle East we exalt tin pot potentates and encourage international oligarchs...We raise the oceans, upset the climate, choke our cities and poor our treasure and our youth into needless wars and short lived capital of dubious value...For those who think Putin is partially hamstrung by American oil companies fracking for oil and gas, just imagine what building an economy based on renewable solar, wind, wave, geothermal and low head hydro would do to all these egomaniacal oil barons.",How soon we forget. This all started with the run up to the Russian Winter Olympics (Shades of Munich). With Fox and Friends touting Putin as a World Leader head-and-shoulders above that wimp Obama...Everyone has been so enamored of his bold approach and firm commitment. But we fail to see that he is just first among many. Chief Thug of a gang of Thugs...Just as in the 1930s we should remember that each time a group of thugs is given a pass and allowed to annex this place or extend influence in that direction it just emboldens them...Hitler was well loved by elements of the aristocracy in France and Britain in the middle thirties as well. Everyone cheers when a dashing thug makes a bold move against someone you do not like. But then as now we should remember that the thug doesn't really care if you like him or not. He just wants what he wants and will hurt anyone who gets in his way.,"This one battle, standing out in the sea of yet another 'cease fire' should bring home the reality that this is in fact a war of statist aggression. It is most unlikely that the West can weave a viable excuse to commit adequate resources to balance the Russian incursion. Thus the end must be the severing of Ukraine into a Russian puppet state and a Euro Zone client state. How many more young men must die before Mr. Poroshenko will admit that Putin is going to remain a successful bully?","As the comments indicate this is a confusing issue with no clear answer on either side. When sanctions to stem the covert support of banditry are considered imperialist in nature we have obviously become hypersensitive to the American governments tendency to be combative and ugly on the world stage. Sanctions are not tanks, not even close...The writers, from Rand, are showing their roots, on the other hand. While most NYT readers, as shown by these comments, fear the inevitable escalation that leads from sanctions to actual military maneuvers and finally to a return of the Cold War, the writers from Rand embrace the possibility. Here is a chance to win big with the drop in the price of oil magnifying the effect of sanctions...There are no better angels here. Putin has been pushing his advantages to the point of breaking international law and even upending the logic of his own position. Obama has been harder on Putin then necessary to achieve America's goals, probably because of internal American politics...I do not believe the sanctions were ever meant to destroy or even substantially damage the Russian economy. They were meant to put the oligarchs and Putin under duress, to make them slightly uncomfortable, to encourage them to work with Ukraine and Europe to end this escalating unrest...Now that the oil glut and subsequent drop in price is swamping the effect of sanctions it is time to dial it back. Not up.","In games and in life you should never expect your opponent to just give up and let you win. For Putin and for Russia this is a competition and one they desire to win. The European Union should have known better then to think that there was really a chance for collaboration, cooperation and mutual respect...The economic well being of the Russian people is only important in the sense that it is necessary to keep the people under political control. The wealth of the oligarchs is only important as a precursor to those same oligarchs having the power to go head to head with the business oligarchs of the west...Of course Putin is courting the leaders of like minds around the world. Men of a tyrannical bent. Men who are also playing the game of thrones.",The belief that there is something a 'stronger' president could do to bring Putin in line is the basic insanity of the right. It is similar to the young person who believes that a better parent could control an unruly screaming child by some sort of 'think method'...This is all nonsense...Which explains why Republican presidents so often lose their cool and start a war...Pathetic.,,,
VMG,,,,So we are now to believe that Putin somehow has changed his ways and wants a peaceful resolution in the Ukraine without taking more territory and this in the same week he secretly put restrictions on free speak on the internet? If it walks like a duck..,"NATO was created for just such a scenario that is developing now with Russia and will be a true test of that organization. The US doesn't have to be the lead in all world conflicts and as crazy as Putin seems, Russia has gone to war for lessor reasons. We need NATO to do what it was designed to do and that is to protect Europe from Soviet (Russian) agreesion. Yes the US is a part of NATO, but that doesn't mean we have to represent all of NATO.","Economic sanctions against 21 people, really? This is supposed to be a deterring response to a leader of a country thats just annexed a sovereign state? Economic sanctions can work if applied effectively. This piece meal approach is laughable. If the EU and US cannot get put tough sanctions in place immediately it only invites Putin to take more, then we will have to make a decision on whether we get involved militarily or stand by and watch. Time is slipping away. A tough response is need now. It doesnt have to be a military response, but if its not meaningful and swift, military action may be the only choice in the future and it will be a very messy choice.","What a farce, Snowden is questioning Putin about surveillance of the Russian citizens. Is he that young or naive that he knows nothing of the RussianSoviet history? Putin will do what he wants. The Federation Council (Politburo) will do what Putin wants them to do. The excuses for going into the Ukrane are the same type of reasoning that Hitler used when occupying Austria. Hitler didnt stop there and if Putin does not see a united front against the occupation of the Ukraine he wont stop there either.","Let Russia go into Syria. Apparently Putin has a short memory of the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. The Russian economy is in shambles so let him spent his money on propping up Assad and fighting ISIS and maybe when his money and Goodwill is spent we will go in and finish off a weakened ISIS..If Putin thinks that this gesture is going to win the Russian a place in the hearts of the Iraqis, Iranians or anyone else in the Middle East he will be sadly mistaken.",There is only one way that Putin will back away from the Ukrainian invasion and thats defeat on the battle field either by direct combat or by making it too costly for the invasion to go on. Putin has shown that he doesnt care about what hardships that sanctions may impose on the Russian people and so far the Russian population seems to be backing him...The US and NATO nations need to assist Ukraine in any way possible to help militarily defeat Russia and the Russian supporters and that appears to be the only way to bring Russia to the negotiation table.,"Its time the US stops posturing and threatening Putin or we will blunder into another conflict that the US public doesnt have the stomach or finances to fight. Its time Obama stops with the threats and applies firm, damaging, economic sanctions. Verbal attacks against Putin are fruitless, they only embolden him. Economic sanctions can happen quietly and be more effective than threats or military exercises.","Putin has painted himself into a corner and for a man that rides shirtless for the cameras he's not going to back down from threats whether they be economic or military. Not publically anyway. Thats not to say that economic sanction will not work. Putin may not listen to outside influences, but he will listen to internal pressure. His ego wont allow him to be vilified by the Russian people so the pressure must come from within. This can only be accomplished by unified economic sanctions. Chancellor Merkel is saying all the right things and if there is truly a united EU response then sanction can work. The US needs to do its part also. Both parties need to come together and put off posturing for the presidency for at least the next few months and project a unified presence against the Russian aggression. If the international community cannot find a way to settle disputes like this without an armed conflict then this world is doomed to fight one war after another until eventually someone presses the wrong button and its no longer a regional conflict.",,

He will foment regional discontent by supplying militants and arms to pro-Russian factions while pining for a cease-fire and peace on the international stage. When the escalation reaches a breaking point his troops amassed on the border will opportunely swoop in to rescue his Russian countrymen from their peril..It is a correct observation that Putin says one thing and does another. It is also correct that sanctions are a logical step. It is also correct to let Germany take a leading role  Putin was a Soviet spy in Germany, speaks fluent German and has a great deal of respect for the Germans  let the Germans lead.",Author Shaffer reflects on a long-standing Soviet-era Stalinist tactic  that of gerrymandering Russian provinces so that ethnic groups more or less shared an equal population base with native Russians. In this way the various ethnic populations within Russia were kept in check by not having a clear provincial majority and thus avoiding situations such as those the Chinese gov't has with the Uyghur population..To achieve this the Soviets also kept the peace economically by divvying out portions of their enormous military industrial machine to each province. And therein may be a key point of Russia's current discontent. Ukraine is ethnically divided  as per Soviet-era design  and it was also where Russian missile rocket systems were built. No longer can Moscow or the Kremlin simply place a call to Ukraine and order up their desired military hardware. Now Russia must negotiate terms and  heaven forbid  actually pay for what they need. Putin is not happy and among other things wants his rocket factory and engineers back.,"Sanctions of this sort will work. When the Russian oligarchs can no longer access their foreign bank accounts and face a future in dealing not with dollars or euros but in rubles the backlash to Putin will hit home...With that said, regardless of any interim steps the most profound message to Putin, his henchmen, Crimea, Russian and the world at large would be the emergence of a prosperous democratic Ukraine. On all levels it is the only option that makes lasting sense.","Freeze Russian assets in the U.S. Boot them out of the G8, Walk out of the room  when they speak at the U.N. Security council. Cyber-attack Russian communications systems  And yes, get China involved in the discussion  they are already taking notes (Taiwan) and the Chinese are scared of civil unrest. Yank away anything and everything that lends credibility to Putin in front of his countrymen  Putin can't be humbled anyway. And lastly, in Putin's mind he is completely rational  put yourself in his shoes  his personal and political vulnerabilities will reveal themselves.","Obama has acted from experience on this issue.

Mr. Putin was one of my personal nightmares. I am of average height while Mr. Putin, despite all the photo manipulation and careful staging done on his behalf, is what I called a little guy. Usually out to prove that they are not going to be pushed around by anyone, probably because they have been previously. Usually very combative and fast with their hands, many had some boxing in their background. Next, the eyes. The eyes tell me I have a live one in front of me. This guy wants to argue. Or, will not say a word, but stare right at you. Next, the attention he is getting by not yielding to the bully doorman, trying to tell him what to do. He feeds on this and likes his time in the spotlight. Usually loners, people like this are proving something to themselves. Sound familiar? The outcome of a confrontation like this was anybody's guess.",,,
A R Dauharry,,,,"Vladimir, thanks for this another 'son de cloche'. What Putin has done is a 'coup de maitre'. Everybody, especially in the West has been blaming the Russian President to be at the origin of everything happening in Ukraine while overlooking everything and everyone else. This is not fair because first we can all see that the interim government of Kiev is playing the West against Russia and it has in its ranks dangerous extremists. The very next day of the 'revolution' it tried to pass a law against Russian language while some half of the population speak that language, as if such decisions would solve the problems of Ukraine. While many commentators don't trust Putin, I don't trust this interim government. The EU that is so happy backing them may very soon discover that Ukraine is more of a liability than an asset..Some self declared experts, fickle-minded people, write all sorts of comments, forget that 'hatred' already existing otherwise why would Kiev attack the mother tongue of a large part of its population. The same people who were saying that Putin is orchestrating events now say he can't back off..I think it is wise that Putin demonstrates by his words and actions that he does not control everything in Ukraine. Not withstanding Russia the Eastern Ukrainians have the same rights as the people of Kiev.","How can so many people are so sure of the territorial ambitions of Putin? Why  would he want to annexe Ukraine when he knows perfectly well that this failed state would be more a liability than an asset? Can't he see what is happening to the EU? The larger it grows the poorer it becomes. Putin knows that what matters in this world today is not territory but money and money is real power..Yes, but what about Crimea? My view is that he didn't start anything, Crimea broke away from Ukraine. Even if he didn't want it, he couldn't do otherwise. Any other would have done the same thing because nobody could have turned his back on the Crimeans in these circumstances which played to his advantages..To those who are so willing to give him a lesson, it would be wise to consider that Russia is not Iraq, libya or Syria.To start a war against Russia  will bring drastic alterations in geopolitics. I would not be surprised to see Talibans fighting for Russia  I would predict that Doomsday won't be far.",,,,,,,,
AER,,,,"According to Putin's logic, peace travels further when fired from a rocket launcher.","So, at the same time as talking up a ceasefire a major Russian backed offensive was planned and launched. That's cynical even by Putin's standards, but it doesn't surprise me in the least. How can you negotiate with someone you  can't trust?",Putin's air of invincibility lies in tatters. I think even he realises this - What happens next may well be as out of his control as the plunging Russian economy.,,,,,,,

observer,,,,"There's hope for Ukranian government yet: Mr. Putin supporters that took over buildings need to be disarmed first, green men need to retreat back to Russia. After all, that's the reason for military operations in the first place...Russia has no credibility and Ukranian leadership would be wise first to see Russia de-escalate.","Really? A bit of wishful thinking: there's no public support for Federation solution in Ukraine, only to transfer some authority to regional governments. There won't be one sided propaganda campaign and intimidation that sealed outcome of Crimean referendum.  Crimea status will continue to keep Russia isolated and under threat of very damaging sanctions. Putin lost any credibility  after denying deploying of Russian troops to take over Crimea and admitting it now..He can't afford to continue  escalation: Russian economy in recession, investors pulling money out, business can''t roll 600 billion in private loans. If he doesn't stop, he will have his Lehman moment.",I guess Putin finally realized what;s happening with Russian economy and more serious damage to come from more sanctions? why would we send troops?,"Once again Cohen is directionally correct but,alas,no cigar.The fundamental issue dates back to the Gorbachev days and action taken by certain reactionary forces,including many in the KGB,to sell state assets and  park billions of dollars overseas so that they can effect regime change should that become necessary.What was initially a politically motivated action morphed into personal greed during the Yeltsin years and was perfected further once Putin rose to Power.Putin was never a political idealist ,he was always pragmatic and oriented towards power as a means of maintaining a status quo of his liking.The actions taken in more recent years both at home and abroad are consistent with such a strategy.Inciting nationalism to quell unrest at home is a tried and tested method for retaining power.Putin's Russia has not done an about tern with regard to relations with the West.It simply doesn't see much need to play nice given that ,sanctions notwithstanding,money talks and his energy based leverage allows him to ignore the West ,saber rattle and secure custom for his natural resources elsewhere.As long as Russia finds willing markets in terms of those resources and foreign players (sovereign and private) willing to enrich themselves through housing and managing the Kleptocracy's assets (money),his game can and will go on.","Oh, cry me a river!. If Putin didn't go to Crimea, celebrate to your heart desire..How can you stand Putin exploiting millions dead for his political gain!!! Atre you feeling any shame standing by and applauding?.Do you ever feel the need to be free or having a strong had in Kremlin matters most? Like Putin said: Motherland first, as he defines it. Seen it before, doesn't end well.","It can't be seen that Putin had direct control over pro-Russian factions. If they were to disarm immediately, it would have been obvious who ordered them in in the first place..Letting them being seen as independent, increases Putin's leverage: allows to use Pro-Russian militants to gain more concessions for now. He can continue to claim Russia had nothing to do with this unrest. It just by accident teams of 20 or so men dressed in uniform, well armed (even with ground  to air missile launchers) took over police stations at same time in multiple cities on Donetsk Kiev highway and were immediatly supported by 50 to 100 armed locals (probably same people who Yanocovich sent to suppress Miadan)...We'll see in a week or so: if US &amp;EU are about to impose more sanctions, then what's Putin's priorities: Russian economy or reclaiming Russian Empire by supporting separatists..If it's latter, sanction would need to bite really bad having quick impact on standards of living in Russia. Otherwise Putin will continue until he's stopped by threat of US military engagement..Russian political elite says exactly that: no reason to worry as long US is not committing to confront them.","The author correctly identifies the theft of Russia's natural resources by the current cabal and it's oligarch partners as a focal point for the West.The seamlessness of the kleptocracy is self evident and implicit when Putin is described in our press as being immensely wealthywithout any attempt to explain how a long term KGB operative and politician could have amassed such wealth.While pillaging of a country's wealth by those in power is not unique to Russia,other culprits are not key players in global  geopolitics.The role Russia plays,currently evident in Syria and the Crimea,as a veto wielding permanent member of the UN security council means that it needs to be held to a higher standard.Western powers in general,including recently disempowered ones like the UK and France,need to get together and determine what an appropriate standard should be.Once defined,Russia should be held to it whatever the impact on these countries's economic self interest.The UK currently stands out as the major culprit in not prioritizing principles above parochial self interest.","I believe this piece is directionally correct but needs to be more nuanced.First,there are very few independent enterprises in Russia.As in China,most are state owned or controlled,but with much less transparency,even when compared to China.Second,the entities in the hands of so called oligarchs are principally assets that belong to the Russian people.Given how those assets were acquired,It is questionable whether the entities who now control those assets should have had any access to capital markets in the first place.Finally,while political considerations may certainly prevail in decisions about the Ukraine,it would be naive to believe that Putin's cabal has no personal economic interests in said enterprises.",,
Gennady Shkliarevsky,,,,"The situation in Ukraine is very serious.  This is a war of nerves.  It is more important than ever that the Western alliance stand united.  Putin has created this crisis by occupying Crimea.  At the time when he decided to occupy Crimea, the Ukrainian government was gaining control over the militants in Kiev.  The occupation weakened the government's position vis-a-vis the militants.  The occupation has also created the momentum for the separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Now Putin, who relies on the support of Russian nationalists, is trying to save his skin.  There are pro-Ukrainian demonstrations going on in St. Petersburg.  A Russian invasion of Ukraine will be a disaster for Russia.  It will unite the Ukrainian government and the population of Ukraine against the invaders and will invigorate the pro-democracy movement in Russia.  Putin should place no conditions.  It is he who created this conundrum.  He signed the agreement that says that militants should free all administrative buildings.  That's what the Ukrainian government is trying to do.  The West must stand united.  We should demand that Russia move its troops away from the border of Ukraine.  If Russia does not comply, the West should impose progressively more severe sanctions until President Putin complies.","Dear CK,..It's a nice way to do polemics:  just call the person with whom you disagree foolish and brand what heshe says nonsense.  I am afraid you will be disappointed.  You are underestimating the commonalities that unite Europe and the U.S.  I do not think that Putin's plan of dividing Europe and America will work.  Purse is not all-powerful and there are considerations other than just money.  What you call US anti-Russianness is a legitimate response to an aggressor who occupies foreign territory and actually fairly reserved response by all standards.  It is unfair on your part to invoke Iraq in a situation that is quite different.  I do not think what you or I say in this situation actually matters all that much in the grand scheme of things.  But this fact does not diminish the importance of maintaining civility and respect for your opponent.  Putin's egocentric belief that the world revolves around him is actually what got him into trouble in the first place.  It will serve you well to learn from this example.","This is a small victory for peace.  President Obama and Chancellor Merkel deserve a credit for making this happen.  President Putin's justification of the separatists' actions in eastern Ukraine makes absolutely no sense.  Two wrongs do not make it right.  And Russia has no business trying to set things right in Ukraine...If Putin retreats in Ukraine, this may create an opportunity for peace and democracy in the region.  The West should avoid a temptation to take advantage of it in order to promote its own selfish interests.  Rather it should act responsibly in the interests of peace, security, and democracy in the region.  Russia should not feel isolated and excluded from this process.  We should prove to Russians that we are their friends.  We should make every effort to act in the best interests of all sides, and not just our own.","Marx once remarked that history repeated itself; first time as tragedy, second as farce.  Putin's empire will be a farce.","This is what I like about Russians.  It is not enough for them to make their point; they feel compelled to go all the way, to their own detriment, to try to smother and diminish their opponent to nothing.  They had a good point:  the militant activists in Kiev should be disarmed and normalcy restored.  No, but that was not enough.  They had to humiliate Ukraine and put it on its knees.  They have simply turned their victory into defeat.  By annexing Crimea they undermined the moderates in Ukraine and strengthened the radical activists.  They unnecessarily alienated the Crimean Tatars and the West.  Yes, the West acts often stupidly and aggressively.  Why then should you?  Why doesn't Russia show the example of moderation and reason?  No, that's not the Russian way.  There are many rational and good points that Russian officials made regarding this crisis.  They insisted on implementing the agreement between Yanukovich and the opposition mediated by the EU.  The Ukrainian government has started to make steps in this direction.  And now all goes back to square one.  Putin has saved the militant activists in Ukraine.  Is this his intention?  If it is, it will be a Pyrrhic victory; and totally unnecessary.  It is time for the West to think hard and not to fall into a trap of responding to force by force.  The West should gather all its wisdom and look for a solution that would use reason, not force.  It is high time for the international community to organize for world peace.","A rare good news for the world.  Wisdom prevailed.  The complications for Putin are not over.  The pro-Russian armed groups are not happy about the decisions in Geneva.  They will obviously feel betrayed, and so will Russian nationalists whom Putin emboldened by taking over Crimea.  It will be interesting to see how move by the Putin government will play on the domestic scene in Russia.  But this is Mr. Putin's concern, not ours.  For now, let's celebrate a small victory for world peace.","Push is coming to shove rapidly in eastern Ukraine.  The Ukrainian government may have no other choice but to use the regular army against the separatists.  In this case, Putin will face two choices:  1.  He may order Russian troops to invade eastern Ukraine.  Such invasion will turn Ukraine into another Chechnya.  Ukrainians, particularly from western Ukraine have much experience in guerrilla fighting.  2.  He may stay out of Ukraine and let the Ukrainian army suppress the separatists, in which case he will lose support of Russian nationalists.  It's a lose-lose situation for Mr. Putin.  He is against the wall.  He may certainly try huffing and puffing without actual invasion but that will not solve the problem.  There are no good choices for him.  There is only bad and worse, and the worse choice is to invade Ukraine and turn it into another Chechnya.  That would be suicidal since Ukraine has a population of 45 mil. and many of them are willing to defend their country.",The problem is that Mr. Putin is under a lot of pressure from his own nationalists on whom he relies for support.  He must rein them in.  The support for secessionists in eastern Ukraine must stop.  The meeting with the O.S.C.E. must focus on the situation in eastern Ukraine.  It is best not to touch Crimea at this point.  The issue of Crimea should be raised when Putin's support among the Russian nationalists is weakened.  The O.S.C.E. should move cautiously and one step at a time.  The Russian nationalists also huddle around Putin.  They are also lost without him.  But this alliance is cracking.  Time works against it.,"The analytical part of this op-ed is right on the money.  The recommendations are weak.  The author does not understand where the key is to solving the problem of Ukraine.  The key is on Maidan, and it is with the militant groups that constantly threaten the government.  They have to be disarmed.  The government is incapable of doing it.  Putin sends messages about the constitutional resolution of the crisis but the U.S. pays no attention.  Why?  It is possible that our side does not understand the situation.  However, the more likely scenario is that we do not know what to do.  What can we do?  We cannot disarm the militants.  The recommendation to support Ukraine makes no sense.  Who do we support?  The government is powerless.  Giving it money is like throwing good money after bad.  They cannot do anything until the militants are disarmed.  And nobody in the government has so far made a decisive move to disarm them.  They do not seem even to have forces to disarm 10K troops amassed in the center of Kiev.","There are signs in Mr. Putin's remarks that he may be losing his mind.  His arguments make absolutely no sense.  By his logic, some parts of Ukraine--Taganrog, for example--that were given to Russia in the 1920s should then be returned to Ukraine.  How far will he go back to revise what has been fixed after WWII?  Next thing he may say that he wants the Baltic republics back or some part of Poland, or parts of Belarus, or Finland, or something equally crazy.  He is obviously desperate and desperate people are dangerous.  He has created this crisis by taking over Crimea.  He did not calculate what this take-over might bring.  And now he wants somebody else to find an  acceptable solution.  Putin should stop interfering in Ukraine.  He should publicly disavow and repudiate the militant secessionists in eastern Ukraine.  Ukraine must hold its next scheduled elections on May 25 and then all other matters should be discussed and settled in an orderly manner by the people of Ukraine and their representatives.  The West should put every conceivable form of pressure on Russia, except a military confrontation.  The most severe sanctions must be in order to forestall any further Russian claims on anybody's territory."
Patricia,,,,"Of course they are, because if it's true then it ruins their entire national narrative of being victims of Putin instead of victims of each other...By the way, when you say Ukrainians, do you only mean those in the west or are you bestowing citizenship on the people who live in the east, too?..How can the Ukraine fix itself when people are denying verbal citizenship to half the citizens of the  country?","I just don't see Putin marching his troops down the Champs-lyses any time, well, in this life, sorry...There is a math problem in the Ukraine that has to be solved somehow. About half the population is pro-Russian. They live mostly in the east and in Crimea.  That half of the population voted for the leader that the western half of the population deposed. So now the eastern half of the population isn't so sure that they want to share the same country with the western half any more...What is your proposal for solving that problem? How can the Ukraine be saved if the country is so divided like that down the middle?..Only the people can save it, by deciding together to rebuild their shattered democratic system. But they don't seem very invested right now in accomplishing that task...I don't see why any blood should be spilled by our troops over their failure.","This is what the national dialogue sounds like in the Ukraine now:..West: Get out of our country,  you stupid evil Russians who starved us during Stalin's time. ..(Even though Stalin was Georgian and his inner circle of henchmen was mostly Georgian too, along with the Ukrainian Khrushchev.)..East: Shut up, we prefer Putin to you guys and we're going to vote to join Russia...(Even though Putin won't be allowing them to vote on much after they join. Or complain too loudly about Putin either.)..I hope they can establish some kind of dialog that goes beyond Stalin and Putin. How else can they share a democracy together, if they can't even have a conversation?","Oh but surely he must be headed for the Baltic states now. Or Poland. Or Hungary. Or France. ..I am no fan of Putin but I knew he'd end up doing this, because he doesn't want those eastern Ukrainians in Russia. Even if they're technically on his side, they're too hard to control.  ..Hillary hasn't been heard from much since her Sudetenland speech. Maybe she's planning her next big I'm not comparing Putin with Hitler but I am speech for when Putin marches his troops down the Champs-lyses...I hope this saga is over because there's been so much manipulation of the media. This whole meme of calling Yanukovych the Russia-backed president instead of admitting the complicating fact that he was elected by 51 of Ukrainian voters has really gotten me irritated and upset over the state of our State Dept. access-controlled press...We don't make laws to censor the press in America like Putin does in Russia. All our government has to do is threaten to deny certain levels of access to any reporter who steps out of line. Self-censorship ensues...That could explain why during this brouhaha it was impossible to learn from press accounts that Yanukovych had been elected by Ukrainians and not just airdropped into Kiev by Putin from a chopper...I hope it's over, for everyone's sake. I hope those folks in Kiev can find a way to rebuild the trust they broke with the eastern population of the country in  Maidan Square.",Putin is a longtime Beatles fan. He was gushing all over Paul McCartney when Sir Paul played in Red Square...Maybe we should have had Paul and Ringo handle these negotiations. Maybe we should put them in charge of communicating with Putin from now on.,"Putin calling for an objective investigation, my Aunt Fanny. If he doesn't know who did this, then he's incompetent as a leader. I hope the victims haunt him for the rest of his life.",This looks very reassuring. Tomorrow is Good Friday. People try to project Communism on Putin but he's a devout Christian. I didn't think he'd be making war on the day Christ was crucified by Rome. I'm glad these people can spend their Easter in peace.,"Yet another day when Putin hasn't personally marched his troops down the Champs Elyse. This is getting tedious. That man is the Devil, I tell you. Satan incarnate for making us all wait so long.","It's kind of interesting that people associate Soviet oppression and brutality with Russians. It's true that Russia was the most populous country in the USSR. But since the USSR was not a democracy, the distribution of power had nothing to do with the size of the population...The USSR was an authoritarian system governed from the top down by the leadership of the Communist Party. But look at the where the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party came from:..Stalin -- Georgia.Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Chernenko  -- Ukraine.Andropov, Gorbachev -- Russia..So half the Party leaders have been Ukrainian and the only Russian thing about Stalin was the fact that the Kremlin was located in Moscow...If you look at it that way, one could argue that Russians have been oppressed by Ukrainians and Georgians, not the other way around...That doesn't make Putin a good person of course. But it does show that it's kind of racist to project all the sins of the Soviet Union on Russians and present the Ukrainians as a bunch of innocent victims in the whole affair...They were up there running the Party, not running from it, during Soviet times.","I wouldn't trust Putin on whether they have mass surveillance or not. But one thing they don't have in Russia is mass incarceration. Putin got on the drug reform bus way back during the Bush administration. He approved a Duma measure to decriminalize personal drug possession in Russia...He did it partly because there is drug-resistant TB in Russian prisons, and probably there were other reasons as well. For example, corrupt police had gotten into the habit of planting drugs on Americans and wealthy Russians and then extorting their parents with demands for money to make the planted evidence disappear...I wouldn't say that Russia has a good prison system, Pussy Riot have told us of the awful human rights abuses abuses there. But at least the Russian prison system  is much smaller. It's eaten a much smaller fraction of their total population than our prison system has consumed of our own...How could that be, if our system if supposed to be the free system and he's the evil demon from the KGB? ..Ask your local representative in Congress about that one. There are some ills that can happen even when your democracy is real and your press is free."
EMK,,,,"What happens if Mr. Putin's objective is not two Ukraines - one western (without industry or natural resources) and one eastern (with industry and natural resources) - but one Ukraine in the Russian sphere of influence?  Is this acceptable to the members of the E.U.?  To the U.S.? What should we get from Mr. Putin in return?..And how do we negotiate for two independent Ukraine's if we are unwilling to fight for one Ukraine?  ..Both the U.S. and the E.U. have shown that they have little stomach for a world without Russia.  Just look at the details of the sanctions.  They are puny.  Wimpy, in fact.  ..Google Putin and Obama images.   I think the image of Putin shirtless, riding a T-rex and Obama riding a girls bike says it all.",Great article.  I knew freedom of the press was in trouble in Russia when Putin cancelled the muppets that lampooned him.  We don't have a T.V.(it's such a time waster) but we do stream TVTeka (so we do waste our time a little.)  We watch the New Years show and the President's midnight address every year.  It's tradition.  It's bizarre.  Our news may be biased and unbalanced but their news is also and in such a decidedly more sinister way.  ..PS Check out the Rain chanel.,Can anyone believe in the competence of the Bundeswehr (German Army)?  That's the question of tomorrow that needs thinking on today.  You can bet that Putin has read reports on the effectiveness of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan.  I have no doubt that Germany would defend its borders but will it arrive in time for the Balts or Poland?,Our success in fracking may free the US of its need to intervene in the mideast but it may create such desperation in Putin's Russia that we will be forced to intervene in Europe when the polite men appear on the shores of Lake Peipus.  ..We should continue to talk but we - and in particular those countries that have ridden the coattails of NATO -  must also prepare to defend ourselves.,"All without fear of ANYONE's reprisal.  So he wins wo a fight (just like in Crimea).  How is that crazy?  ..And when will the winning wo fighting stop?  Seriously, anyone going to bring it over Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia?  And if we don't bring it, how's that going to change the way Poland does business?  And don't forget, all those Russian petro dollars buys a lot of politicians in its former eastern european satrap.  Not to mention further west.  (For example, Mr. G. Shroeder.)  ..Face it, we were hitting the reset button on detente and Putin was hitting the reset button on the cold war.","Look to Mr. Putin's over arching objectives to determine what comes next.  In the short term, he wishes to reconstitute the soviet union.  In the long term, he wishes to create a pan eurasian economic political union that stretches from Lisbon to Beijing with Russia as the keystone and America as its enemy at the gates.  It is not difficult to make a list of Putin's next tactical moves but it may be difficult for the U.S. and Europe to posit a response because we don't have the political will to stop Putin.  Poland is not worth another world war.","America and the EU meted out the punishment that they did because they don't want Putin or Russia to be hurt.  Too many people in the west and east are making money with one another.  For example, former Gernan Chancellor Shroeder is chairman of the board of Nord Stream the agent for Gazprom in europe.  This is all a bit of show for the masses east and the masses west.  The enemy at the gates is the consummate distraction from the 1 per centers and the oligarchs at the top.",,,

Wendell Murray,,,,"Oy, not another one of these articles or opinion pieces. Mr. Cohen might spend some time in Russia, talking to the people for one thing. .. Putin has decided to define his power in conflict with the West...Er, Mr. Putin has had no choice. It is not the West, it is the neo-conservative types, who fully control USA external affairs, who have cause destruction, death, discord and appropriate reaction to USA aggression around the world. ..Russia has been struggling to gain a footing, so to speak, after the dissolution of what was an integrated set of states and the implosion of their economies of somewhere between 50-80. As I usually point out, Mr. Cohen, and similar fools on this topic, might give some thought to something comparable occurring in the USA: 50 states going there separate ways almost overnight, an economic system built over a century disintegrating almost overnight, the country's assets being grabbed by a handful of thieving oligarchs and on and on...As I have noted in commentary to similar articles and opinion pieces herein and elsewhere, I find Mr. Cohen's assertions not only aggressively false, but evidence of a surprisingly shallow mind that makes no effort to understand the most basic facts, if they impinge upon the accepted, absurd ideology of the neo-conservative cadre, of which he is a part at least in this regard, that appears to be intent on destroying the world in one way or another.","Not even bait. The shipment of basic supplies is badly needed in eastern Ukraine. The local citizenry has been under constant assault from the putschists who have no interest whatsoever in the well-being of those they are attacking. The situation is dire in most of eastern Ukraine. People have been fleeing the attacks in droves, mostly going to Russia, but also Belarus, anywhere where the refugees might know someone or not...The moronic reporting, breathlessly trying to allege something heinous on the part of the Russian government, or as usual on the part of Mr. Putin personally, is just that moronic.","I wholeheartedly agree again with Mr. Pollack's accurate and well-written analysis. Please keep it up...I am also puzzled and distressed at the persistent reportingediting - hard to know how much is editing versus reporting - by the NYTimes, otherwise a generally outstanding newspaper, that propagates willingly the lies from the Obama Administration regarding events in Ukraine...Whether Russia has operatives in eastern Ukraine or not in the guise of little green men - who are quite popular among the natives in Crimea and probably in eastern Ukraine, by the way - is irrelevant to anything. Russian governmental action is solely to counter the now decades-long intrusion by the USA into political affairs in Ukraine with the sole objective of putting military and political pressure on Russia under the Putin government. ..At the moment the USA public does not know what clandestine actions the USA government has funded or pursued in Ukraine - very likely some at least - but the overt intervention on behalf of the coup d'etatists could not be clearer to anyone with the slightest objectivity. ..As I repeatedly note, were the USA government interested at all in helping Ukrainians, it would have allocated the 5 billion cited by Ms. Nuland to infrastructure development there, rather than political subversion.","indisputable is that Putin wants the old Soviet Union back..Er. Fully disputable. In fact zero evidence that this is the intention of the Putin government. ..The actions by the Russian government so far are in direct - and appropriate - reaction to USA subversion of politics in Ukraine, and militarily aggressive moves for decades now in eastern Europe.","Sorry, propagandists touting the USA government's propaganda line in response to this comment, but Nancy Great Neck is correct...Mr. McFaul's essay is just one more in a series of such published by the NYTimes on this issue. Pure, unadulterated false propaganda from him...Of course the vilification of Mr. Putin personally has been a key initiative of USA governments since Mr. Putin's election. It apparently was supposed to reach an apex, as I usually note, during the Olympics in Sochi, but it has reached evermore absurd levels with the overthrow of the Ukrainian government and the subsequent actions by the Russian government...As an aside, the Sochi Olympics were spectacular, although the expense for staging them has unfortunately reached an absurd level...The USA government, and its pathetic associates in western Europe primarily, are completely wrong on this issue from every perspective...To repeat, no one decrying neo-imperialism on the part of the USA is approving of the governance in Russia that resulted from the dissolution of the soviet system, the subsequent economic contraction of over 50 (perhaps as high as 80) and the utter social chaos that followed those events...Whether governance by the PutinMedvedev regimes could have been better, given the circumstances, I have no idea, but they and their associates have at least stabilized a devastating situation and reversed materially the impact of the social and economic collapse.","True. ..All the former soviet republics have been struggling mightily to recover from the soviet system's collapse. The rise of the oligarchs since that collapse and their appropriation of the results of the hard work and sacrifice of millions of ordinary former soviet citizens over several generations have only made matters significantly worse...Needless to write, the USA played a role in the rise of the oligarchs in the advice provided by USA-based economists to the Yeltsin government among who knows other actions. Representatives of the USA government were well aware of the almost perpetual state of drunkedness of Mr. Yeltsin and of the potential for irresponsible implementation of recommendations that would result from that...Virtually any Russian without a political ax to grind credits Mr. Putin - along with his associates - with halting the complete chaos after the collapse and making some progress toward stabilization of Russia at least. Ukraine unfortunately continues to suffer with no end in sight at this stage...The USA could easily allocated many billions of dollars toward infrastructure improvement in Ukraine, if it wants to win hearts and minds in Ukraine. It could do this jointly with Russia to everyone's benefit. That rather than endless belligerence emanating from the USA government and its factora in other countries and in USA-based media along with the endless spending on military aggression everywhere in the world.","Putin has proven himself time after time to be a ruthless, murdering, gangster..As I usually ask regarding such statements, would slagheap care to provide any evidence at all for this statement? Repeating foolish lies does not make the lies true.","Someone intentionally fired that missile..No one knows any of the facts yet. Certain however that if the crash was due to a missile launched somewhere - likely, but not certain yet - whoever launched it did so in error. This is a war zone. Tragic mistakes like this occur constantly. At this stage it is as probable that a missile was fired by the Ukrainian forces to try to hit Mr. Putin's plane, but picked the wrong plane, as anything else.","So far as I can tell, Mr. Binion's location is more likely Moscow ID USA than Moskva Rossiya, given his unremitting praise for the putschists in the current Ukrainian national government, including the apparently  - from Mr. Binion's perspective - saintly members of the Fatherland party, largely controlled by convicted embezzler and aspiring mass murderer of Russians - in clearly articulated Russian, not Ukrainian - Yulia Tymoshenko. ..As I usually note, the USA government has no interest whatsoever in the well-being of average Ukrainians, who have suffered from a significant decline in living standards amid massive political chaos. This while Ukraine is a territory that could potentially have the living standards of its geographic mate in the USA, the upper Midwest, e.g. Minnesota, due to its physical and human resources...Far too much of the political chaos has been gratuitously engendered, now furthered, by the USA government starting with the so-called orange revolution, since the dissolution of the soviet system. Ukrainians, much like Georgians under the USA puppet Saakashvili, are at best pawns, at worst, no different than average Iraqis, to be callously destroyed through USA direct or indirect action against Russia since Mr. Putin's ascension to power. The USA actions are reprehensible, as are the statements from Mr. Binion and his cohort in commentary, in support of them.",

He's all about appearances.","It's going to take the Russian people a while to realize that the pain of market reforms is better than the pain of being ruled by an oligarch. Old habits die hard. They didn't like the chaos of the Yeltsin regime, and decided they'd prefer the predictability of a strongman like Putin. But Putin's a loose cannon.

Ask Greece about it..Ukrainians soported European deal only for one reason: they were hoping that Europe will accept them as a member, and many Ukranians would be able to immigrate in this way from their country.","I just astonished by American tolerance to the own hypocrisy. They got cought with their head in the jar, and still they try to switch the blame on Russia. I guess it was Putin's manipulation that Nuland said what she said. I guess Russian have psychic powers as well, to make you tell what you didn't mean to.","And how exactly Putin will stop it ? By telling them ? Telling them what ?.Telling them Hey guys just stop resisting and stuff and let the Kiev army to kill  you already as they can do this on their own. Okeeeey ? And yeh, forget all those civilian casualties  inflicted by indiscriminate bombardment and shelling of your cities...And the rebels will be like No problem, Mr. Putin. They can come and kill us whenever they want if you say so. We have been getting tired of being alive anyway...Poroshenko did a great job of letting the rebels no choice but the struggle. In case of defeat, the only thing that expects the rebels is life in prison, ethnic cleansing and executions. The rebels are currently between the rock and the hard place. I doubt that they will go without struggle even though Putin orders them to. Surrendering to Kiev forces will be equivalent to suicide. no sentient being will commit a suicide willingly.","Why so many Ukrainians in Eastern Ukraine chose Russia and not Ukraine ?.1.  First of all, there is no such thing as a Ukrainian ethnicity..All Ukrainians are basically Russian, except for those living in Lviv who are of Pole origin..Basically the only difference is half of Ukrainians speak Russian and the other half knowsspeaks Ukrainian dialect. And almost everybody knows Russian, even the ones who prefer to speak Ukrainian. The concept of Ukrainians ethnicity has been invented by European powers to saw discord in the former Soviet republic. When we say that Ukrainians and Russians are brothers, this must be taken quite literally, we are the same people. Russia had originated in Kiev. So when someone says that in Ukraine there is only 18 Russian ethnicity and 72 of Ukrainians, he purposefully omit the fact that HALF of the population chose Russian as the main language. Kiev, for example, is mainly a Russian speaking city..2. Ukrainians  have lived in austerity for 23 year already. The self proclaimed government is offering another 20 years of austerity. Is it surprising that Russian-speaking cities would rebel themselves because of this perspective. Those people are simple hard workers, they dont care about European liberalism. They want to work, get paid and speak their native Russian. They dont care of Putin stealing their freedoms as long as he pays them Russian salaries and pensions which are 3 times better than in Uk.","New details come up..1. Malaysia Airlines informs that upon entering Ukrainian airspace, MH17 was instructed by Ukrainian air traffic control to fly at 33,000ft. The original flight high was 35000ft.

Dmitri Ivanov,,,,"Yes, Putin will not be in power forever, and that is exactly why the stance advocated by this editorial is wrong...The official US position promoted in this piece, which claims that Russia has no legitimate concerns in the Ukrainian conflict and that all of such concerns are merely fantasies Mr. Putin is selling, is so extreme, that it will propagate Russian suspicion and animosity towards the US well beyond Mr. Putin's time...Failure to see and admit that reflects either a blatant lack of self awareness or lack of honesty.","I must have been brainwashed by Putin's propaganda, but it does start to seem that the US foreign policy in the former Soviet space is guided by the obsessive desire to have every single former Soviet republic pick the US over Russia as their Best Friend Forever. This policy was probably well-intentioned and benign as the rivalries in my daughter's elementary school class ( after all Putin IS mean), but it does seem to be counterproductive because it is so inherently antagonistic.  There is literally not a single example of the US and Russia pursuing a common goal in the former Soviet territory since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Now that things have spun so dangerously out of control, I can not help but ask: has this policy helped Putin elevate antagonism with the US to almost a national identity status in Russia. This is really disturbing, because this would have been impossible even ten years ago. Most of the blame clearly goes to Putin, but some adjustments in the US foreign policy may also help.  It is probably too late for that at this point.","I agree that Angela Merkel should assume a more active role in an attempt to diffuse the crisis.  Any mutually acceptable deal between the US and Putin has been made all but impossible at this point because it can only come at a huge internal political cost, which neither Obama nor Putin are willing to pay.  However, a compromise viewed as brokered between Germany and Russia is a different story and may even boost the ratings of both Merkel and Putin internally. Let's not be fooled, Putin does care a lot about his popularity with the Russian people.  This has to be taken into account if we want give diplomacy a chance.","Putin's success is that he, with a little help from the West, managed to frame the situation in a way that the majority of the Russian people support his position in this crisis.  Thinking that this is the result of the Putin's propaganda machine is delusional.  This is like thinking that the Fox News audience is being brainwashed by the channel.  It is not propaganda, it is preaching to the choir...Proponents of sanctions and the forceful anti-Putin stance that leaves no face-saving options to Putin should realize that even if successful this approach will create decades of resentment in the Russian population and virtually assure the impossibility of a Western-friendly politician coming to power in Russia in the long years to come...Refusal to engage in a meaningful dialogue with Putin, based on the assumption that Putin's intentions are evil by default, may become a self-fulfilling prophecy...Obama's deal with Putin in Syria is widely viewed as major political liability for the US president.  However, it resulted in the removal of chemical weapons from the country, was that such a bad thing?..Let's be less focused on emerging as winners in the confrontation with Putin and think more about the Ukrainian people who want to have their country back. Restraining from the use of military to suppress internal dissent and initiating a broad national dialogue sounds like a good idea for Ukraine.  Let's not dismiss it only because it came out of Putin's mouth.","When one considers the Russia-US relationship from the domestic politics point of view it is interesting to look at the words politicians use. For example, Putin in his domestic appearances refers to the West as our Western partners. I suppose that this formula is intended to portray any disagreement as some kind of a business dispute and is meant to appeal to the Russians' perception of the West as someone who shares their essential values (although behaving in a very bossy manner). In contrast, I do not think that it would ever occur to any US politician to refer to Putin as partner.","The tone of the article and the convoluted interpretations of Putin's words can serve as a vivid illustration that when dealing with Putin, the West just would not take a Yes for an answer. Simply because it contradicts the stereotypes that everyone worked so hard to create.","This is a very thoughtful piece!.The invasion of Crimea is a highly provocative move that risks turning the Ukrainian political crisis into a Cold War-like antagonism between Russia and the West. However, this is not totally unexpected from president Putin who does not like being humiliated and put in a situation with no face-saving options in a crisis that he can not possibly ignore. The West should have taken that into account and not allow the new Ukrainian government pass a law stripping Russian language of its official status in the Ukraine..We should keep in mind that the Ukraine (as well as many other ex soviet states) exist as independent states in their current borders because of the good will of the Russian people, and the Russian people deserves an expression of good will in return. I suspect that most in Russia would support the ouster of Mr. Yanukovich, had the new Ukrainian government offered a gesture of good will in return instead of effectively disenfranchising the Russian population of the country from their political representation and passing openly hostile legislation..Ukraine should be integrated into the EU, but not in the way that involves installing barbed wire between Ukraine and Russia.  This is not acceptable to Russia and it will not work. The responsibility for the current crisis lies largely on the shoulders of Mr. Yanukovich and the EU, who created a situation in which the ties with Russia and EU integration turned into two incompatible options",I am not sure what you mean by so much time.  This piece is buried deep in the opinion section and I still have not seen anything similar to it in any other US media outlets. The reason to talk about it is because the goal is to find a way of of the crisis.  Calling Putin names is just not going to get us where we want to be.,"The effort by Western governments and media to vilify Putin is misguided...Resorting to personal vendetta instead of focusing on issues can only have one effect: the other side stops listening and hardens its position. Outside attacks on a national leader strengthen hisher domestic support and weaken internal opposition...Unless the goal is to drum up domestic support for a protracted cold-war-style confrontation, akin to the one US has with Cuba or Iran, focusing on Putin's evil personality serves no purpose. It may feel good, but it leads nowhere...Any resolution of the current crisis will require offering Putin some face-saving options. The anti-Putin propaganda only increases political costs of resolving the conflict...The main problem of the Russian society is that it still has not found a way to transition political power without major upheaval and redistribution of wealth. Finding a solution to this problem is only impeded by personal attacks on Putin by the West.","I sincerely hope that the West does not go ahead with major economic sanctions against Russia..It seems to me that the only thing that holds Putin back from direct invasion of Eastern Ukraine is that the majority of the Russian public still would not support such move..The government TV channels in Russia are desperately trying to sway the public opinion, with a lot of help from the Ukrainian military, whose indiscriminate bombing of civilians makes the task easier.  Nevertheless, the public is still not convinced..With the Poroshenko's decision to resume the military operation, there will be plenty more heartwrenching images of killed and maimed civilians and many more tens of thousands of refugees..If the West were to go ahead with the sanctions at that point, that may just prove to be the final straw that would sway the Russian public opinion to overwhelming support of the military intervention in the Eastern Ukraine."

Barbara Michel,,,,"The Ukraine may want to have a relationship with both the west and the east. Given the country's geographical position that is not unrealistic. Mr. Putin wants the relationship to go one way only. That is a hard line position that may not serve him well in the future... It is noteworthy that the Olympics served him well in his current actions. Sochi was filled with soldiers so it was not difficult to move them closer to the Ukraine for 'maneuvers'. The threat of Russian intervention in Crimea and in Ukraine has made the situation more perilous. Mr. Putin should have been watchful, but not directly involved in the conflict. That would have shown him to be a statesman rather than a bully.","The situation in the Ukraine is a complicated one. What would help its citizens is a period of calm. This would give the people who live there a more optimum situation in which to decide about their future course. If they want to engage with the countries in the west and with Russia, they should be able to do so. Perhaps Mr. Putin might consider forging a new relationship with the west. It would be a positive step forward for all involved in this dispute.",Mr Putin may feel he has been betrayed by the west. I feel that he has done the same. His hypocrisy shows in the recent and current photos of him with the Olympic and Paralympic athletes; his current activities undermine the peaceful intent of the games. ..Mr Putin should remove his troops except for those needed to guard the naval base. Those Mr. Putin leaves behind should co-operate with the Ukrainian troops to ensure the security the base. Finally Mr Putin needs to restore his damaged relationship with leaders of major western countries. He should do this immediately.,"Mr Putin and his colleagues are afraid of the freedom that western democracies have. Those who live in countries that are democratic know that keeping them free is a daily challenge. In certain ways it is easier for a leader to tell people what to do and how to think and then back up hisher power with  threats and armed forces. Was anyone really fooled by the seemingly friendly host at the Olympics? If so, surely they now know that Mr. Putin looks to Russia's past and rules his nation with an iron fist that reflects his previous career in the KGB.","What drives Mr Putin is his wish to be a powerful leader. A truly great leader works for the good of the citizens of that country. You do not throw dissenters in jail. Instead you give them the freedom to speak. Such a leader urges his nation to be tolerant of those who are different. A leader does everything he can to ensure that elections provide the citizens with choices. Moreover, the elections must be conducted so that all who can vote are able to do so. I don't see Mr Putin as that kind of a leader. His vision for Russia is lodged in the past. I hope that eventually the wish of his people to be free will triumph. I do not think that this will happen until Mr Putin is no longer the leader of Russia.","Yesterday Roger Cohen wrote this:.President Obama might say this: We need to use the United Nations Security Council and believe that preserving law and order in todays complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos.

The result might have been the same, but it would show that Mr. Putin respects the process of voting in an election that might have had more legitimacy.","Mr Yanukovich should look to the future and re-negotiate with the EU.

We must back up our allies in Europe even if it means individually we must sacrifice.... <a hrefhttp:lstrn.us1hFsmeH titlehttp:lstrn.us1hFsmeH targetblank>http:lstrn.us1hFsmeH<a>","Remember who he is. First and foremost he is a product of the intelligence community. In that community you are either inflicting pain or working to avoid it...Russia is headed by Vladimir Putin who for 16 years served as an officer in the KGB. He is 5'5 and an expert in martial arts. He has a PhD from Leningrad University...He is acting like a man with an inferiority complex. Perhaps it is his height or seeing the perceived power of his country diminish as the Soviet Union collapsed on the world stage. In the west success of a country is defined by how well its citizens are doing economically, the amount of opportunity they have and how much freedom they have to pursue their hopes and dreams. The military is only present to protect these dreams and aspirations...Putin's focus is not on improving the daily lives of Russians. His focus is on bringing back the world glory to the Russian nation. In the United States we see the military as necessary to protect our citizens in their pursuit of happiness. Putin sees the power and glory of the state as the number one priority and the hopes and dreams of its citizens are secondary...We as a people in the United States want other citizens in the world to have the opportunities that we possess. We also recognize there are leaders of other nations that see military might as a means of defining their countries relative success in the world. Unfortunately Putin sees the world this way.... <a hrefhttp:lstrn.us1dQ3fhT titlehttp:lstrn.us1dQ3fhT targetblank>http:lstrn.us1dQ3fhT<a>"

Even a casual observer of world's affairs could have not missed the constant baiting of Putin by the Western press and yes, mostly by the US papers and this even by the most respected ones...The question that should be asked is if the US misses the totally corrupt and Russia's impotent years of Yeltsin presidency? Does Putin strong hold on Russia and his effort to build ,to rebuild, Russia's economy,pose a threat to the US?

Jack Mahoney,,,,"It troubles me that so many opinion writers start with the premise that the world belongs to the US. We should do things in far-flung countries in which we have no right to tread. There will always be opposition politicians who call upon the US to come to their aid, to raise one possibly corrupt faction above another...Consider: (1) there should be a moral authority in the world; and (2) people should be free to make their own national decisions. (Although in the age of predatory multinational companies like Nestle, what do national boundaries actually delineate?) Do we want a shepherd to guide the flock or the anarchy that is consonant with free will?..So, Roger, please do not start with the assumption that the only reason America hasn't landed with heavy boots on the ground in Ukraine is that we're afraid to do so. Perhaps it's because we have no right to do so. Perhaps it's because we remember our Afghan allies in the 1980's. Perhaps it's because we understand what consternation we caused in Guatemala, Chile, Iran, Vietnam, and so many other corners of the world in which we decided to impose our will...I wish those in Ukraine nothing but the best, but while doing so I can also focus on Baltimore and Ferguson, provinces well within our purview where we choose to do nothing to ease the pain of those who live there. ..Yes, Putin is corrupt. So is Citizens United. So is Jeb Bush's non-campaign that grows rich while flouting what few rules there are. Look homeward, Roger.","Here's a good example of how turning your back on a world leader of whom you don't approve can lead not only to baleful results but also to an anxious uncertainty, one that can tempt great nations into escalation...Putin rules Russia. We may not like that, but as long as we act as if pretending he isn't there will make him go away he will make his decisions without our input. We will be left to guess whether the border war is the start of a larger confrontation or a version of the mayhem on this country's Kansas-Missouri border in the 1850's...Consider the slaughter that followed the partition of India and Pakistan. When people fight over a border, they aren't always directed by a puppet-master. ..In the 1950's and 1960's, we acted as if Mao Tse-Tung didn't exist (in fact, we recognized only the island of Formosa as China); we failed to admit that Ho Chi Minh was the actual leader of the Vietnamese; in the ensuing years we became more realistic about China and Vietnam, but we conjured other bogeymen with whom we refused to to negotiate in Chile, Iran, Venezuela, and other places where people made choices with which we disagreed...This year, 55 years after a revolution that threw out a President who had become the tool of United Fruit and the Mob, Cuba reappeared on American maps. ..We don't have to like Russia and Putin to be willing to sit down and talk. Putin's in a tough spot, and in his place I suppose that many of us would consider anyone who isn't a friend an enemy.","When you describe Russia and Putin as darker and malign, you fall into the same Manichean trap that eventually persuaded the Bush Administration to invade a country that had not attacked or even threatened the U.S...The Neocon division of the world into U.S.-controlled and not yet U.S.-controlled appears to be a more aggressive policy stance than anything exhibited by Russia and Mr. Putin. By constantly rubbing other countries' faces in our our ability to send in the Tomahawks and Seals any time we want, we have managed to internationalize the shame and resentment felt toward us until recently chiefly by Middle Eastern Muslims...Those in the State of Texas might reflect on how the State came to join the U.S. First, it was torn away from another sovereign country (that had much less of a relationship with the U.S. than Ukraine historically has had with Russia); then from 1846-48 the U.S. fought a bloody war with Mexico to enforce the annexation. After the U.S. won that war, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo gave the United States the Rio Grande boundary for Texas, and gave the U.S. ownership of California, and a large area comprising New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado...Were our intentions malign? What were our darker motives? Clearly, what we consider our Manifest Destiny we regard as something else when practiced by other nations...I am not saying that any of this is right. However, it might be good to employ just a little perspective.","Your analysis requires two assumptions: (1) people have adequate long-term memories; and (2) the electorate is sane...I would argue that (1) is eminently debatable and (2) fails for lack of evidence...Historian Dan Carlin made the most apt analogy this week when he compared Putin to Reagan. Both were willing to break international law in order to instill pride in their followers and to restore the image of insert name of country here after an ignominious decade...This could be the reason that our right-wing bloviators seem to have a man-crush on a former KGB agent turned presidential pin-up, whose apparent slogan for world domination is Drill, Baby, Drill. In fact, some have proposed that Putin is everything that the Republicans are looking for in a candidate for 2016. Imagine Putin and Professor Warren doing battle at the lecterns. I know I'd watch...So, while you're likely to be right that the long-term consequences of Putin's adventurism will include Russia's continuing isolation from world decision-making, if all politics is local and in the long run we are all dead, it's unlikely that Putin is concerned...Today, it's Morning in Eurasia.","It isn't clear to me how the world came to be ours. The United States of America is but one of many nations on Earth, but to hear the sabre-rattlers tell it, we own the world...In the 1950's, one couldn't escape an incessant wailing by right-wing Republicans (who accused the Republican President and the Republican Chief Justice of being Communists): Who lost China? I was a child, but it seemed evident even to me that China was never ours to lose...It seems that any time indigenous peoples have made decisions contrary to America's narrowly-perceived interests we have been expected to assert our authority. Usually, we have done so by backing autocrats: In Guatemala, Iran, Chile, the Who lost China? crowd was successful in keeping the world safe for United Fruit, American oil companies, and ITT. When our ally in Indonesia wanted to massacre tens of thousands in East Timor, we uttered nary a complaint...Over 50,000 Americans died in Vietnam in a bloody stalemate; yet, even after that sanguinary adventure was over, there were plaintive wails from the America First-ers that we could have conquered Vietnam and made it an American satrapy. ..Later, when our former friend in Panama defied us, out he went. Some socialist in sandals took over the island of Grenada. A made-for-TV war...We're all over the place, and we're all over the world. We respect no nation's sovereignty and no people's right to self-determination...No wonder Putin's recent actions make us so uncomfortable.",,,,,
Look Ahead,,,,"Pro-Russia militia members in their masks are Putin's Brownshirts, the same kind of paramilitary force Hitler employed in his rise to power in Germany...Calling on the Ukrainian military to stand down in the face of a takeover by a Russian paramilitary force is truly Orwellian.","Putin wants to provide cover for corporate leaders so they'll come to his party, the annual economic summit. Many have already withdrawn or plan to send lower level staffers to avoid the wrong kind of photo ops.","In another NYT analysis article, the author claims Putin plays the long game with his military invasions and arms support for rebels. This is the same long game that ended the Soviet Union, bankrupted by their disastrous Afghanistan adventures...Actually, the long game is economics, not military, which is grasped far better by Obama than W Bush. In this sense, Putin is taking Russia down another black hole.","Based on the reactions I read to recent events in Russia, Ukraine and Crimea, it appears that many have forgotten the sequence and relative significance of each. ..Viktor Yanukovych, Putin's ally in Ukraine, is forced from office and his fantasy palace after running the country into the ground. The significance of this is that the vast majority of Ukrainians want to align more with Europe and less with Russia. His departure speeds that process up. This is a MAJOR defeat for Russia and Putin that he had to slow down...Putin seizes Crimea, a small sliver of Ukraine, as a face saving reaction to Ukrainian separatist actions. This was a necessary move for Putin personally to maintain political power but not necessarily a smart move for Russia, given the international reaction and the effect of uniting most of Ukraine against Russia...This will gradually play out with deescalation and diplomacy by Russia, in Ukraine, Syria and Iran, political consolidation by Ukraine and a hold on any progress to add Ukraine to NATO and galvanizing of NATO after a period of cutbacks. ..In the end, Russia has more incentive to emphasize economics over military belligerence, Ukraine is likely to gain from better governance and closer ties with Europe and NATO will get more focused on what it can best accomplish.","Putin is playing a losing game. With almost no allies and NATO increasingly recognizing the reality of his intentions, Russia will face rapidly escalating sanctions. Ukraine will likely receive more military intelligence assistance, making maneuvering more difficult for Russian heavy weaponry.   ..It appears that Obama is trying to give Putin room to achieve a face saving retreat. But its not clear that Putin is right guy for the moment. He is more KGB operative and less international diplomat, as evidenced by the covert nature of this Russian incursion. Hanging around with W Bush was certainly no help either...We can only hope that the Russian oligarchs can influence Putin behind the scene.","Through all of the provocative and obfuscating speeches of the Oligarch-in-Chief, Russian citizens should consider Putin by the company he keeps and doesn't. He has a distinct preference for brutal totalitarians like Bashyr Assad and Kim Jong Un. ..On the other hand, he demonizes the peace loving European Union. Today, he threatened to use both conventional and nuclear weapons against the EU, with the head spinning logic that they are threatening Russia. To the rest of the world, the EU countries collectively are a lagging partner in NATO, under-investing in military infrastructure even as the US closes hundreds of bases in Europe...Propaganda speeches this extreme are clearly meant for domestic consumption. Actions like Crimea annexation, Ukraine destabilization and other provocative military exercises as undersea incursions in Sweden, military flight intercepts and missile deployment exercises are all designed to reinforce the domestic perception of foreign threat...These are disturbing times and it seems that Russians are getting a dangerously distorted view of the rest of the world.","Putin is happy to facilitate chaos in Ukraine if it weakens the drive toward better relations with Europe. He intimidates through forces massed along the Ukraine border, masked Russian gunmen, arming rebels, possibly with deadly Soviet era SAM missiles...In the coming days we can count on hearing a strident Russian government controlled news media insisting without credibility that Ukrainians shot down the civilian airliner. ..Putin is the wrong man at the wrong time, an oligarch and KGB operative who dreams of restoring the Soviet empire when Russia badly needs engagement with the West to advance its outdated economy.","The long game is about international cooperation and alliances. Russia has 3 with other countries, the US over 60. International cooperation is what reduces global poverty, increases international stability and allows nations to combat the greatest threats, like nuclear proliferation and climate change...Prior to Kleptocrat-in-Chief Putin and his merry band of oligarchs, there seemed to be momentum toward international integration with Russia, to modernize their decreipt Soviet era economy, but Putin killed it off for the time being. He has a lot in common with the go-it-alone John Wayne types who dominate the GOP messaging on foreign policy. ..And if the GOP gets back to the White House with another W Bush type, we will put our economy and infrastructure in the tank again, as Putin has in Russia.","Mr Appledorf, ..Justifying or accepting the acts of Putin based on the debacles of past US Presidents (Iraq, Vietnam, etc) is hardly a path to a better world. I think many Americans opposed these colossal blunders from the beginning and the vast majority of Americans now believe they were both wrong and costly in lives and treasure, sold to the public and allies through a series of assurances and lies now apparent through the lens of history. ..The collective memory of Vietnam still echoes in the present, as Iraq will in the future. I think you'll see the US move away from previous strong allies like the Saudis to a more balanced and less interventionist Middle East policy. ..Likewise, the terrible memory of the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe still inspires a rational fear of Russian expansionism. ..The path forward, interrupted temporarily by Putin, is engagement between Russia and Europe to modernize and diversify the Russian economy for the benefit of the larger population, much as happened in China.","Ukraine acting Prime Minister Yatsenyuk predicts that some day Putin will be awarded a medal in Ukraine for unifying the Ukrainian people, against Russia of course. This seems a heavy price to pay for pinching a piece of Ukraine with the population of greater Seattle, while the rest aligns with a more prosperous Europe...While the most conservative elements of the Russian population are marching with banners depicting the disturbing stone faced image of Putin, the forward looking technocrats of Russia are quietly sending out resumes to European and North American organizations, for the reasons cited by Mr Friedman."

The inhabitants were used as a pretext...But let's also be clear.

Force and intimidation.",Putin knows the West will do nothing militarily to stop him...Putin also knows he cannot stand idly by while a revolution happens on his western border in a state that is within his sphere of control...This revolution could be repeated in Red Square in Moscow if enough Russians were similarly outraged.  That he cannot tolerate.  So the Kiev patriots must be crushed...There is no other way.,"The last thing the uber mafia thug Putin wants is for his people to see that all they really need to do to right things is take to the streets.

That's the unspoken truth...The other is that this would be an error of colossal proportions on Putin's part.  He can't afford the Ukrainian's economic disaster anymore than the West can...I'd hate to see the brave people of Kiev get swallowed up by the Russian bear once again, but I'm not sure there are any real alternatives.","The pro-Russian gunman in the picture is armed and equipped like a special forces guy.  It's sloppy journalism on the part of the Times to use that label.  Sorry, but I hold the Times to a higher standard than that...As for Ukraine, we're going to hit Putin where it hurts - in the pocketbook, after he occupies the country ostensibly to protect Russians.  ..Just like in our Iraq debacle, it's going to cost him hundreds of Billions of dollars.  Billions he probably doesn't have...Putin's move will be popular at home now, but not so popular a couple of years from now.  His oligarch friends will desert him once they realize its hurting their businesses and lifestyles, as it will...Stupid is as stupid does.",,,,
Ron Cohen,,,,"Russia has not only intervend in Ukraine, but also in Belarus, Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. While blaming the West, Putin has been engaged in an openly revanchist policy.

The wanted nothing more than self-determination, free of domination by the Russian Bear. We agreed, and made a commitment to them...All the examples cited in this forum of American meddling in the Russian sphere of influence are small-bore, compared to the provocations of Putin and his corrupt cronies, both at home and in the near abroad.","Putin's policy hasn't changed. He saw the car was picking up too much speed, and lifted his foot from the gas pedal. In other words, he saw he was losing control of events -- as this report states -- and moderated his tone. That's all. Not worth all the palaver on this comment thread.","The arguments against sending arms smack of appeasement, the Neville Chamberlain kind. If Russian sons begin returning in body bags, Putin will have to face the wrath of Russian mothers, a formidable force. I do thinks it's possible for the Ukrainians to dig in and make it too costly for Putin to pursue this gambit. They don't have to defeat the Russians, merely bloody their nose...As to the great powers' sphere of influence argument, this is the 21st Century, not the 19th.

Ukraine is no different. ..Against this backdrop, the peoples of Europe and the world have set a new course for the 21st Century, forswearing war and threats of war, substituting the rule of law and a goal of shared prosperity. Grievances between or within nations are to be settled politically. National borders are to be respected. There can be no turning back from this grand vision; the stakes are too high in this interconnected world...Now comes Putin with his revanchist policies, stationing 40,000 troops on the Ukraine border, stirring up the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine, and again risking war in Europe. As Angela Merkel said, he is living in another world. The peace-loving nations may not be able to stop him, but they can assert the new norm, and make him pay a price for his adventures.","The world has changed; this is not the 19th Century. The people of Ukraine are on the Web, on Facebook, on Twitter. They see what the West has and want it for themselves: peace,stability, prosperity...Those who argue (self-righteously) that the West should be more sensitive to Russia's historical, geo-political interests miss the point. Those perceived interests, those power relationships, are no longer relevant or meaningful in the 21st Century. What is relevant and meaningful is comity among nations, rule of law and shared prosperity...However much Putin and his defenders in the West would like to turn the clock back, it is not going to happen.

Let V. Putin try again to make that threat, and see what the nuclear nations of Europe, America, and Asia have to say about this crap. Our western, capitalist, nominally democratic patience are not infinite...I predict that in 12  months both Putin and Kadyrov will be artifacts of East European history, the same as Brezhnev and Andropov were by 1989. ..Don't threaten us, sirs.","Why is the Obama administration obsessed with political transition in Syria? If we remove Assad, who exactly is going to take over? Do the Americans think that democracy is going to magically work in Syria? How did it work out in Iraq? In Libya? In Egypt? I sometime wonder whether Americans are naive or stupid to think that democracy works everywhere and not learn from their mistakes. ..Putin has recognized that if Assad were to fall, there would be chaos in the region and could easily spread to former USSR countries south of Russia. Putin has a clearly stated objective and is willing to commit resources to achieve that objective, as opposed to the U.S. where we are talking half-hearted measures. In this matter, I fully support Russia and hope they succeed.","I guess the left is resentful of all this press about Putin being the winner and Obama being the chump. The most powerful man on the planet is reduced to whining about not being able to do anything to rescue the young girls in Nigeria. He should be getting used to it by now. There was Benghazi where he didnt have a clue, Syria where he tripped over his own red line and Putin ate his lunch, and the IRS scandal where once again he didnt have a clue, the NSA where, well, once more he was clueless, and then he got punked again by Putin in the Ukraine.  The left got their empty suit and now were paying a steep price for being the most powerful country in the world without an effective leaders in charge..Now theres a dirt-bag in Nigeria kidnapping young girls, murdering young men and Obama and Clinton first ignores them, refuses to label them what they clearly are  a terrorist organization, and now the leader of Boko Haram is rubbing our nose in our leaders spineless impotence.  Do you miss Bush yet?","Putin's propaganda machinery could be halted. He could stop supporting the Russian rebels, he could tell them to vacate the buildings and vote in the new elections. He could do a lot of things that he won't do because it would not be consistent with his goal of getting the band back together - i.e. the old Soviet Union - as much as he can.","There will never be another reset, ever...Good one. I remember the placards throughout the Eastern Bloc before the fall of Communism there that proclaimed some variation of the phrase, With The Soviet Union for All Time and Never Otherwise. ..Well, that turned out to be somewhat inaccurate, didn't it? ..Petulant losers is what Putin's circle sound like. Their pride is hurt that America has been smarter and more successful over the last 20 years, the time that has seen the greatest progress in technology since the Industrial Revolution. But Vlad just wants to sell gas, and like schoolyard bullies his boys are going to bash the smart guy's head in for his smarmy braininess. Cool. No better ideas? ..And there will never be another Medvedev? Isn't he the one who wanted Russia to build a techno city modeled after Silicon Valley, to make Russia more competitive in tech? Yeah, get rid of that guy, too, and the dreams of millions of young, bright, talented Russian's who could move their country a few inches into the future, but who are instead leaving it in droves to live and work in the West where their only ideology is to realize their dreams without being forced to march for Putin for the cameras.","Gess, you're absolutely right. Russia is well on its way to freeing itself already from certain American delusions, such as freedom of speech, freedom to associate, right to due process, ... And it's abundantly clear that annexing Crimea can in no way be understood as a wish to re-create an empire. Perhaps Mr. Putin can tell us now what colour he sees when the sky is blue.","If Putin believes the West will stand by while he picks off the former SU satellites, he will do it. It doesn't have to be true; he just has to believe it. Weakness never stopped a war and appeasement never satiated a tyrant whether 5'7 or 6'5.","Well I respect your views, though I don't necessarily agree with all of them. To join the EU you have to have a true democratic government, not merely the facade of one, nor a flash in the pan, democratic election that isn't tainted beyond recognition, as Putin's elections have been. Putin his Oligarch goons are bleeding your country dry. All that oil and gas revenue - where is it going? Off-shore in secret bank accounts. Putin is filthy rich. Where did he get all that money. If you say he's not, you are deluding yourself. If Russia were a true democracy the people would prosper and grow and enjoy a wonderful life with lots of opportunity - kinda like what your leaders enjoy now.","Still, there is a way to go to match Joseph Stalin's misdeeds that amounted to tens of millions dead, which Putin never acknowledges. Yet the US is constantly being criticised from within for everything it does or does not do in the world, and no one is whisked off of the street and booted in the stomach for voicing their opinions. You forget that Saddam Hussein was a savage dictator and that the Taliban want to kill you. It's not like the US is bombing Norway. Be glad.","The oil and gas coin has two sides. The Russian GDP is dependent on selling their natural resources to the West as much or more than the West depends on it for their GDP, etc. Since Putin's thugocracy took control there hasn't been any development of their infrastructure, manufacturing, or social programs. They're too busy robbing the nation blind. Putin's puppet in Ukraine was efficiently robbing that country blind while toeing the Putin line. The difference is the Ukrainian people are stronger and more invested in their own freedom than with being led by the nose as the Russians are."
GEM,,,,"Obama, our Nobel Peace Laureate, is heroically daring to try something world-historically innovative: to lead world politics into this new century of technological revolution and a global economy, by mobilizing diplomacy and precisely targeted economic sanctions to constrain outmoded 20th-century ideas and practices of dictatorship and war. Confronting Putin head-on, on the world stage, explicitly challenging his view of the world as no longer realistic, is a stroke of genius because it is true and Putin is vulnerable (this could not be done with China). Sanctioning Putin's entourage of corrupt billionaires and certain sectors of the Russian economy is a profoundly significant test, against which 20th-century arguments are inadequate. We are witnessing a climactic drama, in which Obama is the protagonist.","What is Putin's long-range strategic purpose in his Ukraine adventure, that might justify the costsnot just human and economic, but diplomatic in international relations and historic in terms of Russia's and his own status in the world? Does he imagine that he can seriously strengthen the Russian economy, enhance the quality of life for Russians, improve his own respect among his peers and in himself, by lying, stealing, bullying, and generally making a fool of himself on the world stage? President Obama says Putin is weakening Russia and proving that it is only a regional power any more. Is this right? This is a highly dangerous situation that needs deeper investigative reporting so ordinary mortals can at least understand it.","Putin hasn't proven anything yet, and this latest adventurism is only a temporary pathological distraction from what he fears most, which is that multinational coalitions supporting popular rebellions against failed dictators may someday come home to Russia. The ancient Greek cycle of hybris-koros-atoverweening pride, born of success, followed inevitably by resentment of the gods against overstepping one's boundaries, followed inevitably by destructionis playing out before us.","This whole episode and discussion are so dja vu all over again with Hitler in the 1930sthe Times is right to try to find the difficult balance between not enough and too much opposition from the West. Putin is just another bully, so appeasement is outbullies are not appeasable. He is not smart enough to realize that strong economic pressures in this global economy can effectively punish Russia and his oligarch buddies. Nonetheless, he can cause a lot of trouble and destruction before he is taken down, so this is a truly dangerous situation. It's very hard to see what the right solution is, so Commenters should perhaps hold off on their quick and facile advice, until greater expertise finds a way out of this crisis.","This column is helpfulI wish David had cited his sources and references, e.g., Masha Gessen's recent biography, et al. It has been reported in the press that Angela Merkel related to Obama on her telephone conversation with Putin, which preceded his, that Putin seems to have lost touch with reality, that he is in a narcissistic bubble of his own world-view; this stuff must be what that refers to. So Obama's long conversation must have been a fascinating exchange of world-views, a dialogue between traditionalist and modernist, Eastern and Western, Old vs. New Paradigms, modern Internet and STEM culture and political economy vs. Russian mystique...But in that case David's take-away is not to the point. Yes, we are not dealing with a 'normal' regime, but I doubt that Obama came away from that conversation thinking he could manipulate Putin or the Russian nation (assuming they share this nonsense). More likely, Obama is now engaged in true world leadershiprecruiting other heads of state to a modernist geopolitical structure that objectively constrains a Russian crusade.","Journalists need to stop asking whether Obama is changing Putin's behavior (no) and illuminate the fact that the confrontation between Putin and reality automatically entails short-run advantages to Putin (who is myopic) but long-run victory to the West, which has the tide of history behind it. Obama's economic sanctions, and Kerry's diplomatic efforts, will not win short-run changes in Putin's behavior, but they will lay the groundwork for long-run victory over petro- and military-dictatorships.","This column is helpfulI wish David had cited his sources and references, e.g., Masha Gessen's recent biography, et al. It has been reported in the press that Angela Merkel related to Obama on her telephone conversation with Putin, which preceded his, that Putin seems to have lost touch with reality, that he is in a narcissistic bubble of his own world-view; this stuff must be what that refers to. So Obama's long conversation must have been a fascinating exchange of world-views, a dialogue between traditionalist and modernist, Eastern and Western, Old vs. New Paradigms, modern Internet and STEM culture and political economy vs. Russian mystique...But in that case David's take-away is not to the point. Yes, we are not dealing with a 'normal' regime, but I doubt that Obama came away from that conversation thinking he could manipulate Putin or the Russian nation (assuming they share this nonsense). More likely, Obama is now engaged in true world leadershiprecruiting other heads of state to a modernist geopolitical structure that objectively constrains a Russian crusade.","Tom is mostly rightabout Putin, the Congress, Obama and NATO; and on the right track about oil and gas. Mobilizing the latter to destabilize Putin (and other petro-dictators) will take some time, but is in the long run sound strategy. In the shorter run, Obama's geopolitical strategy of ramping up Putin's costs of aggression, and his domestic political strategy of teaching by example how stupid and short-sighted are the dying remnants of the Party of Cynicism, are bold, smart, and sound. In both cases President Obama has been dealt cards he did not want and that interfere with his own Presidential goals and plans. Nonetheless, he is providing us with first-rate leadership on both domestic and foreign fronts, in a very difficult time of troubles for our nation. Tom and Obama are in harmony.","We're dealing here with a man (Putin) who, as his recent biographer has said, is not very smart, who has some very dangerous, primitive, ideas about Russia and himself, and who lacks any finesse in pursuing them. He believes that he and Russia can be a world leader for all opponents of Western liberal progressive capitalismi.e., all enemies of global modernization. This includes a lot of losers, because global modernization is driven by technology and is inevitable. Their resistance keeps their peoples down economically and politically, and in particular their youth without viable and desirable futures. So confrontations with the progressive West are nasty, brutish, and short but only from a long-range perspective. While they are happening we are not going to be winners in the short run; we cannot expect Putin to be sensible; and Obamawho is everything Putin is notis going to look comparatively weak especially in opposing military bullying with diplomacy. But he and his tactics are on the right side, the tide of history is at his back, and the West will ultimately win, but only because modernization's enemies have chosen to lose.",
JRR,,,,"You are a breath of fresh air and sanity...If I can sneak another Guardian link past the moderator (who is both intelligent and good looking) - Seumas Milne recently wrote a column which stands in intelligent and stark contrast to the dominant US narrative:..<a hrefhttp:www.theguardian.comcommentisfree2014apr30russia-ukraine-war-kiev-conflict titlehttp:www.theguardian.comcommentisfree2014apr30russia-ukraine-war-kiev-conflict targetblank>http:www.theguardian.comcommentisfree2014apr30russia-ukraine-war-...<a>..There is a tendency to think in binaries - to distribute truth, in its entirety, to one side or the other.

The news media has long been their tool - from Iraq, going back to the USS Maine.  The Lusitania really was carrying arms.  The Gulf of Tonkin was a deliberate lie, and there's at least some credible evidence the American government ignored several warnings regarding an impending attack on Pearl Harbor...It is up to intelligent, peace-loving people to try to find truth amongst the competing narrative...From what I've seen here - we are woefully out-numbered.","To appropriate an old quip:  If Mr. Putin literally walked upon the Black Sea, carrying olive branches to Ukraine, encircled by doves and illuminated by an ethereal light from the heavens - the headline in the New York Times would be Putin Can't Swim.","While some sort of federation is probably for the overall best and indeed, something Putin likely wants - despite the inanities flooding out of CNN and Fox, Russia likely wants a buffer between it and NATO given NATO's relentless expansion over the past 20 years the notion that a USCIA and neo-nazi-backed coup in Kiev is more legitimate than a referendum on autonomy or independence andor rejoining Russia proper is so absurd, one has to be ignorant or simply stupid to actually believe it...There are a lot of very stupid people in the US government who look at the world and its people as mere pawns on the Grand Chessboard...Well, nuclear war is a risk sane people should like to avoid...So where is our Nobel peace prize-winning Puppet in Chief&gt;?..Instead of seeking to diffuse the crisis in something resembling a fair, moderate way, he is doubling down on conflict.

They certainly have credibility for most of the people of Eastern Ukraine, for whom a US-installed Kiev junta, brought to power in contravention of the Ukrainian constitution, with the muscle of actual neonazis and financial backing of cartoonishly corrupt oligarchs most of whom are not even ethnic Ukrainian.  ..No, you don't have to be an apologist for Putin or the Russian perspective to notice the breath-taking hypocrisy and megalomania of Washington, London, Brussels, and Tel Aviv...Let's be clear, the United States government is supporting Al Qaeda in Syria and Neo-Nazis in Kiev...<a hrefhttp:www.zerohedge.comcontributed2014-05-11weve-always-been-war-against-eastasia titlehttp:www.zerohedge.comcontributed2014-05-11weve-always-been-war-against-eastasia targetblank>http:www.zerohedge.comcontributed2014-05-11weve-always-been-war-aga...<a>..What legitimacy does it have?","Thoe who compare Putin to Hitler, apart from likely not being students of history, evidence an odd case of seeing the speck of fascism in certain foreign countries eyes, while ignoring the forest of fascism in their own.",,,,,

NYCLAW,,,,"Putin is a foe who the U.S. and his neighbors have to deal as long as he is in power. Isolate him and clip his wings now. Don't forget, he still has Crimea. The Russian economy must pay dearly now to avoid a second Crimea.",This is the problem with tough guys. They only have one act- aggression. Don't expect Putin to come to the table. His most important audience is the Russian citizens. He cannot afford to look weak under any circumstances. But the reality is catching up. And he is looking for a scapegoat.,"The first good news is that Assad's government may be very close to collapse.  The second good news is that Putin may be expending resources that the Russians do not have.  It is not easy for any power to keep a government like Assad in power after years of civil war- e.g. U.S. in Afghanistan and Vietnam.   ..The bad news is that by Putin forcefully thrusting Russia into the Syrian civil war, this creates more constraints for the U.S. to operate within that theater.  Now the U.S. and Europeans no longer have a monopoly over the sky of Iraq and Syria.","Russians are pursing a strategy of conducting peace talks while simultaneously attacking and carving up Ukraine. This is very effective because the illusion of peace will stop the Western powers- such as Germany and France- from providing meaningful assistance to the Ukrainians. While the Russian territorial gains will discredit-more and more- the current Ukraine government. At the end of the day, any peace talk will only take effect when the Russians feel that they have gained sufficient territories to create a strong buffer between Ukraine and Russia. ..Ukraine does not possess sufficient interest for the U.S. to pursue a comprehensive strategy against the Russians. Putin's only offense to the U.S. is merely his arrogance. His joint venture with Syria has not violated any U.S. vital interest. His violations of Ukraine's sovereignty, however, is a direct challenge to the European Union. The leaders of EU, the French and the German governments, may not be equipped to handle this type pf Russia assault since the EU is only a monetary union. And recently, EU's governance structure has come under severe tests; it may buckle in the near future due to the fact the common good of the union may be outweighed and overruled by the individual interests of its members.","The first good news is that Assad's government may be very close to collapse.

They assumed that the rebels would be another branch of the Russian army since the latter's long term existence largely depends on the mercy of Mother Russia. Now it has evolved into something akin of a parent-child relationship. And the child just did a DWI which killed 200 civilians with the parents' car. ..Nevertheless, withdrawing support for the rebels may not be an option for Putin. His previous nationalistic hard sale to the Russian people on annexing Crimea and other parts of Ukraine may have boxed him into a corner. On the other hand, the downing of the Malaysian 777 and the killing of 150 Europeans may have awakened the European leaders that their continuous acquiescence of the Russian policy of destabilizing Ukraine may cause a severe backlash against them by the European voters. The latest development is bad bad news for Putin and the European leaders...For Obama, however, the latest development on the Ukrainian crisis is nothing but good news. Now, from being a discredited leader who had no idea what his own intelligence agencies were doing, Obama has emerged as a leader with foresight on the danger of a growing Russian power and an international leader who did not just focus on narrow and parochial interests.","Putin is indeed very cleaver. He is aware that the Americans cannot sanction without the unity with the Europeans. His words are to persuade the self-delusional Europeans who are mostly worried about their bottom line while his deeds are to persuade the Ukrainians how far he is willing to go to achieve his goals. He knows the Europeans are weak and focused solely on their bottom line. It is really beginning to appear that the Ukrainians are accepting this new reality and caving in more and more to Russians' demands. The Europeans are not only selling their souls but also betraying the concept of EU. At the end of the day, one has to ask what is the point of EU since it offers its members or soon to be members so little benefits, if any.",There is one major problem with Putin's 7-point plan- he is a liar with zero creditability. Ukraine is much better off if they continue to fight him because Putin is a man who will continue to move the goal post.,"Ukraine has to stop listening to Washington since Obama has no clue on how to deal with Putin. Sadly, some people only understand force and Putin is in the category.","Putin is playing the Russians exactly the way they like to be played; he is playing the macho man of the international politics. He is putting up a good show for them until someone or something that comes along and shatters that illusion. That time could come much sooner than we think. The Russian economy is facing headwind and Crimea could be the maximum extension of its foreign policy. To the outsiders who have a good look, Putin is playing with a very weak hand."
Rob Jons,,,,"Read it, believe it. But don't you understand, Putin feels threatened by the US policy to contain Russia? First in Chechnya, then in Georgia and now Ukraine.

What do you expect? ..The US has many unseemly working partners, China, Saudi Arabia to name two. Russia should be seen the same way, a working partner..ISIS is the big threat, not Russia. In fact Russia could help with ISIS.","Hi Ross. I didn't suggest that Putin was an icon of virtue, I don't believe I have any illusions about who he is..But to simply give US Foreign Policy a pass by saying the US is not perfect disregards a US FP that results in misery and bloodshed..We are way off track at this point and one by one the rest of the world's countries are coming to believe this.",,,,,,,,

In Syria alone, Russia's repeated vetoes in 2012 on the UNSC to protect the Assad regime have allowed Syria to become the refugee and terror problem it is today, despite very accurate predictions put forward by the UN and in July, Novaya Gazeta, one of Russias few remaining independent newspapers, reported on the FSB creating a green corridor to funnel extremists from the Caucuses into Syria to fight with ISIS. This shows Putin and Assad worked hand-in-hand to first protect the Assad regime from being overthrown by Syrians and has worked to discredit the Syrian opposition internationally by helping ISIS take a larger role in Syria to frame the conflict as a struggle against terrorism, despite Putin and Assad's actions that helped ISIS hijack the Syrian revolutioncivil war...Putin hopes to frame his effort as constructive against ISIS for a trade for gaining legitimacy over Russia's Ukrainian territorial annexation while really just propping up Assad against ISIS and legitimate Syrian rebels with the help of Iran and Hezbollah (a terrorist group)...Don't give Putin the time.","Since 2011 when Syrians rose up against Assad demanding equal rights, Russia has used every trick in the book to protect Assad, prop up the Ba'athists and destroy any trust in Putin or Russia...In 2012, Russia led multiple vetoes against the UN plan to save Syria to defend Assad and since then, everything the UN predicted would happen without intervention has.  Then Russia invaded a sovereign nation and annexed Ukrainian territory, shot down a passenger jet killing over 200 people, lied about running a not very covert war in Ukraine, ushered Islamic extremists from the Caucuses into Syria to fight with ISIS using the FSB and now is working with Iran and Hezbollah, a terrorist group, to keep Assad in power despite not having a Syrian base to support the regime...After all that, how could anybody want to give Putin the legitimacy of talking to the U.S. President? Or how could anybody trust Putin's intentions after what Putin and Assad have done?..Respect comes with credibility and Putin has none and does not deserve the U.S. Presidents time.","This was predictable and many politicians and officials from various countries did accurately predict Russia would use the ceasefire to continue to grab more territory...The 64 thousand dollar question is:  Has Merkel, Hollande and the EU learned the right lessons from this to handle diplomacy with Russia?  ..Negotiating with Putin's out-dated realpolitik strategy, that also includes using military force to suit his interests, requires a credible threat of force or Putin will just continue to switch between diplomacy and military attacks to achieve his aims while using Europe's adherence to international law and norms against them.",@Brian Alstead..It would be far easier to not compare Putin to Hitler if Putin did not use the same justifications of ethnic right to take territory by force from an independent Ukraine as the Third Reich did in the start of World War II.,"Igor Girkin is without a doubt GRU and is playing the role of the loose cannon in Ukraine who really is just the human embodiment of Putin's destabilizing realpolitik policy...While Putin talks peace and goes on charm offensives, Girkin is the Kremlin's other side of that policy which destabilizes Ukraine in a manner that the Kremlin can hide behind plausible deniability to the international community.","It is not hard to understand the desire for a strictly politicaldiplomatic solution, as Germany and France are pushing for now.  This is the preferred method of dealing with conflicts that arose out of World War II, United Nations and modern international norms while being a cornerstone of European peace and policy...The problem is, Putin is not playing by enlightened European rules and modern international political and diplomatic norms but rather is using Europe's and the modern worlds expectation and desire to use such legalistic and enlightened methods to push a two-prong plan..One side of the Kremlin's mouth negotiates with the EU and Ukraine speaking of peace, ending conflicts and stability while the other side of the Kremlin's mouth is pushing Russian forces to take and occupy more Ukrainian territory...Ukraine does not have the luxury of time to play Russia's games of doublespeak that Europe seems ready to and each passing week, Russia takes more of their country...Providing modern western defensive military aid is and must always be for the benefit of Ukraine and Ukrainian's to defend themselves from Russia.  It is Ukrainian's country under attack and it is their country being taken in bites by Russia while it is our moral and international duty to help Ukraine defend themselves...Merkel forgets what held Russia back through the Cold War, a wall of steel at their borders that allowed the USSR to rot from within.  Today Ukraine needs their wall of steel.","While Europe and the rest of the democratic world discuss the legalities and politics of providing Ukraine with modern western military hardware to aid Ukraine in the defense of their country; Russian separatists are on an offensive, have already taken a further 500 sq miles and have no interest in peace or ending their Russian supported and guided offensive...While we dither, Ukrainian soldiers are dying and Ukraine is losing territory to an invader.  War is already in Europe and Ukraine and Russia has given nobody any reason to think the Kremlin will lessen its war or involvement when at every juncture they have doubled down on their involvement...Putin is never going to follow international norms and will only negotiate a settlement when his costs are too high to bear.  We've already seen he is ready to sacrifice Russian and Russian's economic stability so now it is time to provide Ukraine with the tools to defend themselves and see if increased Cargo 200 shipments will help Putin admit the obvious and show Russian's the cost of Putin's ambitions.","Merkel forgets what held Russia back from taking all of Berlin or expanding the Soviet empire even further.  It wasn't a political negotiations and it wasn't diplomacy.  It was unbending support for Berliners and Germans from NATO that stood in the way of Russian expansion which allowed for diplomatic negotiations to take place...I am not saying NATO should deploy national forces to Ukraine to create a border that Russia will not cross, but we should be providing Ukraine with the military tools to defend their country from Russia.  ..If Russia gets the idea that the West is weak and won't do anything when Russia's military is attacking and taking Ukrainian territory, who is to say Putin won't challenge European resolve to defend (as an example) Romania, Lithuania or Estonia?..Negotiations and diplomacy will be the cure for this conflict, but not from a position of weakness or while Russia is allowed to pretend it is not in Ukraine.  Russian forces have been continuing to expand their holdings of Ukrainian territory while negotiations take place showing us that Russia has no intention of stopping until stopped...Europe and the U.S. need to unify a position of both political and diplomatic negotiation while strengthening Ukraine's ability to defend themselves and raise the human cost on Russia for Putin's war on Ukraine or we will never see a fruitful negotiation with Russia over Ukraine."

Sarah Palin, and many others praised him as a forceful and decisive leader, while Christian zealots extolled him as the great hope for saving religion from the neo-pagans hordes.","I can't believe that this long article never once referred to Crimea. Did the Western leaders &amp; Putin refuse to discuss it? Did it never come up  hard to believe, since it would be like discussing a ceasefire if US terrorists were fighting Mexico after we had gone and in taken Baja California? I wish there had been a mention of it. ..Or has everyone just decided that Russian naked aggression and taking over a neighbor's territory is the price to pay for peace in our time? If so, these talks should have taken place in Munich.","I can't believe anyone thought Putin  I mean, we're talking about Putin here!  would honor an agreement about anything, let alone a ceasefire. Merkel et al. can't even use the Chamberlain excuse that they were naive dups of a ruthless madman with no honor and no respect for international law. They knew that going into the talks.","Cohen is right about the effect, wrong about the rationale. Putin didn't change Russia. He simply is the latest in a long line of thugs who have taken advantage of the highly unfortunate mania in the Russian people for a brutal, all-powerful leader. ..This is the country that begged Ivan the Terrible back to power, initiating the worst case of self-inflicted national mass murder until Pol Pot; went directly from Tsar Nicholas to Lenin; and lionized Stalin. ..When I was in Moscow several years ago, I came across a young man standing in front of a church that was closed. He was praying and obviously had been there a long time. It was the perfect image of a sad country captive to its past.",This whole editorial is an earnest plea to Putin to stop the war. ..This whole editorial is totally useless.,"Putin is the most dangerous person in the world. Kim in Korea presides over a tiny, bankrupt nation; ditto the other tinpot dictators like Mugabe. Putin is a megalomaniac, a ruthless kleptocrat with not only no moral compass but no compass at all. ..When a man like that is in charge of a nation as large and powerful as Russia, the international community needs to unite in opposing him, by force if necessary, because ultimately that's the only thing brutal, power-hungry street thugs like him understand.","If the reporter had mentioned every major example of the looting of the nation by Putin and his oligarch thugs, the article would have been too long. That said, the staggering overrun for the Sochi Olympics  51 billion to Vancouver's 7 billion four years before  has to come from somewhere. ..It will be the Russian people, have always, will end up paying. The world's lowest birth rate, the highest rate of alcoholism, highest number of abortions (U.S. is 2nd, with not even half the number), average male life expectancy 64. And now they'll probably suffering from inflation and even more shortages of certain necessities, all to satisfy the ego of one man.","Oh come on! Anyone can see that all this is the thinnest of smokescreens for Putin to justify being an aggressive, rapacious thug only interesting in taking whatever he can.

Ainhoa,,,,"Putin was never interested in separating Crimea from Ukraine. He wanted Crimea to obtain more autonomy from Kiev in terms of Russia's future influence over Ukrainian politics.  He aimed at keeping the Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea indefinitely, and remove any limits on its operations, size and replenishment.  He annexed Crimea to the Russian Federation bc the Crimean ppl feared being killed by the Right Sector militias, after the Russian language was banned by the fascists in Kiev. When Putin proposed to Obama a federation for Ukraine, Obama accepted but later changed his mind. All Obama has done is giving us his greatest hits of rhetorical tricks, and talk to Putin as if Putin were a guilty school boy, threatening him with the sacrosanct sanctions.  Obama should have at least taken a course in foreign policy and then asked his dear friend A. Merkel to teach him how to hold a conversation with Putin without warnings &amp; threats.  U.S. sanctions against several Russian companies have prompted Moscow to take action by resorting to the World Trade Org as an international arbiter in the dispute. The Russian authorities, which may launch a lawsuit against the U.S., insist that the sanctions contradict WTO norms, prompting MC and Visa to withdraw sanctions against Russian banks. Today, Ukraine admitted is prepared to settle its gas debt with Russia within 10 days if Gazprom agrees to return the price to 268.  Pay or freeze.","Does Obama realize that he is leading the US and its puppet states to war with Russia and China, or is Obama being manipulated into this disaster by his neoconservative speech writers and government officials?  WW1 (and WW 2) was the result of the ambitions and mistakes of a very small number of people. We are again on the road to War. Today the drive to war is blatantly obvious. The lies are obvious, and the entire West is participating, both media and governments. Canadian PM Stephen Harper, brazenly lied on Canadian TV that Russian President Putin had invaded Crimea, threatened Ukraine, and was restarting the Cold War.  The host of the TV program sat and nodded his head in agreement with these bald-faced lies.   Obama, whose government overthrew the democratically elected government in Ukraine and appointed a stooge government that has threatened the Russian  provinces of Ukraine, falsely accuses Putin of invading and annexing Crimea.  Obamas speech on March 26 at the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels is surreal.  It is beyond hypocrisy. Obama says that Western ideals are challenged by self-determination in Crimea. Russia, Obama says, must be punished by the West for permitting Crimeans to exercise their right to self-determination. Returning a Russian province on its own volition to its mother country where it existed for 200 years is seen by Obama as a dictatorial, anti-democratic act of tyranny.  <a hrefhttp:on.rt.comsbzj4o titlehttp:on.rt.comsbzj4o targetblank>http:on.rt.comsbzj4o<a>","In an article by Mike Whitney, the writer tells that On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a proposal for ending the violence in Ukraine at an OCSE in Europe, in Moscow. Most americans never heard about it because the media doesnt want ppl to know that Putin is not the ghoulish, authoritarian caricature hes portrayed to be, but a levelheaded pragmatist who wants a swift and peaceful resolution to the crisis. Here is what he said: We think the most important thing now is to launch direct dialogue, genuine, full-fledged dialogue between the Kiev authorities and representatives of southeast Ukraine. This dialogue could give people from southeast Ukraine the chance to see that their lawful rights in Ukraine really will be guaranteed.  Does that sound like a bloodthirsty KGB thug whos driven by dreams of territorial expansion and empire-building or does it sound like a responsible leader who wants to facilitate a cease-fire until cooler heads prevail?  Putin called for a genuine dialogue between the Kiev and representatives of southeast Ukraine? Should the media publish critical information like that so ppl can decide for themselves how they feel about Putin? Or is the media entitled to withhold whatever information they choose as long as it benefits their corporate bosses? Is that how a free press is supposed to work?",,,,,,,

MD Cooks,,,,"I agree with Jim Rosenthal's assessment that this was planned out however, more noticeable is the timing that I would like to add. Had this been 2008 or even before the 2012 US presidential elections, these events may not have taken place, but in 2014 Putin knows he has several years to contend with a weak US President.","Mr. Putin has the opportunity to cooperate with the international community for an investigation of this crime, however with each passing hour and day that the OSCE are denied full and un-impeded access to the crash zone by the separatists, one can ask the question how much influence  authority does Putin actually have over the separatists? ..Both Russian and Ukrainian governments both appear to be powerless over the separatists, and since the entire incident is on Ukrainian soil, the Ukrainian government may have more to loose politically to be an effective government the longer OSCE is delayed proper access, since they appear to be placing more effort in the  blame game now rather than setting aside politics to contribute in a joint effort to let the victims be properly identified and laid to rest.","Again there is no hard substance from Obama for Putin to see as a threat to make him, the Russian government and people to rethink things...If this stalemate lasts until the fall, Putin will have the upper hand and literally freeze out his neighbors to the west, which does not negatively impact the US directly but an opportunity to export our resources.",,,,,,,
huth,,,,"I'm not under any illusions.   I think that the eastern and western Ukranians have far more to gain by getting the best-of-both from the EU and Russia, but that seems ridiculously unlikely.   It's tragic.   ..Lavrov is on record as saying that this is purely an internal matter for Ukraine and Putin says that Ukraine needs to revise its constitution.   OK.","I'm not surprised.   Once the Ukraine army began to get the upper hand, Russia invades.   ..I'm beginning to agree with the commentators that Putin has no real long term strategic vision, just improvising.","This is truly tragic.  What I want to believe is that this is a mistake on someone's part, and that someone will actually own up to responsibility, even if it's a matter of ducking for cover by saying this is a war zone.   ..Lacking that, this is one of the most bizarre turns of events in the news this year.   No wonder people are spinning conspiracies right and left.  Just from the comments online, we see some of the following:..1.) Accidental shoot-down by Russian separatists (leading theory in western news).2.) Ukraine meant to shoot down Putin's jet, which supposedly was in the airspace soon before the shooting (mostly from commentators).3.) Same kind of airplane operated by same airline that disappeared mysteriously quite recently and was coincident with the annexation of Crimea..4.) Relative timing of shoot-down with racheted-up sanctions.   ..Probably there are more - e.g. Ukraine did it to blame Moscow, someone else planted a bomb on it.   and so forth. ..Life (and sadly, death) outpaces fiction.","Jim Hoagland in recent WaPo piece on Putin: Shake hands with Vladimir Putin, as I have three times, and you do not feel you are in the presence of a master strategist or a visionary ready to change history with his ideas. Putin comes across in conversation as vain and petulant, with a taste for cruelly needling others.","First, I hope people realize that there is a fairly strong effort to game the comments section here, presumably from Russia.   This is also going on in social media.  ..Having said that, what is most alarming about the situation is what appears to be Putin's detachment from reality.   Any references to US actions in the past, even valid ones, pale in comparison to the specter of a less-than-sane leader with a huge army and an unclear agenda.   Although the Crimea is a major issue, it's what might happen next that has the world alarmed, and rightfully so. ..Points of reference are Merkel's comments about her phone call with Putin and his lack of contact with reality - another is this insistence on having Russian troops move without insignia and wearing face masks.   Nutty.","First, I hope people realize that there is a fairly strong effort to game the comments section here, presumably from Russia.

Mr Magoo 5,,,,"You don't have to ponder much over why currently the administration would leak that Obama's instincts is to talk with Putin.  Since Putin didn't stop supporting Assad even after Ukraine, or lay over and play dead from sanctions, it has now become the time to talk about our differences. There is no differences when actions are driven by greed, may it be Putin, Hassan Rouhani, Assad or Obama.  We may sanction Putin, but we won't invade Russia, nor China, Iran and now Syria like we did Iraq and Afghanistan...After all, Russia has lots of oil and gas and lets not forget their pipelines, which is why we got involved in Afghanistan and Syria.  However the difference is that Russia has nuclear weapons and advanced tactical weapons for the battlefield preventing NATO and the US from direct military action that would lead to WW3.  ..What concerns me is that American and Russian leaders are starting to talk like a nuclear war is winnable.  The World's leadership should be evolving not moving us back into a stone age mentality of drawing lines in the sand saying this is mine, and that is yours until I can take it away from you.","We all need to see and understand Putins historic view of the Ukraine and that it is global greed and activities by EU and US forcing Russia to defend itself...Blaming Putin is a government cover up of our previous economic aggression against Russia, in a ploy often used to stir public emotions for change and support of actions that otherwise would not make sense...For shame, America has now made full circle being in a position that it could reap what we have allowed our government to sow.","Arnold, you are right on the money with this one.  the question no wants to discuss is how our government has and is squeezing Russia over oil and gas getting into EU from Qatar.  Putin in his speech does talk about the underlining issue of aggression by hired terrorists in Syria...While the media and the brainwash masses talk about how bad Putin is and Russia is at the Ukraine problem, we have been misdirected away from our own internal issues by defending our own lies about the real cause.",j. von hettlingen ..Interesting thought.  I wonder if you factored in the gas plant occupied by Russia outside the Crimea in the Ukraine after Rus came into the Crimea...It is my current understanding that this is all about energy prices where the EU has to pay Rus too much for its gas and oil.  EU&amp; US is supporting a pipeline from Qatar through Syria and Turkey to Europe for cheaper energy costs and of course Assad and Putin are opposed.  After the terrorists win with Qatar and Saudis support a pipeline will supply oil to EU and Rus will have a surplus of gas and oil it can't sell.,"Putin has perhaps given Obama a rare opportunity as president to be a world leader that cares about people who are being pushed into conflicts. ..Labeling Obama and Putin does not change the importance of understanding the cause of what could be the start of a global conflict.  It is out of geopolitical and corporate greed, not just from Russia, but from EU and the US over who will control resources that don't belong to them.  ..I have not yet read or watched  press reports from Russia, but it would be interesting to hear Putin's spin on the phone call and compare the two reports. Instead of all of this rhetoric and misdirection we need to look at this from all directions not just our own.","By now I would hope a number of open minded Americans know that this all started over a pipeline through Syria from Qatar to Europe.  ..Ukraine was a ploy to put pressure on Russia to back off its support of Assad, so that terrorists could overthrow Assad, thus establishing a government that would allow the pipeline through Syria...After reading the Russian news reports it seems that there is an incentive in the works that may encourage Putin not to take any more military action...While all this has been going on in the Ukraine, Russia and Saudi Arabia have been negotiating a multi-billion-dollar project to develop natural gas reserves in the Gulf Arab kingdom.  It this happens it will still be Russian gas flowing into Europe lessening Russia's use of its own natural gas.  This could be the win-win that the world needs.  However, that being said we should be openly concerned with all of the lies and misdirection that we have been hearing about Syria and the Ukraine.","Putin is right.  The Wests containment policy on Russia did not start with Ukraine, but he as most of us miss the cause for current sanctions...The cause of hostilities stems from Russias friendship with Iran and Syria.  Putins interference has prevented the US allies and their Mercenary Terrorists from overthrowing the government of Syria.  This started with a geopolitical power struggle between the Saudis and Iran to control the flow of ME energy.  The Saudis want to see the fall of the Syria government, so they can step in, manage and build a gas pipeline from Qatar through Syria and Turkey into the EU.  Putins support of Assad upset this coup attempt to overthrow Assad resulting in many of our Mercenary Terrorists joining ISIS.  While bombing ISIS, Obama is still training more insurgents to overthrow the Syrian government, this time within Syria...More recently, Putin should have backed off supporting Assad and its (BRICS) attempts to move the world away from the US Petro dollar.  One of Putins mistake was thinking that Obama would not move strongly against Russia.  At risk was safeguarding energy needs and US petro-currency.  ..To get even with Putin and to get him to back off his support of Assad, the EU financial community promised trade agreement to get the Ukraine to revolt.  The pro-European revolt disenfranchised parts of the Ukraine that considered themselves Russian dating back before WWII.  To stop Russia,  the US is enlarging its sanctions.","@Jeff Pardun.Bless your heart..I did not attempt to justify the annexation of the Crimea or the fighting in Eastern Ukraine, but to give the causereason not yet publicly disclosed by Putin or Obama in news releases...Russia controls the flow of most of the energy into Europe, because Russias oil and gas has been the key source of energy for the EU.  Europe wants a new source of energy (gas) from Qatar through Syria to EU, but Russia supports Syria who wants the source to be Iran.  ..If you were directly involved since the eighties with corporategovernment dealings in Ukraine, you would fully understand the cause there.  The cause originates with greedy corporations, governments and leaders from both East and West, trying to control the flow of energy (oil and gas) from preferred sources and by building gas pipelines through countries that do not want them. ..What encouraged the initial riots in Ukraine was the International Monetary Fund, European Union, and European Bank.  European Union Foreign Policy-chief, Catherine Ashton got these financial supporters behind her to offer Ukraine a trade agreement if it broke ties with Russia.  One day after the fall of Kiev to the rioters, Catherine Ashton was there offering a deal.  None of that excuses the counter-revolution by Russia in Ukraine or the annexation.",".It is time the EU, US and the Ukraine fully understand that Putin is capable and smart enough to turn the tables any time he wants.  If Putin says stop, the Ukraine better DW stop!  The US is too far away to do much good and Obamas sanctions cannot work against Russia.  EU and NATO face rising costs, because Russia controls their energy.  This all started because Europe wants gas from Qatar thru Syria, however Assad with Putins help have stopped that plan for the moment and is winning a war over hired terrorist by Qatar, which has spilled over into Iraq...It was wrong for the EU to dangle trade agreements in front of western Ukraine that encouraged riots, instead of waiting for a peaceful election in 2015.  Most likely the majority would vote as they did before, ending up with a pro-Russian president instead of a greedy capitalist.  What's happening in the Ukraine has nothing to do with freedom and democracy and everything to do with the control of energy.  Immediately after the riots, the EU advisers were in Kiev.  NATO had plans to box in the Black Sea Russian Navy from supporting Syria fight against terrorists imported in from over 80 countries.  Putin response was to annex and take control of the Crimea...Eventually a pipeline may go through Syria.  Especially, since Qatar with US support is spending trillions hiring terrorists to overthrow Assads government to get a pipeline.  Just in case,  Putin countered by signing an agreement with China to supply energy.","Roger, ..Some good points, however I think you missed much if you limit the corruption to Yanukovych and not Russia and EU.  ..Today, July 7,  William Jones on Press TV:....the violations of agreements that have been made between the United States, Russia and Great Britain with regard to non-intervention in the internal affairs of Ukraine has been grossly violated  And now they are yelling the line saying that we cannot accept this violence that is going on in the Ukraine, WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE CAUSED.   ..I doubt if Greece and Turkey by themselves will be much of a deterrent.  Admiral Kravchenko said, the Baltic &amp; Black Sea fleets are to provide combat-capable vessels within striking distance to backup Putin's plans to restore a permanent presence in the Mediterranean. The increased presence of the Russian Navy in this region can be a decisive factor in making Syrian strategic decisions.  ..Yahoo News, VOA, wn.com, Reuters say the EU DANGLES... aid in return for signing the agreement...Quoting from Reuters 12122013:. Thousands of anti-government protesters gathered in central Kiev, as the EU held out a promise of increased aid  if it signed a trade and cooperation pact. ..EU enlargement chief, pledged more aid to Kiev if it signed the agreement  European officials are in discussion with the IMF, the World Bank and other major financial bodies on ways of helping the ex-Soviet republic SHOULD IT DECIDE TO SIGN the free-trade agreement."
jpduffy3,,,,"History is repeating itself. and Russia is again reverting to strategies and tactics that it used during the height of the Cold War, when Russia was not afraid to use military force as an integral part of its foreign policy, declared the moral decadence of the West, and used the big lie, because, told often enough people would believe that some of it must be true.  ..Putin can do all these things because he is accumulating the powers that Russian dictators once held.  He is using his growing popularity at home and the lack of transparency in Russian government to restore those powers to Russian leadership that he holds firmly in his grasp at this point.  ..The US and the West are giving Russia great latitude to do these things because of a weak and not well articulated foreign policy in the US which stands in sharp contrast to the foreign policy of the US during the Cold War when US foreign policy and leadership was much more dominant and effective than it is today.  ..We need to fight fire with fire and, as Putin and Russia revert to Cold War tactics and strategies, the US must do the same and become again the leader of the West that it once was.

Jason,,,,"Ukraine is a profoundly grey area, as far as I'm concerned for a host of reasons... and I'm not sure we actually have a better option than imposing what sanctions we can.  Ukraine is not a NATP member, not in the EU, and was an economicpolitical hot mess before this conflict erupted. Furthermore it is a profoundly divided country. With a sizeable population in the East actually and genuinely supporting Russia. Infact, until the conflict broke out, I assumed crimea was still part of Russia given its long history and connections to the Russian empire...Are the Ukrainians well served by turning their struggling country into Afghanistan in the 80's? If the West were to Arm the fledgling disorganized western Ukrainians the results would be an immediate disolution into more guerilla warfare with a far more activists and powerful Putin in a full scale invasion. No matter how many guns and rockets are given, it would be a war that they would certainly lose. ..That being said, the West is obligated to do as much as it can to contain Putin.  Build up the military power in the balkans and poland. Continue sanctions on Putin and hurt him economically and diplomatically... but there is no military option that would help Ukraine and at an acceptable cost.","I hardly see how promising to up the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia is, in any way, drawing an unenforceable line in the sand. While it may not affect Putin's decision making in the short run, it will undoubtedly effect his ability to diversify his economy. After all, who on earth would want to invest in businesses in Russia, where a constant threat of nationalization, confiscation, imprisonment, or worse already exists compounded with the added burden of a prospect that your products may be barred from sale anyway because of Russia's belligerence. In this case, the threat alone is action. ..As for Russia's subsidies to the Ukraine, Russia was charging the Ukrainian so much more than the rest of Europe that subsidies were, in effect, already entirely negated. Furthermore, Europe may be unwilling to go in for further sanctions right now while it is so exposed to Russian energy pressure, however, Russia's willingness to violate international law in such an aggressive manner means that the whole of Europe will desperately seek alternatives to Russian energy in the medium to long term, whether through Iran, or dramatic expansion of nuclear and renewables.  Energy is too important to leave in the hands of unreliable, strong, and aggressive adversaries when other alternatives exists. In the medium term, Russia has just shot itself in the foot. In 10 years no Western country will be overly exposed to Russian energy, they can't afford to be.",The only way I see this working is if Putin pays to bail out the Ukraine instead of us.  I do not like the idea that our bailout money will be going directly to Russia. Most of their debt is owed to Russia. Russia annexes Crimea and all of the sudden the debt gets settled. They destabilized the country by basically invading and annexing part of it leaving that country unable to pay the bills. Russia made the mess let them clean it up. As for our relations with Russia we should stop trading with them and sanction the entire country. Cut off their access to our banking systems and pull our companies out. Blacklist all Russian products and companies. If we really object to their behavior let show it. The way it is working right  now Putin is having his way with us.,"Putin could end the civil war and drive out ISIS with the right combination of air support and mostly proxy infantry with advising and artillary provided by Russian special forces. He could do this in a few months if the coordination is right. Once the country is stabalized, diplomacy can begin. I think Putin's motives are obvious, I don't understand all the head-scratching.","That speaks more to the US's system than to absolving Fox for what it says. The fact that Putin and Fox have many of the same talking points should give people at Fox pause. They don't have to come over and support the president, but when you have the same message as a Russian dictator, you should probably find something else to talk about.","Weakness and fecklessness? By doing what? Favoring diplomacy over sending in the marines? I guess the US should send in troops in any unstable country in order to alleviate the fear that one of our adversaries might take advantage of the situation...Or maybe it's because we haven't heard how Obama called up Putin and said he would nuke him if he started anything in the Ukraine...to which Putin replied: ok, I'll see you your nuclear war...To boil this down as Obama's fault for not controlling the leader of a large country with a massive amount of nuclear weapons is to be extremely partisan and to completely forgive Russia's role in all this. In the end, their troops were on the ground first. In the end, they are the ones helping to upset the order inside what was once a stable country. Wars start because one side of a dispute decides to disregard international law, not because someone wasn't tough enough.

Having read the agreement I would like to point out a detail which everyone seems to be overlooking about that agreement:..It involves and speaks only to NUCLEAR WEAPONS!..Whatever Putin is doing certainly hasn't risen to that level yet. The passage that has been quoted in multiple places only puts the Ukraine under our Nuclear Umbrella. It does NOT oblige us to guarantee their borders in the event of a non-nuclear attack...Now, I'm not going to go so far as to say we don't have a treaty of that type, because I don't know. But, the treaty people seem to be referring to isn't it. The only thing that one does is allow the Ukraine to point to us in the event someone threatens to (or actually does) use nuclear weapons against them.","I just want to say that I am really tired of Republican hacks criticizing this president at the time of an international crisis. All of the ridiculous talk about Red Lines in Syria directly resulting in Russia invading the Ukraine, is frankly, absurd. In what Republican fantasy world would the US ever go to war with Russia over essentially a territorial dispute with the Ukraine, which clearly belongs in its sphere of influence. Putin may be many things, an idiot is not one of them. He knows that even if we were blustering and warning, we don't have enough strategic interest in Crimea, where most of the people are Russian citizens anyway, to possibly warrant or justify a military response.  Heck, even the Ukrainians aren't willing to go to war with Russia over Crimea. They let it go without firing a shot. ..Our only rational response is the one Obama is outlying, making the decision to invade as economically painful as possible for as long as necessary. Will it effect Putin's decision making... maybe, maybe not. He may be willing to pay whatever price we are capable of levying against him.  Either way, I'm sorry to both Republicans and Ukrainians,  Putin is right, in this case, we have very little leverage if he is willing to pay our asking price.... and Europe is unwilling to push for a tougher deal.","Weakness and fecklessness? By doing what? Favoring diplomacy over sending in the marines? I guess the US should send in troops in any unstable country in order to alleviate the fear that one of our adversaries might take advantage of the situation...Or maybe it's because we haven't heard how Obama called up Putin and said he would nuke him if he started anything in the Ukraine...to which Putin replied: ok, I'll see you your nuclear war...To boil this down as Obama's fault for not controlling the leader of a large country with a massive amount of nuclear weapons is to be extremely partisan and to completely forgive Russia's role in all this.

Patrick Stevens,,,,"Just as we have made it abundantly clear that we support the rebels in Syria, Putin has done the same in announcing his support for Assad.  Both have stated their positions from the very beginning of this revolution..We have been muddling around in Syria, training fighters, bombing, etc.  Now Russia has entered the conflict with actual fighters and bombing. Both sides say they are fighting for the Syrian people, and both have high sounding ambitions...This sounds to me like the opening scenes to World War III, to me.  Careful!","Just as we have made it abundantly clear that we support the rebels in Syria, Putin has done the same in announcing his support for Assad.

He hides behind his Kremlin Walls as they continue to parade through the wreckage, showing  disdain for the victims and trying to hide their culpability.   ..Where is Western Europe?  Can the West not isolate this rogue leader and stop his outgageous acts?  Shame on us.","Unlike poor Putin, our government leaders have all of Wall Street to provide jobs, polical power, and wealth both in and out of office.   Every week I read a new article or essay about some retiredfired Congressman or former administration bigwig who is now lobbying for a bank, industry,  or other Wall Street interests.  This article just proves that money talks the whole world over.  ..Our government, the greatest democracy in the history of man, is run for and by the filthy rich, so why not Russias?   Why is it that these wealthy Russian friends of Putin singled out here?  He's just following our example of leadership in a capitalist society...Before I get worked up about plitical corruption in Russia, I am going to have to see our own government get its house in order.  We cannot hold the moral, ethical or democratic high ground in our current condition.  Putin is a corrupt and evil man, but, I think, not much moreso than our own leadership.","The reason Putin lies so openly, and with such zeal about his culpability in this disaster is that lies told consistently and forcefully by a leader work to dull the public's response to a grave and stupid error in policy.  His evidence?  Just look to Dick Cheney and others in our last administration as they continue to defend the weapons of mass destruction lies told, not only to the American people, but even in the chambers of the U.N.  ..Countless Iraquis and thousands of Americans lost their lives over that lie, and not one leader has been held accountable in the American or the World courts.  What do you suppose Putin learned from that?  Why would we think that he is any better than our own leaders?  ..Putin should be held accountable for horrific tragedy, but Putin does not stand alone.","It may be that Putin and his forces will invade and control the Ukraine in the very near future, as he has done in the Crimea. He may have it in his head to restore former greatness, or maybe he's just trying to give the West a lesson in geo-politics.  I don't know.  Time will tell...What I do know is that it is difficult for the United States to demand that he stand down after our own historic intrusions into foreign nations within our own geographic area.  Think of Panama or Grenada, or Nicaragua.  Consider our current policies concerning Venezuela or Cuba.  We have thrown our troops and our economic power into the mix numerous time over the past decades to ensure our own supremacy in the West and crush weaker opponents in their own Nations for our own purposes.  ..Why would Putin not do the same as he sees a part of his former Nation moving away from his influence?  We will resist his actions and support the Ukrainian people's quest for freedom, we must.  But stand down from citing our own clean motives and high aspirations.  This is about money and power.  That is all it is about.","After listening to a number of hysterical outbursts concerning the Ukraine crisis, it is good to read a considered, responsible assessment.  Too many of our opposition leaders are too quick to see the actions of Putin as a chance to ravage president Obama and his foreign policy leadership.  Their rancor and divisive speechifying only make a bad situation worse.  The world needs to stand united against Putin.  The world needs the leadership of a strong American President.  We don't need to tear down the only hope a free Ukraine has by destroying President Obama at home.","Just as we have made it abundantly clear that we support the rebels in Syria, Putin has done the same in announcing his support for Assad.

RAP,,,,"Okay, so the United States bears no responsibility in the creation of Mr. Putin's Russia. Just because we started a war on the flimsiest of excuses (WMD's anybody?), have electronically eavesdropped on, well, everybody, have used drones to attack both terrorists and people who look like terrorists without the sanction of the countries the drones fly into; I think you get my drift..Since 1917 things haven't been easy for Russia. The Cold War almost bankrupted the country and a resurgent, saber rattling United States might have caused a little angst in the Kremlin's higher circles, especially with the federal government's own version of stand your ground, the preemptive war of choice..Mr. Putin is doing what Russia, the Rodina Russia, the Russia of the czars, has always done, namely, muscling it's adjacent neighbors continually. Nuclear devices changes the reaction of the West quite a bit and, since we know Mr. Putin does have WMD's, the situations in Ukraine and Crimea will most likely be settled by the Russians as they see fit. Perhaps we should be examining where he might turn his eye next or, silly as it may seem, talk to the guy..In the short run, Mr. Putin's time in the sun will eclipse with the West standing pat and waiting to see what strongman will be Russia's next leader. Until then, I think he just inherited a whole new group of disgruntled citizens who might just do the West's job for it by making life uncomfortable in his new dominions.","Crimea, Ukraine; what next on Mr. Putin's World Tour? It seems the short answer is anywhere his army can drive to. Has our intelligence community, and I realize the oxymoronic inflection in using those two words together, any clue as to the new Czar's intentions? Maybe the NSA can stop monitoring my shopping habits for a few days and do some real intelligence gathering..Otherwise, I suggest letting Mr. Putin grab both areas and be done with it. If he thought he had a problem with Chechnya, he'd best be holding onto his hat as I don't think a large chunk of both populations are very happy with the current bear hug.","Dear Mr. McFaul, Thank you for the insight and ideas of how to deal with the new Russia. I am guessing that all the rhetoric of the collapse of the Soviet Union masked the real problem, Russia and what will be it's new identity..If history tells me anything, Mr. Putin joins a string of strongmen (and at least one women) who have governed Russia from czars to Stalin. The problem, in my eyes, is guessing where Mr. Putin will move next. As far as I can tell, there is little the West can do in Ukraine or Crimea short of starting an actual, shooting war. Economic sanctions seem to, for now, roll off Mr. Putin's back. Our intelligence community, when not busy listening to members of our own government, might want to try and divine Mr. Putin's next expansion..Talking with him still seems an option; remember, we allied with J. Stalin in WW2. Just having a dialogue with Mr. Putin should be a walk in the park compared to that..And, yes, the U.S. is no longer the paragon of democratic principles it used to be; it's tough taking the moral high ground when one has abandoned it with Guantanamo and water boarding seemingly justified.","Dear Mr. Friedman, Try telling all of this to people like ExxonMobil or your average soccer mom who needs, apparently, an SUV as large as an aircraft carrier to bring her kid and the ball to a field somewhere..So what if computer chip technology is rapidly advancing? Oil and it's brethren are, from what I've read, here to stay as the primary source of cheap and available energy until at least 2050 assuming human aided climate change doesn't have the final say in the next three decades (tough to make computer chips when Silicon Valley has been either rattled apart by earthquakes or flooded by enormous rain storms)..As for solar energy, this last winter in New England with clouds, storms, extreme cold weather would indicate that unless major strides are made shortly in the technology, present heating systems will still be used to keep  houses from freezing..Finally, with the entire planet's existence at stake, it's time to stop the here's how we get back at Putin screeds, like yours, and try, for at least the sake of future generations, some co-operation even with the most belligerent of dictators. As far as I know, it's not a game' with the West having to cross the finish line first. Nature is the final arbiter, as you say, but it seems in this country, the bottom line of corporations counts more than what nature might conjure up due to our greed and carelessness..Thanks for being an optimist but it's ALL the mornings after that count.","Dear Mr. Friedman, As Chancellor Bismarck once said, The secret of politics? Make a good treaty with Russia. If the United States could stand by in 1941 while Germany marched into Russia then it seems reasonable that, much like in June of 1941, this country can posture, sanction and wring hands from a distance but stay away from active attempts to thwart Mr. Putin. Callous or not, that region of the world has always been a Russian playground and Vlad the Invader is the big kid in the sand box; our strategic interests are not yet threatened but Europe and the U.S. must stand together if the Russian Bear is coming out of hibernation and doing what it usually does, looking for something else to eat..In the long run, Mr. Putin may be a victim of be careful what you wish for because you might actually get it. His embrace of the Crimea and the Ukraine may just increase his country's internal problems (I would just point to Chechnya as one of those ongoing sources of unrest)..As for Mr. Obama, I believe his options are limited despite the obvious party-driven, saber rattling from people like Mr. McCain. Unlike Iraq or Afghanistan, Russia is a significant military power in the world, second only to the United States in it's ability to project that power..Thanks for the words of caution and wisdom; let's hope the right people figure this out themselves and act accordingly.","To the Editors, After reading how Mr. Putin came to power and maintains his power, I would guess that nothing less than a full blown, military commitment by the United States and NATO will be the only things that might raise his eyebrows in alarm..He's a self-described thug who ruthlessly holds power and squashes those in opposition, world opinion be damned. I think brute power is all he respects (or fears) and if Ukraine is important enough, then boots on the ground is what it will take to stop him, in my opinion..Paramount to all of this is just where does Mr. Putin want to stop? Is Poland on his wish list? If the United States had any kind of credible surveillance agency watching the doings of the Kremlin, we might have a clue; the NSA and all the rest seem bent on spying on us not them..In my eyes, Ukraine will follow Crimea into the Russian maw. Military action will take too long, be too late and do nothing, at this point, but exacerbate an already done deal..Better for America and Europe to prepare, if possible, for the tyrant's next move and show a strong, united front willing to put all actions on the table. Even oligarchs don't like being reduced to cinders in a nuclear exchange and when confronted with a determined West, they just might be able to rein in Mr. Putin.","To the Editors, I have this vague feeling of someone in a pot calling a kettle black, ie, the United States recent activities in Iraq, with thousands of deaths and an unstable regime barely holding on, seems as much of a sham as anything Mr. Putin has done in the Crimea..Remember the never discovered WMD's? The smoking nuclear gun of Ms. Rice? If this country can go to war over misstated threats like those, then Mr. Putin would seem to have every right in the world for his behavior..This country abandoned the moral high ground long ago (Guantanimo anyone?) and should look long and hard in the mirror before condemning someone stepping far outside the bounds of civilized behavior..In the final analysis, much like Cuba in 1963, do we really want to start an international war over either the Ukraine or Crimea?","Dear Mr. Friedman, Mr. Putin may integrate part of Ukraine (or all of Ukraine depending upon his whims) with precious little, outside of sanctions, the West can do. I suggest that he may fall victim to the old adage, be careful what you wish for as you may get it..In this case, Mr. Putin will gain more unrest and rebellious citizens then he initially bargained for. Just remember Chechnya and how well that has worked out for the Motherland..Much like the Czars, Stalin and all the others, Mr.Putin will also pass on; he has described himself as a thug and thugs are always brought low eventually. Since the man has a large nuclear stockpile and the delivery systems, patience really seems the only alternative.","Dear Mr. Friedman, I must admit, I'm confused; you start with Mr. Putin playing hockey and then say we have to get serious about Russia. It seems a little late for that. If he is the thug you portray, we must remember he is a well armed thug and seems to sport the attitude to go along with it, a dangerous combination..I would suggest any ethnic group or territory bordering Russia is at most risk. Crimea is a done deal, for now, and it appears Ukraine will fall into the same category. The West needs to organize, plan and execute a response tailored to where Mr. Putin might go after acquiring these two regions (to me, he will find himself regretting absorbing a whole new group of potential terrorists and bandits as the Russian media describes anyone opposing the government)..I believe Mr. Putin will stop only when the Russian population tires of his shirtless shenanigans and relegate him to the past. Unfortunately, this might take another revolution to accomplish..Meanwhile, the West has to, at the very least, appear to show a united front.","To the Editors, I have this vague feeling of someone in a pot calling a kettle black, ie, the United States recent activities in Iraq, with thousands of deaths and an unstable regime barely holding on, seems as much of a sham as anything Mr. Putin has done in the Crimea..Remember the never discovered WMD's?

A Guy,,,,"So it isn't just Putin. This territorial imperialism is an expression of the soul of the Russian people themselves.  For 450 years, Russia has expanded its borders by military force; from the Greats: Ivan, Peter and Catherine, through the Romanovs and the Soviet commissars, one of two characteristics defining Russia has been military territorial imperialism.  The other characteristic has been acceptance of authoritarian government.  ..With Putin again mocking Western individualism as a social inferiority and this evidence that it is the Russian people themselves are directly funding military expansionism, there can be no doubt that treating Russia as a normal country carries too high a cost: somebody else's freedom.  They deserve their poverty.  You don't do business with a robber holding a gun to your neighbor's head, except at great risk to yourself.","Would you require the Russian pull their irregulars and weapons out before the vote was held?  ..How would that have applied to the Confederate South?  Isn't that exactly what Jefferson Davis wanted England and France to impose on the Union? Didn't he take up arms to impose his insurrection rule on everybody in the South through any means necessary to achieve it?..How do you register free will in an environment of security destabilization imposed from outside?  People would not be voting so much on which nation to be part of as for an end of conflict.  That conflict will not end until Putin's policy is either successful or proven unsuccessful to him.  You pretend that sunshine, lollipops and rainbows  can suddenly spring forth, as if in your suburban neighborhood.  Your suggestion rewards Putin for his behavior.  Would he restart the security destabilization after the vote? Does he not say the rejection of his puppet by the whole nation of Ukraine was a provocation and a fraud?  Would he not go onto the next piece of the old Soviet Empire he wants to rebuild? ..Rub the hopeful horse manure out of your eyes.",,,,,,,,

Sure Greece is a corrupt backwater, and Italy was ruled by a disgusting clown for a while, but the level of corruption achieved by the Ukrainian government puts these folks to shame. Sadly, Putin offers an even worse alternative since Ukraine is at least semi-democratic where people can demonstrate and voice their opinions. The Russian Federation in comparison is a black hole.","While I agree with your analysis that Yanukovych played Putin for as much as he could get, the Russian Federation in no major rising power.

rusalka,,,,"World leaders have to make it very clear to Putin that his demand for control over Ukraines foreign policy is a non-starter. In acknowledging the aforementioned, that Russias goal for Ukraine can never be realized, it is essential to start to take apart this manufactured conflict. The Minsk agreements are the blueprint to achieve this. It is of the utmost importance that the whole border between Russia and Ukraine be monitored by the OSCE or the UN. All convoys of materials entering Ukraine must come through recognized border control points and must be inspected by an organization such as the Red Cross. Fighting must stop, now. The OSCE must expand their mission so that they can more thoroughly oversee events in the present conflict zone, an area to which it must be insisted that they have absolute unobstructed access...These measures cannot reasonably be refused by any person who genuinely wants to see peace in Ukraine. But this is not enough alone. The Minsk agreements also have a requirement for local elections to take place in eastern Ukraine, the measures suggested will allow that to happen, but at the same time the genuine leaders of the communities affected by this conflict need to step forward and lead. With a backdrop of peace they must stand up and participate in the process of gaining the trust of local citizens and represent their wishes in Ukraines expanded genuine democratic structure.",Both Stephen Cohen and Mearsheimer are Putin apologists.

Here's the truth:.. Putin engineered a series of coups in Eastern Ukraine that toppled the elected government there, only to install a brutal, fascist-leaning bunch of thugs willing to do his bidding.  It is Russia--as usual--that refuses to understand and acknowledge the central role that Ukrainian history and culture plays in this region, and the will of Ukrainians, of all ethnicities, to determine their own fate. The War Party in the Kremlin seems determined to provoke war somewhere and at all times, i.e., Georgia, Transnistria, Crimea, and Eastern Ukraine, for starters.   War is always good for diverting the attention of the Russian populace from its government's inability to face and solve economic problems at home.","An accompanying story in the Times today includes the following quote:  The Obama administration, which has indicated that it would send antitank missiles, surveillance drones and other far more serious battlefield weapons to Ukraine, said those plans would be shelved, for now, but would be revived if the parties failed to honor the agreement..         Anti-tank missiles and surveillance drones are, by definition, primarily defensive weapons, that would enable Ukrainian soldiers to better protect themselves, and to defend their land from the vicious aggression of Kremlin-backed militants and  invading Russian army units.   At the very least, such defensive weaponry and equipment should still be sent by the US to Ukraine..         The Times editorial board chooses to characterize all of these weapons as lethal, in order to justify its position that sanctions alone will tame Putin's bloodlust and alter his imperial mindset.","In reply to judyw:  You should see the palaces that Putin has built for himself (go to <a hrefhttp:PBS.com titlePBS.com targetblank>PBS.com<a> to see the Frontline documentary on Putin, with several shots of Putin's utterly tasteless Versailles-would-be-shamed PALACE OF CORRUPTION in Sochi).

NYT Reader,,,,"I would not be so quick to dismiss Lavrov's description of what happened in Ukraine as a coup.  To most Russians, not just Putin and his circle, the deposition of a democratically elected President, whatever his failings, by street protests and tacit military backing, with clear and visible Western instigation, was certainly a coup.  Yanukovich had won an election.  He represents a not insignificant number of pro-Russian Ukrainians.  The irony is that to argue that it was a popular uprising not a coup would require calling the Egyptian coup a popular uprising as well, since it was identical (a popularly backed military overthrow of an elected president, followed by new elections and new government).  I suspect Mr Cohen and most western observers would shudder at the comparison.  For what its worth, when Putin told Merkel that the West has systematically defaulted on its promises to Gorbachev not to expand NATO and the EU to Russia's borders, he was not wrong.

(I did this for all 3 wars.)..While I have strongly condemned America's interventionism, there is a major difference between the latter and Putin's aggression in Ukraine and Georgia...In all 3 American interventions, we did so on the side of freedom from tyranny. These invasions were astonishingly stupid, and hundreds of thousands of innocent people were killed. All three wars were immense tragedies. But we never invaded those countries to annex them, or to steal their resources, as Russia has done. Only the most closed-minded ideologue would believe that Russia's aggressions in Georgia and Ukraine were for the benefit of the people of those nations...As in any crime, motive is of paramount importance. In American criminal terminology, our 3 stupid wars were gross misdemeanors. Russia's invasions of Georgia and Ukraine (not to mention the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe following WW2) were felonious.","The best weapon against Vladimir Putin and his clique is the truth. ..When most Russians learn the truth about Putin, he will be kicked out of office.

Either Europe will muster its intellectual, moral, political, and economic energies to think big, to become a player, or it will devolve into a 21st century version of what it was a century ago at the outbreak of World War I.","Much of what McFaul says could, if one changed some of the nouns, apply to America, especially regarding international behavior within one's sphere of influence (e.g. Cuba, Grenada, El Salvador.)

Russia's motivation is more than just protecting ethnic Russians in the Ukraine, solidifying control of its warm-water port, or reestablishing a reliable buffer between itself and potentially hostile regions. ..Likely, much of what is going on is that President Putin has studied and learned from President Reagan's policy to economically break the Soviet Union by forcing it to spend more than it could afford on its military in response to rationally perceived (whether real or not) American military threats. Quite possibly Putin has decided that he can bankrupt other American policies by pushing us to again fund preparations for a land war in Europe, which our military and political planners had essentially taken off the table.","It has seemed to me from the first that Putin may have adapted to his own objectives President Reagan's policy of escalate-until-you-bankrupt-the-other-guy. ..Ever since World War II Europe has been living and prospering under an American defense shield. In recent years, America decided that continuing such was simply too expensive in an age of a two-decades gone Soviet Union. Meanwhile, European complacency failed to fill the consequent vacuum. What started out as a combination of economic subsidy to a rebuilding Europe and a way to maintain a coherent front against the Soviet Union, turned into first a dependency and then a mindset of Europe. ..From Putin's perspective, a little low-cost sabre rattling could put the U.S. in the position of having to reverse its military draw-down in Europe, an incredibly expensive situation for America. After all, Europe really has no plans, let alone ability, to stop a Russian invasion. ..Of course the more consequent  --  even if unlikely  --  risk is that France, N.A.T.O., or the U.S., having no ability to stop an actual Russian ground advance, would be seriously tempted to use tactical battlefield nukes.",,,

With Saudi Arabia flooding the market, and Iran's oil soon to come back on the market, the value of Russia's oil continues to drop, resulting in Putin and his cronies heading toward bankruptcy...Putin is desperate. Putin needs the price of oil back up to at least 100 per barrel, otherwise his house of cards will ultimately collapse.","Normally, I'd advocate talks with other world leaders. With Putin, though, I'd suggest not. It will only further bolster Putin's delusional sense of self-importance. He's a failed, corrupt dictator who's taking his country down the toilet and who's throwing his military around internationally in a desperate attempt to tap into his people's nationalism in order to maintain whatever support among them that he can. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from talks with him. No point in giving Putin propaganda fodder...BTW, to all the Putin-paid trolls who are flooding this comment section: We know who you are and we know who's paying you.

And not just from the US, but from the EU nations...Should have inserted troops into Crimea after it was clear what Russia was up to but before Ukraine withdrew.

More talk certainly isn't going to make any difference.","Obama and the leaders of every EU country should be deeply ashamed. Putin continues to literally get away with murder, as he brazenly extends his conquest of Ukraine. And, the news media, including the NYT, should be ashamed as well. They continue to parrot the Putin-inspired myth that it's separatist rebels fighting in Ukraine rather than who's really leading the attack - the Russian military. And, if anyone believes that this so-called cease fire will ever hold, they're kidding themselves, yet again. Putin will not stop until all of Ukraine is under his kleptocratic rule. Then, it'll be the Baltic states and Moldavia.

There are other non-ISIS groups in Syria, such as the Nusrah Front, which are a threat to Russia, Syria and have also been a target of the U.S., so the situation is from clear. What is clear is that if we wanted a say in what Russia plans to do, we should have accepted Putin's offer to join forces against ISIS (and perhaps al Qaeda affiliates who are also fighting in Syria). Instead, we make accusations that sound hollow (Russia, which has been invited in by the government of Syria has no right to intervene in the region, but we do, Russian military aid will destabilize the region while it is us who have done the destabilizing), and continue our insistence that Assad must leave office, a demand for which we have no international authority or legitimacy to make.","Tom Friedman is a highly influential columnist and it bothers me that he has accepted the U.S. government version of the Ukrainian situation hook, line and sinker. What this means is that he denies that Putin's behavior with regard to Ukraine has any real logic in terms of defense of Russia and its interests against an encroaching NATO expansion (which he admits has existed), and that ethnic Russians who speak Russian are being discriminated against, robbed of political power and, as recent revelations about the use of cluster-bombs have shown, killed, because of their ethnicity and language by a fascist-leaning Ukrainian government. Putin is stubborn, belligerent, aggressive and suspicious. Friedman admits that the West needs Putin to become a partner, even a  limited one, and not a constant adversary with no acknowledgment of common interests, but his own rhetoric, filled with our government's catchwords for Putin, such as thug influence public opinion (as well as the opinion of lawmakers who read Friedman) away from seeking such cooperation. Friedman is helping paint a picture of Putin as a leader with whom it is impossible for us to work. That is a dead-end street that will only serve to futher harden the divisions between Russia and the West.","Why do U.S. stories about Putin and Russia always stress Putin's ulterior motives, his ambition, and use words such as pushed through the Federation Council, portraying Russian actions as suspect when we don't describe American actions in the same way?

Our only chance of defeating ISIS is with a coalition of forces and Russia should be part of that coalition. Of course Putin will attempt to aid Assad and keep him in power and we can't use that fact as a reason not to cooperate. Neither can we insist that Assad leave as a condition for anything, as that is a nonstarter with an Assad ally, such as Russia. But we can ask Putin to concentrate on fighting ISIS, not anti-Assad rebels and on pressing Assad for political compromise with his opponents. In turn, Putin has a legitimate right to ask us to stop supporting anti-Assad rebels (who have plenty of support from other Sunni countries) at least for a period of time and to stop calling for Assad's departure. Both of these kind of agreements would be radical changes in both  Obama's and Putin's strategies so far and represent true compromise from both sides. The only other major player in the region right now is Iran, which is fighting both anti-Assad rebels and ISIS (in both Syria and Iraq). Cooperation with Putin would allow us to coordinate with Iran's military effort against ISIS through Putin as a third party, and we would not have to publicly alter our entrenched position against cooperating with Iran (foolish as that position may be).","Western reporting continues to focus on Putin as the aggressor and to frame this conflict in terms of reigniting the cold war, blaming it upon Putin's desire to recreate the USSR. Within Ukraine, right wing groups succeeded in banning Russia as an official language, kept oligarchs in power and centralized power in Kiev. NATO  has made noises about including Ukraine, has increased its troop levels and has broken promises to Russia about expanding Eastward in Europe. It would be nice to see more balanced reporting of these issues instead of simply regurgitating the official EU, NATO and American pronouncements.","Mr. Putins plan now seems to be to keep Ukraine out of NATO  Mr. Putin's plan, which he hardly kept secret, has always been to keep Ukraine out of Nato. Early on he said that Russia could not tolerate NATO ships using the Russian Naval base in Sevastopol as their own. That was his motivation for annexing Crimea. We seem to forget that the West, including the U.S. promised Gorbachev that NATO would not be extended eastward in exchange for his releasing Eastern European nations from the USSR. That promise has already been violated and now NATO is threatening to be on Russia's doorstep. Putin's tactics are duplicitous and primitive and ignore international law, however, his reasons, which are rarely discussed in editorials such as this, make sense. He feels he has his back against a wall, which, in fact, he does.

As we have seen regarding Syria and Ukraine US diplomacy tends to re-interpret road maps and - rather than using them as a sketchy basis for future negotiations - it uses them as a kind of sacred text to beat up its adversaries...I don't see much use for a round table at this point. Yatsenyuk promised a national coalition before he took over. It is also the usual code of conduct in this kind of situations. So do it. That will place the dialogue where it belongs: in Ukraine's national politics...The article makes far reaching claims regarding Putin's objectives regarding Ukraine, claiming he wants it weak and dependent. Yet it fails to mention realistic Russian demands like continuing economic relations with Ukraine's East, a neutral position between Russia and NATO and no boycotts against Transdniester and Crimea.

It is NATO muscling into smaller countries on Russia's borders - Latvia, Estonia etc. by engineering their inclusion in NATO and making plans to include larger countries like Ukraine and Poland into NATO, and plans to put Missile Defense System in Poland (ostensibly to deter Iranian Nukes which US has declared it will never allow Iran to have) that got Putin and Russia spooked. It is like the old Soviet Union 'accepting' Cuba and Venezuela into Warsaw pact and eying Mexico and Canada as the next candidates while putting Russian Missile Defense Systems in Brazil. How would have US reacted?.The analogy may not be exact but then why rub Russia's nose with NATO expansion in the former Soviet Union countries? Especially when there is no more Soviet Union or its military arm-  Warsaw pact?.US and Western European countries who are mired in economic malaise and national debts up to their eyeballs should spend their energy and resources more wisely than pushing for unnecessary militaristic expansion of NATO. To use what is happening in Ukraine now as justification for NATO's expansion would be dis-ingenuous as we might not be here if not for expansionist NATO in the first place..Putin makes this argument and whether you like him or what he is doing, it is a logical argument.","Eric L.

Then take some action -even if it's unilateral. That's what Putin did. He took Crimea and he is keeping it. What are you going to do about it?","Eric L.

Putin sees U.S and NATO meddling in Russia's back yard - Ukraine exactly how we would see Russian meddling in our back yard - Mexico. Besides, with U.S. and NATO getting ready to pull out of Afghanistan, coming up on make or break deal with Iran in few months, having strained relations with China and the U.S. having a spat with India over trade relations Putin knows he has many cards in his deck to pay back the favors if U.S. decides to get tough with Russia through economic sanctions andor military aid to Ukraine.

Interested,,,,Do you honestly think that Vladimir Putin reads more than a quick excerpt of the dailies from around the world--presuming that his factotums dare present him with even more than that--or that he gives a hoot for what the Western media says when he decides what jobs he hands out to said factotums each morning?,"You do know that the Balt republics are members of NATO and, therefore, subject to a Section 5 claim for self-defense and that Ukraine is not?  ..Now it may be a fact that NATO is too dead to respond to the invocation of a Section 5 claim by a member but I would not want to test that if I were Mr. Putin or be so sure, as Mr. Scowman, says that we would let him have the Balts.","Mr. Friedman, you simply cannot be serious: the answer is your carbon tax and natural gas (provided it is extracted at the highest environmental standards)?..I am not advocating for war but hard as you try to justify the seizure of a chunk of Ukraine because Russian-speakers live there...this is the madness and fatuousness of Chamberlain accepting at face value the seizure of the Sudetenland because German-speakers lived in Czechoslovakia...It's been four days.  I hope that Mr. Obama and the Europeans will find some way to allow Stalin Junior to reconsider his revanchist policy and withdraw to his perfectly secure Crimean naval base.  ..I don't know any better what will happen during the next few weeks than you do but I doubt that Mr. Putin is seriously worried about a carbon tax right now.  ..You don't seem to have learned much from your righteous advocacy of American intervention in Iraq because you surely have developed a strong brief for Russian intervention in Crimea...Economic sanctions, some visa restrictions on the children of army marshals studying at the Sorbonne and export controls on the hundreds of billions that the oligarchs have stashed in banks throughout Europe may get Putin's attention right now rather than in 2024 when all those new environmentally appropriate natural gas refineries, pipelines and port facilities have been constructed.",,,,,,,

DanGood,,,,Your comment makes no sense: follow the money or lack thereof. Do you mean no matter where the money leads (as if you knew) Putin is responsible?,"It is not the Kremlim seeking to establish autonomous republics in eastern Ukraine; it is the eastern Ukrainians. Why is this such a implausible thesis? After Maidan the new Kiev government immediately passed a law outlawing the Russian language and effectively outlawing the Party of Regions, which represented the east to a large extent. Putin had nothing to do with these developments. Why insist he is evil genius behind Ukraine dysfunction? American and European financial firms, consultants and accounting firms as well as NGO's have been active in Kiev since the early 1990's where they filled their pockets with fees to create oligarchs. Meantime Russia was reinventing itself after the collapse of communism. Russia had nothing to do with what is going on in Ukraine yet it is being blamed and called on to end the bloodshed. Readers know this but are powerless to influence the editorial slant and unfair reporting from the western press.","For anyone actually watching, Putin seemed fully in control of his emotions and his mind. The sanctions are a real annoyance to him, no doubt, but he cannot change his policies on account of them. This is clear. As for the wild currency fluctuations, the best is to sit it out. Russian fundamentals are strong, the Russian people are patient and not upset. So all and all it the the US that is making a fool of itself. As an American I am neither embarrassed nor upset. it's pretty much par for the course. We have people in the State Dept who take themselves too seriously and have a real problem understanding what is really going on. America has another big problem that has nothing to do with Russia. Its real problem is the racket to which it is subject: we live in an arms racket, aka a protection racket. The economy is so hooked on military that even though there is no enemy we keep spending. Russia knows this and probably has some sympathy, having lived through it in the waning years of the Soviet Union.",,,,,,,

First, no bomb, bomb Iran and now diplomacy with the Putin over Ukraine, what next? Remember all the hype about Obama daring to meet leaders without preconditions? It may have been a rocky start, but Obama seems to be a quick study. There is a big difference between the multi-national group that Bush put together to show he had numerous countries, albeit mostly very small ones, in his international coalition to enter Iraq, but Obama has put together a coalition that has some bite behind it's bark and Putin's inner circle is feeling the crunch. It's got to be really tough on the conservative talk circuit to try and continue to malign Obama as a weakling on the international stage.","If it is true that Yanukovych and his governmental allies stole as much as 70 billion dollars it may have seemed prudent to the populace that the sooner he was gone the better for the country. Aside from that, his making agreements with Putin, when a majority of the public wanted closer ties with the west and the EU, was threatening the loss of the ability to make those changes possible was the last straw. What has happened in Crimea is proof that the fears the average Ukrainian had about what closer ties with Putin might create were legitimate. Had Putin thought Crimean cessation were legitimate he wouldn't have been afraid to allow a vote of the people of Ukraine or even in Crimea. No country, yours or any one else's would allow a neighboring state to come in and annex territory. Putin has a history of taking such actions. In light of this, the Ukrainian population had every right to be alarmed about such agreements being made with Putin. Put yourself in their shoes. If your leadership were making arrangements with a foreign power that a majority of your nation disagreed with and even after massive demonstrations continued to do so, would you want to wait until after there were no way to take back such arrangements?","Have you not been following the news since this war started?

SNillissen,,,,"That is foolish talk.  If the US begins funding the Ukraine military, Putin may very well send troops and air power into the Ukraine.  And remember, Putin still has many thousands of mid range nukes, and Russian military doctrine includes the use of them....even in a conventional war if needed.","I see here the hoards of readers who have been taken in by the US narrative in this struggle. They like to think this is about Putin, when in actuality, any other Russian leader would have responded to the US and EU challenge in Ukraine without any noticeable differences from what Putin has done.  This is a geopolitical struggle on the Russian frontier.  Have our dear readers forgotten about Great Power Politics and vital strategic interests?  The US knew damn well that the little NulandPyatt coup would cause this conflagration, and that Europe would have to clean the mess up.  For those who want to continue the moronic American led rant about Putin, I recommend reading the comments of John Mearsheimer and Stephen Cohen on this crisis.  Ukraine will never be NATO, for it will have to be a neutral state, a buffer state if you will, which does business with both east and west.  Let us remember that Russia's 15 billion had no strings attached, security or otherwise.  Read the EU deal, and one can sniff out the foul aroma of USA fingerprints on the documents.","Putin was in Minsk because the west wanted him there, and they claim he is behind the conflagration.","There are far too many US trolls on this site.  First of all Debaltseve should have been surrendered in the negotiations last week.  Secondly, only poorly educated fools would make this crisis about Putin (it seems the NYT is full of such people).  This is a major geopolitical struggle just off the Russian frontier.  It really doesnt matter who the leader of Russia is, because any leader would have acted as Putin did.  What is reckless is that the US was willing to orchestrate a coup in a country bordering another great power.  There is ample evidence to support this assertion (listen to the NulasndPyatt phone conversation, or check out the involvement of US NGO's.  Don't you wonder why Russia threw them out long ago?)..Some here call for arming Ukraine, without bothering to think about the consequences.  The introduction of US drones in this fight would likely mean Russian air power would  also become part of the equation.  The simple fact is that we have no track record or clear understanding about how an east-west struggle would escalate.  What we do know is that Russia would be prepared to use everything in its arsenal to take on the US and NATO.  Russian military doctrine includes the use, when necessary, of tactical battlefield nuclear weapons.  What next?  This is a dangerous game.  We can no more beat the Russians than they can us, and they dont rely so heavily upon conventional forces, so, expect nuclear armaments to be at the ready.",I have been to Russian twice during the Putin years.  The state is hardly more onerous and iun your face there than here in the US.  As to elections:  Those in Russia are no more ofr a sham than those in the US.,"The west refuses to acknowledge that Russia will not allow them to meddle on their borders, or in bordering states, just as we didn't allow it in Cuba.  Listen to the Nuland conversation with the US Ukranian ambassador, as they planned their little coup.  Putin isn't playing games, the west is.","I have been in Russia four times in the past decade or so, and Putin is hardly some authoritarian bully in that country.  People speak freely, and have many freedoms such as ours...The US has 5 of the worlds population and 25 of those incarcerated world wide. So, where are you more likely to be thrown in jail?","Friedman refuses to acknowledge that this crisis has been orchestrated by the US.  He apparently has not bothered to read the Victoria Nuland  Coup planning transcript with the US ambassador to Ukraine.  Putin wants Ukraine to be neutral.  That, however, is not what the US wants...First, this crisis is done if Ukraine is neutral, without US games being played behind the scenes, such as those that preceded the Yanukovich ouster...Secondly if Ukraine and the west do not try to turn Ukraine NATO, which Friedman barely addresses.  There has been enough loose talk by US politicians on this","Obama tried to play Putin with the CIA backed Ukrainian coup, and Putin is responding to it no differently than I would.  The Russians have warned us on NATO involvement in both Ukraine and Georgia.  We havent got the message?  There is also the little matter of pipeline gas going through the Ukraine.  Is it in the US interest to disrupt it?",
Diogenes,,,,"The mythology President Putin is not veering from is close to the truth. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, President George H. W. Bush promised President Gorbachev that the United States would maintain friendly relations and would not encroach upon the borders of the Soviet Union. The opposite happened. Especially under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. and NATO actively courted the countries of eastern Europe to join the military alliance which was originally formed as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. If NATO had been disbanded when the Soviet Union collapsed, we might very well be living in a saner, safer world.","McFaul is trying to re-start the cold war, using Kennan's theory of containment. It is the result of failed US policies toward Russia going back to the Clinton Administration. Clinton aggressively pushed for the expansion of NATO to include Poland and other countries of eastern Europe. More recently, the neo-con assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, was recorded telling the Ukrainians the US would help overthrow Yanukoyvch. The fact that many of these Ukrainians were neo-nazis did not deter her and therefore the United States...What was President Putin to do in the face of these hostile actions?","So Putin wants to be undisputed ruler of the Black Sea? Let him! Perhaps the Russians will flex their muscles by sending their Black Sea fleet out to sack my hometown of Sinope (they've done it before). I recommend he invade Kazakhstan to reassert Russian hegemony over the Aral Sea, too. ..Crimea has no land access from Russia, and Putin will quickly come to regret the costs, both economic and political, of maintaining this retirement enclave for aging Russian sailors. Maybe he can rally the local populace further by staging reenactments of the slaughter of the Light Brigade. But it is the Ukranians, not Putin, who will win this standoff in the long run.

Wesley,,,,"A promising step, but with Putin I would definitely use Reagan's approach to treaties with the former Soviet Union - trust but verify. Putin's the sort of Machiavellian autocrat who would use a pull back as a pretext for invasion, so this is certainly no time to lessen international pressure on Russia to stand down completely from their unprovoked aggression and get out of Ukrainian territory (including Crimea.)","Brilliant editorial. This is 100 at the feet of Vladimir Putin. And the blood of the innocents killed in yesterday's attack are on his hands. He stoked, orchestrated, armed and supported the Russian separatists in Ukraine. His state controlled media fans the flames of insurgency there with a litany of defend the motherland lies. And now he has the audacity to blame Ukraine which is trying to combat his insurgency without provoking a full-fledged Russian invasion for not controlling what happens in its own territory. The world has allowed Putin to strut about like a belligerent shadow of Peter the Great for too long. It's time for reckoning.","Putin's facetious rationale for invading Ukraine originally was his desire to protect Russian speakers from majority Ukrainians. Sounds like we need to protect Ukrainians from the Russian speakers, in Crimea and beyond. Those seem to be some fairly well supplied protesters in the Post photo by the way... We need to stop playing games with the blowhard regional tyrant Putin. If his troops step foot beyond Crimea the consequences must be severe... including re-establishment of missile defense arrangements throughout the region, and any other NATO oriented steps that Putin opposes.","This is a time for drawing red lines for Putin. And enforcing them. History has shown that often the quickest way in to a conflict is being too timid and passive in an attempt to avoid it. This moment requires boldness from the U.S. and Europe. If Putin dares venture beyond his unlawful invasion of Ukrainian territory in Crimea, then a series of much more serious repercussions should ensue... starting with immediate shipment of missile defense systems to all his NATO neighbors, NATO exercises in the Black Sea, permanent dismissal from the G8, and exploring dismissal of Russia from the UN Security Council. Passivity in this moment leads us closer to conflict with an emboldened Putin than boldness in reining him in would do.","The U.S. supports democracy in Ukraine, post-Russian puppet Yanukovich, and the opportunity for all Ukrainians, east and west, to finally choose a leader who represents the interests of Ukraine instead of the parochial interests of mother Russia. We oppose Putin's invasion of Crimea, and Russian theft of Ukrainian territory, and we will continue to oppose the aggressor Putin's militaristic threats against weaker neighbor states like Ukraine. My only regret is that we're not reacting much more strongly to Putin. I think that his actions should eliminate Russia from G8 on a permanent basis, should call to question Russia's role on the UN Security Council, and should speed up US efforts to bring Ukraine into NATO and European efforts to unite Ukraine with the European Union.","While these mild slaps on the wrist of Putin's inner circle are somewhat symbolic, they're also largely useless, and are so weak that they could even prove counter-productive. I think that the U.S. should lead with the imposition of major economic sanctions against Russia, and force the hands of the predictably weak and dependent Western European nations to do the same. This is a time for the Western world to stand against the Third World dictator tactics of Putin's Russia, and to penalize Russia for its invasion and theft of sovereign Ukrainian territory. And for its refusal to uphold the recent LavrovKerry agreement. A tyrant like Putin understands only force, and mild reproaches like these can serve only to embolden him. It's time to start fighting fire with fire.","Great work by the Ukrainian intelligence officials. Of-course this vote is merely a part of a show being orchestrated from Moscow by puppet-master Putin. He lost his favorite corrupt Ukrainian puppet Yanukovich, when the Ukrainian people threw him out, and he went whimpering back to Moscow. Now Putin has his own infiltrated green men, his Moscow operatives and his new separatist puppets in Eastern Ukraine, plotting yet another illegitimate and dishonest referendum. It's time for the worldwide community nations to call Putin on these charades, and exact a heavy price on Russia.","Your blind faith in the honesty and uprightness of Vladimir Putin is touching, albeit naive, uninformed and willfully ignorant of the KGB master's past behavior which would in no way be inconsistent with the deceptive plot calls intercepted by the Ukrainian intelligence officials.","Putin is quite the poker player, and he's playing his hand via surrogates inside Eastern Ukraine. I think this is the perfect moment to call Putin's hand, and raise it. President Obama should announce that the U.S. is reinstating its plan to stage missile defense systems in Eastern Europe to protect the citizens there from any rogue elements, since so much seems uncertain at the moment... with various groups claiming to be the government of cities in Eastern Ukraine etc. U.S. ships should be loaded with anti-missile systems and headed to ports like Gdansk, Poland and Constanta, Romania... We could simply state our shared interest with President Putin in peace and stability in the region. Let's see how he likes those cards...","It's a good start, but I would like to see something more substantive like... kicking Russia out of the G8, restarting talks with Eastern European nations regarding positioning US missile defense systems, and working with the Europeans to jump start discussions on having Ukraine join both NATO and the EU. Let's do the really substantive things that Putin does care about... he really couldn't care less about some of his cronies having their travel options curtailed."

Sasha,,,,"It's now obvious that Putin and Lavrov have absolutely nobody to talk to, never mind negotiate with. Obama and Kerry have no plan, no ideas, nothing but the same hypocritical and sanctimonious hectoring that every American President regurgitates at these events, no matter that it's now so over the top with hypocrisy that it's simply bizarre. That's because they're absolutely powerless to formulate anything, as their role is simply that of a front-man for the MIC that dictates US policy. They are nothing more than messengers. I think Putin (amongst many) is well aware of this, and that may explain the extreme infrequency of his personal dealings with Obama. He addressed the American people directly in his NYT interview of a few years ago, and again through Charlie Rose the other evening. No matter what side of the fence one is on, this is cause for tremendous concern, and should be especially for the American people. They may as well have a hologram for a President.","Excellent piece. I had the same thought as some who've commented here, on what it would be like subsiding on a week of US news. While I'm sure a number of neuroses would arise, you can't compare it to the Russian TV channels. Our media practice sensation and spin, Putin's media is a self-contained alternate reality machine. Its far from China or North Korea - a closed system of direct control. Russia's media, though controlled, isn't nearly as closed, hence the feeling you get is of a viewership somewhat choosing to engage in a fantasy parallel universe. As the walls crumble around them, their choice is only reinforced. More mad-house than jail-house. It's quite disturbing.","If the eventual evidence puts the finger on Russia or Russian separatists, Putin will be in a very difficult position. Most of his Ukrainian 'adventure' was for domestic pride building as an example of Russia's might. If it turns out that his newly proud Russian forces messed up and shot down an innocent plane, he'll be right back to where he started - incapable of controlling events around him with a military not yet 'ready for prime time'.  Does he admit the mistake? Or does he double-down on conspiracy theories and dig in to Rouge state status for good?","Some commenters here just repeat the old Cold War stereotype RussiaBad.

Jodi,,,,"Sandy,.Yes, please before speaking further about the benign intentions of Vladimir Putin and Mother Russia read the Bloodlands.  This is the true character and Nature of Mr. Putin and his cadre of former KGB Stalinists.  Father Stalin would be proud of Vlad.  He is a cold blooded despot that cares nothing for his people or any other nation.  Next will be larger than life statues of Putin adorning Red Square.  Putin is this generations evil, sociopath.  These types are always with us and it is up to the rest of the world that carry the seeds of civilization to recognize them and do everything within their power to stop them.  So far it looks as though sanctions are working.  God help us if they don't.  Remember this sociopath, Mr. Putin is a government of one in a nation bristling with nuclear armaments, we are dealing with a Russian Kim Jong Un. The world should hold their opinion until we see what happens in Crimea.  McDonalds pulled out because there are no food supplies available to make burgers or salads.  The major supplier went from 20 trucks a day to one a week, maybe.  I see famine and misery on the horizon for those unfortunates in Crimea, not to mention, the round up and deportation of all Non Russians.  Mr. Putin has effectively shut off all outside communication in Russia and Crimea.  That is the first step toward the beginning of brutalization of his own people who don't agree with him.  This man is extremely dangerous.","The only reason missiles are pointed at Russia is that for 70 years Russia has threatened just about every nation on Earth.  NATO was enacted to counter act Russian Hegemony and naked aggression after World War II.  The Eastern European nations, now struggling to birth democracies,  are trying to desperately pull away from a thousand years of despotic rule with no history whatsoever of any kind of democratic rule, no Magna Carter, No Constitutional Monarchy, no Parliamentarian govt.  Vladimir Putin is one of a few leaders of Modern nations that still wants to rule in the archaic repressive militaristic way.  All the nations of the world have to do everything in their power both economically, and diplomatically to help the Ukrainian people move toward some form of democratic rule sans systemic corruption.  The only alternative for them is once again fall back into the sphere of despotism that is Russia, that produces the likes of Yanukovitch and his son.  It is unfortunate and yes heartbreaking that Russia continually century after century stifles any kind of democratic movement within its boarders.  I for one would like nothing more than to see Russia take it's rightful place among the nations of the free world, as a full trading partner, open to cultural exchange, full scientific endeavors, tourism, and add its own rich and varied history to helping all the rest of us solve the monumental challenges of our time. Vladimir Putin is not the leader Russia needs or deserves","Modest?  How many people has modest Mr. Putin Killed or murdered to further his own interests?  Modest interest?  He and a hand full of oligarchs have managed to consolidate the wealth of entire nation, along with all power in every branch of the Russian government.  The whole structure is rotten to the core.  Do your self a favor and read the real truth about Putins rise to power.  Reminds me of a former paper hanger...................and everyone said he was a genius too and thought he was what Germany needed to restore her place in the world, trouble is he wasn't content with his own borders either..............","Ragozzi,.Do you have any concept of the term International Law?  Putin broke the law and invaded a sovereign country for the purpose of stealing it's military bases.  I don't know where you are getting your information, RT, Russian TV?  Which is nothing but Kremlin party line propaganda.  RT, is headed up by a group of individuals that would make Goebbels proud.  For the past 23 years Putin has assassinated, arrested, murdered, any voices of dissent.  This is a man seeking peace?  This is a man with an evil agenda.  He thinks he is the incarnation of Prince Vladimir of the 10th Century, who is building the Empire of Russia and driving back the Turks and Mongol hordes.  Wake up.  If the entire free world does not come to their senses and isolate Russia now we will pay for it with a civil war in Ukraine and worse. Putin wants a war make no mistake about that.  He has personally absorbed all the humiliation of the crumbling of communism and the great Soviet Union and wants to revive something akin to it with a little Russian Tsarist twist.",Alcimar.This is true. Putin is guilty not only of fomenting this disaster but many more in the past and surely plenty more in the future..I hope you 'enjoy' your relationship with russia in the coming days as a member of BRIC..You should see great advances in wealth and prosperity as a member of said group.,"Please, Please read Kicking the Kremlin, and the Bloodlands, These two books represent who Putin is.  He is not a grown-up, he is a KGB, fascist and he will stop at nothing to completely crush any one or any entity that opposes him.  I simply can not believe the naivet on this board.  Nothing has changed people.  Putin is nothing like a western or European leader.  He is a cruel, and savage individual.  This is the most serious threat that the free world has faced since the Cuban missile crisis. Putin has imprisoned and is continuing to ramp up the gulag for those in Russia who voice any form of dissent or opposition.  I fear a full scale Russian revolution within the next 5 years or sooner.  Russia is reinventing itself once again, hopefully the rest of the Free world will not have to go to war to stop the new ideology of Empire Putin in proposing.  Never forget he is KGB.  Nothing that comes out of his mouth is truth on any level.","If Putin is without guile in the sending of humanitarian aide, which his proxies have created the need for.........in the immortal words of Ronald Regan, who by the way was an astute Russian observer,   Trust but verify.  So, Mr. Putin, why would you object to those benevolent cargo trucks being stopped, their contents unloaded, inspected, for transfer across the border?:  The expense of doing so referred to by Lavrov  is chump change to a man of your personal  wealth purported to be over 100 billion.  Don't you all here find that interesting as well?  How did a lowly KGB officer suddenly become one of the worlds richest men?  Hummmmmmm?","The western  Democracies and the US  on it's worst and most hypocritical day bares no comparison to Russian hegemony.  Western thought and policies of the last 1000 years have done more to lift the lowliest of peoples from hunger and hopelessness than any other civilization in the History of the world.  Perfect, no?  Cynical at times, yes? Brutal at times? Yes.  But no where in the history of time itself can it in anyway be compared to Russia and it's mind bending and horrific past, nor its present.  Russia is the wests ISIL, at this point.  Putin has picked up the mantel of his forbearers, and he using deceit, deception, falsities, and outright lies to further his ill conceived plan to rekindle the glory of the Soviet Empire.  The whole free world better pick a side  This ride is going to get really dicey.  I lament what is going to happen to the Russian people, once again they are going to suffer for the delusional policies of their leaders. Putin, like Lenin, is the reformed bacillus let loose on the world...............god help us.","huh? Wow, what a commentary.  So, if war starts its all our fault?  I just said that, standing in my kitchen talking to my husband.  It's always America's fault.  You just proved that Mr. Pollack.  Unbelievable.  And if it is, so be it..To Mr. Putin I would say in the words of General William Tecumseh Sherman: You are rushing into war with one of the most powerful, ingeniously mechanical and determined people on earth........you are bound to fail.",
Don Williams,,,,"This Times column greatly overstates Russia's gains.   The militants have only gained a very small part of eastern Ukraine -- the areas that voted about 75 for Yanukovich.   However, the areas to the west leading up to the Dnieper River  --who had also supported Yanukovich but to a lesser degree --are not joining the insurgency...IF  Putin only gets control of  a small part of eastern Ukraine, then he has suffered a major defeat.   NATO bases and nuclear weapons in the rest of Ukraine would be about 300 miles from Moscow and many of Russia's nuclear ICBMs would be within striking distance of US F35 stealth fighters.   That includes the  Russian ICBMs  that had been thought invulnerable to US attack.","Clarification:  Ukraine bases would allow US F35 stealth fighters (and RQ 180 stealth drones) to locate, track and destroy the Mobile Russian ICBMs that had been thought invulnerable to attack from the US (because they have no fixed known location that can be targeted by submarine or Minuteman ICBMs.)..It is astonishing that  US Newspapers have made no mention of US attempts to add Ukraine to NATO and the deadly threat that would pose to Russia..And how many Americans could die if Putin feels he is being trapped and set up for destruction.",,,,,,,,
David Cache,,,,"It's really more inertia than gravity and Putin is just hitching a ride to stoke popularity at home. The gravity of the situation is that many wars have been fought over these same claims of sovereignty...The clarity that this column brings to the situation in Ukraine and Europe as a whole is very good. The historical relevance of Poland, Slovakia, Hungry and Romania in that context can't be removed from the economics.  Which of are tied up with fossil fuels, climate change and the need for massive amounts of power to leverage Moore's law. More important than climate change to the people in Ukraine, Poland and others is territorial integrity and the bonds of kinship, to which Putin is really playing for his base at home which he needs to remain in control of his Oligarchy...History has made the people's of this region the currency for payment of global debts throughout recorded history. Like the middle east the territory has been traded back and forth despite the indigenous populations. Often the people have been slaughtered as one ruler after another lays claim. Let's prevent that this time by playing our much stronger hand carefully...Or, we could go rogue, as Putin is the Tea Party Republican's leader of the free world, a la Matt Drudge. He doesn't believe in science although he's encouraging Crimean's to open Air BnBs to attract tourism.","This column is really meaningful on many levels. No mention of the childishness of Arabs and no mention of Air B&amp;B alone make it instantly more relevant than many. ..Even so, the main arguments stay to closely heeled to mainstays and catch phrases of popular media. There are of course more than three faces to any real leader working to maintain the operations of a diverse nation spread across a huge territory. ..That Putin too has many faces and has to deal with costs and human concerns is important. Crimea has a long history and many Russians dying to defend its territorial integrity can't be easily overlooked. ..Diplomacy is the only way go. The contrasting of the many faces of President Obama and singular face of Putin that one can see in most of the US press could be a an interesting study. ..I have little box of mints with a picture Sarah Palin on it - it's labeled Sarah's Embarrassments. Of course I wouldn't even have if it weren't for McCain's fatal embarrassment when he named her as running mate. Did he embarrass himself with the same hawkish shenanigans over Georgia when GWB was prez?","It is largely our actions that set the stage upon which we now stand. As the curtain rises darkness settles in for a long winters night to crush the Ukrainian Spring. The ouster of corruption cannot be left alone to endure the tyranny of even make-believe fascists telegraphed in by Putin.What if he called them Islamofascist,would we blink...It seems not only the Republican Tea Party know how to use the ploys of Soviet style propaganda. Where is the glorified social media and Internet that replaced the trade unionists in the western press, to launch the Arab Spring. We could hold Egypt up to Putin as a shining example of how reform works without the need for military intervention.

Winter is almost over but the Europeans still want the gas. Putin has shut off gas delivery before and would  surely do so in this case. Don't count on much push-back from Europe..Europe may want to rethink its energy policy to eliminate Russian blackmail in the future. Either that or learn to speak Russian.","Yes, they should sign on with the IMF austerity plans instead--why sink slowly with Putin when you can get drowned right away with the IMF?","Well, so WHAT?  Really.  Mr. Putin scratches his ear, and we have to hear about it.  On the 4th of July, our politicians outdo themselves in patriotic fervor, making world-striding claims with abandon.  We were lately going to re-make the Middle East, remember?  And now we're going to arrange things in Ukraine, it would appear, with our hawks still unhappily slavering over the missed wars in Iran and Syria...Why should other nations be different from ours?  But then, we seem to feel outraged that any nation might do as we've done--and certainly with regard to invasions and such (not that any have matched us for bloodshed lately).  ..If you have something salient to report, then do so.

What is this, playground rules? Nation-states act in their self interest and their actions are circumscribed only by domestic political concerns and the risk-reward trade-offs of external response. The former is not a concern in Putin's Russia and the latter is not a concern under Obama' foreign policy leadership. After the feckless response to Syria crossing Obama's 'red line' re: chemical weapons is it any surprise that Obama's 'concerns' and threat of 'harsh sanctions' carry little, if any, weight with Putin? Words without action are just that, words. And words have little impact on bad actors.","George Bush may have looked into Putins eyes and seen a good soul but only because Bush admired Putin so much. Putin is, in fact, cut in the mold of Stalin, a small, clerical mind and total immorality. His background in the KGB made him the perfect criminal to cover up a crime. It cannot be allowed to happen...When leaders demand that the people responsible be brought to justice they must include Putin. If he isn't taken care of he will continue to commit crimes against humanity. He has no soul.",This sounds like typical Russian disregard for human life.

The extent of Putin's acts is not known yet; and it's absurd that some here already seem bent on invading or otherwise interfering in this distant situation ourselves.  We certainly have no claims in the area at all. And that's the message you're hearing, not hatred of America or any such thing. ..We have heard such war-mongering, past and always, from the armchair hawks, and paid such prices--there's reason to reject that now.  We have problems much more pressing.  And need no more nightmares halfway around the world.","People who suffer most under sanctions are the same people who suffer under any economic duress:  the least powerful and able to protect themselves.  And the least able to change the policies of those with power, whether in their own countries or anywhere else.  ..If the idea is to push them into misery grave enough that the poor (or the unhappy oligarchs) will storm the Kremlin like the protestors in Ukraine and take over Russia, well, that's mad.  If the idea is to cause Putin to feel bad for them and leave Crimea to the EU, that's mad, too.  If the idea is to hurt people in Russia so that people in the US or EU will feel that something is being done, I guess it would do that.  ..But the oligarchs will stay richer than Midas, and other of the wealth elite will certainly find places to park their money out of the reach of the west's sanctions.

Surely it will be very easy for international monitors to validate this report...However - the swift and immediate laying of blame at the feet of Putin and Russia by much of the corporate mainstream media, including some of the same chickenhawk militarists I remember being so eager for war in Iraq, and Syria, and Iran, is truly a thing to watch...It makes me ashamed to be an American - it as if Americans learned nothing from the yellow journalism that led us to kill 1 million Iraqis for no reason at all...Pardon me - not for no reason, but for the perceived benefit of Israel...<a hrefhttp:www.voltairenet.orgarticle178638.html titlehttp:www.voltairenet.orgarticle178638.html targetblank>http:www.voltairenet.orgarticle178638.html<a>..The neocons didn't hide the ball when it came to their strategy, you know...How much does it take to discredit these people?","Crimea was an autonomous province.

CK,,,,"Endless nonsense from this publication on this issue. Notice having no substantive facts, they must invoke the bogeyman Putin, fan a negative cult of personality...1. Let's presume Russia released Crimea, what does it do? It immediately demands to be part of Russia.  ... annexation of Crimea forced NATO and the European Union to react is the fantasy...2. Notice the bait &amp; switch: ... a new round of sanctions that could be imposed if Russian-backed separatists seized more territory ah, so now we sanction Russia for actions in a civil war! This is closer to truth but still half truth. The government in Kiev is killing Ukrainian Russian in the Donbass. Given the same situation Americans would fight too...3. Heads of Western companies are listening to Putin because he makes a ton of sense...4. When you move your weapons, nukes or not, around your own nation, that is not brandishing. Putin has been very clear that he is simply responding to the ridiculous, bribe driven buildup by the West of NATO military in places it does not belong. But here the paper is correct, this very normal response in like kind by Russia is, ... the most alarming aspect because in fact there is nothing to be alarmed about unless you invent it out of fear mongering...Putin has been measured, the West's support of power drunk puppets in Kiev alarming. Putin should remain a stalwart ally of the people of The Donbass against the quasi-fascist nationalists in Kiev...This op-ed is a farce.","This is the ultimate result of US meddling in Ukraine, and you need to ask why. Is it Putin's support for Syria? It's certainly not for lack of legitimate Russian security interests in Ukraine...Who doubts that, given the opportunity, right wing ultra nationalists like the kooks supporting Cliven Bundy in Nevada would run Barak Obama out of town (he's corrupt you know, and not even an American blah blah blah) just like has happened to an elected President in Ukraine? ..Once that sort of thing happens, all bets are off. If the people in East Ukraine want to align with Russia, they will, and there's not a damned thing anyone in the Western world can do about it. ..All of this was perfectly predictable by the right wing violence of the Maidan movement, that's the shame. Consider that had the West gotten together with Russia to solve issues in Ukraine instead of backing her into a corner, we'd have far more influence in a much more controllable situation. That our State Department is so damned stupid it allowed this to happen by supporting the coup means there are a lot of questions to be answered.","I am continually impressed by V. Putin's insight and clarity when he speaks on Western meddling around Russia's borders: ... some countries are simply taking advantage of peoples fears with regard to Russia. They just want to play the role of front-line countries that should receive some supplementary military, economic, financial or some other aid. You simply don't hear that sort of honest evaluation from American politicians, news parrots, and least of all the big fat propagandized Neocon slice of American public.","Another victim of Putin Derangement Syndrome. Btw that overextended supply line is about 75 miles long, lol.","Actually Putin is the only logical player here. People like Merkel probably tell Obama, We have to tell Poroshenko to stop his assault on the Donbass to which Obama replies, We'll tell him in private. Meanwhile people die...The military management by Putin so far is brilliant. Especially his reserve, he's let the Ukrainian Russians do their own liberation, it's remarkable, he will come out of this as a winner, a hero, smelling like a rose.","More Putin Derangement Syndrome propaganda, most likely Israel driven for the missiles to Iran. As the story states, no doubt in a bow to our stock markets; American officials say they have seen no evidence that Russia has actually begun to reposition or make ready a nuclear arsenal .... You can agitate the people with fibs, just don't agitate the money guys, right?..Only in a perverse and unnatural anti-Putin environment is approaching a spy plane a reportable offense! This story is garbage, it makes me ashamed I subscribe...The Russians should be proud they have a leader that is focused on their own nation and their brothers and sisters in the Donbass in Ukraine. For this paper's part it will sit idly while the big menace to world peace, our Congress, kills a deal with Iran.","You got that right. ..On your side; and argument constructed of facts..On the other side, Putin Derangement Syndrome.","Can we discuss the discussion? I notice that critics of Russia less often include facts about the lead-up to this crisis, or about the facts the ground, than they invoke, Putin Derangement Syndrome, whereby you call Putin names (bully, monster, oligarch) instead of addressing the issues.

Can anyone imagine what it could have been like had we had that same 'clown car' on display during the Cuban Missile Crisis??  Has anyone considered the issue of 'loose nukes' in the Ukraine?  Or the results of boxing Putin in?  This guy has already boxed himself in.  Forgotten in all the handwringing over Ukraine, is the mess he has on his hands with his Muslim base.  How many days before another terrorist attack in Sochi, Moscow, etc.?  It's not going to take long before Putin's own people start questioning which direction he has their country going in.  Obama is on the right and steady course. It's time for Joe Biden to step up and pull a Spiro Agnew and call out these 'back seat driver's'.

John S.,,,,"President Obama and President Putin should meet and discuss the critical issues of war and peace.  ..President Putin might be perceived by Americans as a tough nut to crack, but I imagine the Russians see President Obama in a similar light.  Yes, President Obama should discuss America's concerns with Russia's actions in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere, but should be ready to contest Russia's actions that threaten vital American interests.","Vladimir Putin is not right.  Putin is only looking at Syria from the perspective of what is good for him.  ..Equally, Assad is not better than the alternative. Assad is as big a terrorist as ISIS. The bottom line is there are no truly good options for Syria at this time because Syria is the battleground for the war between two major denominations of Islam, Sunni and Shi'ite...The United States, Western Europe and Russia should play a neutral role with respect to this religious conflagration in Syria.  Being neutral should not prohibit the Western Powers and Russia from working together for the benefit of the refugees forced to leave Syria.   ..Lastly, Iran and Saudi Arabia will have to be the arbiters of the religious conflict in Syria.","This does concern us. This is now a world economy, and Putin's actions will effect all of us. Less foreign investment, foreign trade will be happening in Russia, drastically effecting their economy. More gas will be exported to Europe from other countries. less technology will be developed in Russia. Eastern Ukrainian factories are inefficient. We will be dealing with a Russia in severe decline, and declining nations are very dangerous. We see already how this is effecting Russia, Putin's adventure supported by outright lies and propaganda to hide Russia's decline from it's people.","Putin is taking a leaf from our playbook---we liked the way the revolution in Ukraine turned out since it was anti-Russian and pro-western, so that was deemed legitimate. We don't like the way the vote in Crimea turned out, so that was illegitimate. Doesn't that seem to reek of self-interest, rather than principle? What is the principle that should apply to both situations? Who is articulating that? Where are the disinterested and impartial observers who will mediate this dispute? Was the revolution that unseated the former president of Ukraine democratic? I don't recall everyone in Ukraine being asked if that was okay. Why can't the U.S address the question of whether the deposing of the former prime minister of Ukraine was legitimate? That is actually at the heart of the current dispute, but of course neither the U.S. government nor its mouthpieces, the U.S. media, care to even mention that it happened. But, believe me, it made the news in Russia, and this is their response, which, it seems to me, it has to be said, is at least equally legitimate. So, again, what rules do all parties need to agree to that establish governing principles within and across international boundaries? And those rules cannot be enforced according to the self-interests of superpowers. They have to be enforced by impartial observers who take the interests of all concerned into account.",,,,,,

CA,,,,"You think there's no analogy to Munich because of some differing diplomatic details and an assertion that Putin doesn't meet an unspecified criteria for Hitlerdom?  This is handwaving at its finest...Setting aside whether or not this agreement is tantamount to Munich (it actually does too little to even be compared), there are many troubling parallels to 1938.  A formerly great power, after years of perceived humiliation, seeks to reassert itself internationally.  Lacking the political and economic power to do so peaceful, it seeks to do it by force.  This deployment of force is characterized by duplicity and deceit, agitprop and covert operations.  It is justified in terms of historical borders and ethnic ties.  Meanwhile, a world wracked by years of depression has left many idle hands and empty stomachs desperate for a change in direction...And each time Putin lashes out at a neighbor state the world sits on its hands and believes it is the end of his expansionist aggression, even as his words strongly suggest otherwise...It remains to be seen whether or not Putin's promise to tell forces (which he claims to have no control over) to back down will amount to anything.  I am skeptical.  A few weeks ago headlines reported on The Crimean Crisis now John Kerry states We did not come here to talk about Crimea.  This, to me, seems extremely telling.  Putin is able to move the goal posts.  That makes it his game, does it not?","Strange that you think that story is about casting blame.  It's about trust.  The lesson in this case is NOT Don't blame Putin for being Putin.  It's Don't trust Putin when he makes promises that contradict his character...We should absolutely blame Putin for his aggression, but that doesn't mean we should also be surprised by it.","Not quite.  These pro-Donetsk people are quite open about their intent to join Russia.  Yes, they intend to hold a referendum, but they seem to consider its results a foregone conclusion.  They've also asked Russia to invade if the Ukrainian government attempts to interfere with them...Considering all of this and the fact of Russian agitprop and covert military activities on the ground (which are no longer in serious doubt), it's not so simplistic to consider Putin's role one of central importance.  Consider also that this situation is conceivably the precise intent of Putin's strategy: foment and facilitate popular unrest such that Russia can later claim (with some truth) to have no direct control over the situation which, therefore, must demand stabilization via Russian military intervention...There's a question here of whether or not we'd have seen such a rapid escalation of this situation without Russia fueling the fire.  That seems unlikely, but, in any case, it's unknowable.  What we do know is that Russia has done everything it can to make things worse.  We needn't demean eastern Ukrainians to acknowledge that.","To be fair, the Russians have not initiate an aggressive move, but only sought to protect its naval base...Okay, in absolute terms, Crimea is roughly the size of Massachusetts.  Proportional to the contiguous United States, it is the roughly equivalent area of New Mexico.  ..If Mexico, for instance, seized control of New Mexico by force on the premise that we permit them to lease some land there which needs protecting since they don't like what's going on in D.C., would you not consider that an aggressive move?  I certainly would...If wresting control of an area by force doesn't meet your definition of aggression then I'm extremely curious to hear what that definition might be...Oh, but somehow American conservatives are to blame for the actions of Vladimir Putin?  The implicit arrogance of such a statement is too absurd for words.  The world does not actually revolve around U.S., my friend.  Let Putin take credit for his own crimes.",according to RT..Haha.  Seriously?  Putin's news service denies Putin is doing anything untoward.  What a surprise!,"The Budapest Memorandum obviously doesn't commit the US or UK to the use of force, but it does provide a context in which the US and UK will almost certainly have to commit to very strict sanctions for a very long time in order to preserve retain credibility for future disarmament treaties with other nations (consider Iran), and the EU now appears likely to come along for their own reasons.  Putin can threaten to turn off the gas taps, but, given the stakes, that may well be a bullet Europe is willing to bite.  There's even a possibility the ensuing economic shock could finally shake the EU out of its perpetually wrongheaded austerity fervor could produce net economic growth as the ECB and Germany are finally forced to provide and permit the sort of fiscal and monetary stimulus European economies have desperately needed since the global financial crisis...Will NATO stop Russia from taking Ukraine by force?  Almost certainly not.  But the price Russia will pay economically and politically for Ukraine or even just Crimea will be extremely high...Putin is in great danger of badly overplaying his hand which may not even be as strong as most people presume in the first place.",,,,

Unfortunately, after we hit Russia itself there WILL be a counter strike by Russia.  There is no way Putin is going to pull back in humiliation and let the Ukraine become a USNATO satellite.

I would argue his despotic rule degraded the state like never before. A bunch of corrupted oligarchs and KGB friends took possession of the poor Russian state as if it was their private property and it is all ok as long as they obey to Putin. In this light everything Putin is doing and proclaiming appears totally cynical.,"I just want to scream - how stupid is that.  Putin has conducted himself with amazing restraint throughout, and all he gets is Cold War style vilification by the media and escalating provocation by the US.  It seems that US foreign policy is such an utter failure and fiasco that our leaders only option is create scapegoats and eventually a war.  Can it get any worse?","The bias of the NYT with regard to Russia, in this context in particular, is so bad it amounts to blatantly negative and false statements - from this article: ... Mr. Putin seized Crimea in March.  Crimeans voted massively and indisputably in favor of cessation and annexation.  No matter how you spin it, Putin did not seize Crimea - solemn declarations from the West notwithstanding.  Wars are justified by this type of provocatively biased and false reporting.","It seems it took political will on the part of Putin to break the Western approach to conflict - winning everything at any cost.  The West wants to influence and incorporate the Ukraine into a hegemonic block, and somehow this is permissible, but Russia seeking influence in a key border state is somehow illegitimate and must be resisted with military force.  It seems the West needs a strong counter power to prevent it from using its economic and military might to isolate and defeat any country or group that wants to go a different way.  This is why Hamas is needed - to put some pressure on the West in its unilateral support of Israel and its never ending annexation of Palestinian land and violations of international law.  As long as the West does not face credible resistance, it seems willing to impose its will in any conflict anywhere in the world.  We don't need to recount the havoc this high handed approach has caused - Iraq and Israel prime active examples.  The Western account of the conflict in Ukraine, much like the conflict between Israel and Palestine, and like the facts trotted out to support the invasion of Iraq, are biased, often false, incomplete and intentionally provocative.  One only needs to review the UN report of almost a million Ukrainians fleeing to Russia and the actions of Kiev to dominate Eastern Ukraine to understand that the West's version of the facts is incomplete, biased and provocative.  Enough.","Putin didn't invade Ukraine, but probably supplied the separatists with weapons because the US pushed its influence right up to their borders and keeps telling Russia we're coming for you, you backwards barbarians..The US overextended itself and Russia is doing what it needs to buffer it's borders.  If you think the US is right to extend its influence everywhere than I suppose it's easy to see Putin as the bad guy.  However, Putin didn't topple the Ukrainian government or vote Crimea back to Russia or start that revolution in the East.  He just took advantage of the circumstances.","It's a shame that Professor Shaffer is either misinformed on the topic she is expressing a published opinion on or worse yet - is willingly spreading false information for an agenda. Either way this is not something I expect from somebody who presents herself as a respectable scholar. Isn't there repercussions for scholarly dishonesty? ..The latest violence preceded a summit meeting on Aug. 10 in Sochi, Russia, at which Mr. Putin sought an agreement on deploying additional Russian peacekeepers between Armenia and Azerbaijan. On July 31, Armenians began a coordinated, surprise attack in three locations. Azerbaijans president, Ilham H. Aliyev, and defense minister were outside their country during the attack and Mr. Aliyev had not yet agreed to attend the summit meeting. But the Armenian president, Serzh A. Sargsyan, had agreed to; its unlikely that his military would have initiated such a provocation without coordinating with Russia...It is either misguided ignorance or an outright lie by the writer to state that the summit was planned beforehand. It was an emergency meeting arranged following the flare-up in violence. Aliyev or Sargsyan could have neither denied nor agreed to attend a summit that was not even planned at the time. The only true point is that it was President Sargsyan who first agreed to the meeting, while it took Aliyev several days to realize that friction on the conflict line was backfiring, so he too later agreed. ..continued in next comment",Russia's behavior is a clear case of how loss-aversion can affect military and political decision-making.

Evgeny,,,,I sincerely hope replacing Putin would suffice - I don't want to live through another cold war.,"Let's face it, the USEU can't stop Putin with the cautious limited sanctions  imposed so far and are incapable of inflicting enough pain for it to matter because Putin's threshold for pain is way higher. Nor is the West willing to offer any meaningful support to Ukraine (and the only meaningful support in a war is arms or hands). On the other hand, the West can't concede openly either, so it will concede de facto when Putin's troops will eliminate Ukrainian offensive (which, judging from the latest news has already happened) - after which Putin will dictate whatever terms he want to Ukraine (de facto independence of the Eastern Ukraine)..The irony is that the west can't even call out the facts for what they are (Russia waging war with Ukraine, which started in Crimea! and not with the recent escalation of invasion)..And after Putin will force de facto independence, the West will lose it's ability to ratchet up sanctions (since there will be no more open conflict to justify it)..So unfortunatley Putin seems to have achieved his goal, albeit at a high cost - but hey, it's not like he foots the bill himself, he has 140 happy minions to do that for him.",,,,,,,,

G. Sears,,,,"Putin continues to flex his muscle in Ukraine despite the obvious impacts of sanctions and the Rubles sharp decline. The tighter the corner Putin gets pushed into the more likely the increased use of the Russian military as a response...Annexing Crimea played well in Russia as does continued intervention in Ukraine...Pumping up Kievs military may be the worst play by America, further inflaming an expanded proxy conflict that will bring much greater carnage and no resolution. Direct military intervention by NATO will mostly certainly trigger a full blown war...Talk about expanded sanctions is cheap and ineffective. Europe needs to lead the way to double down on the economic costs to Putin and the reigning Russian oligarchy.","Absent a scathing regiment of economic sanctions to include major trade embargoes against Russia, the West (essentially the US &amp; EU) have already missed the opportunity to prevent the now certain annexation of Crimea. ..While the West has resorted primarily to blustery condemnation and restrained wrist slapping, Putin has acted with unmitigated force and expediency. At no turn was he effectively disarmed by the indignant outcries and threats from Brussels, Berlin,  or Washington......there is some evidence that Russians are anxiously pulling tens of billions of dollars out of American accounts. Nearly 105 billion was shifted out of Treasury custodial accounts by foreign central banks or other institutions in the week that ended last Wednesday, more than three times that of any other recent week...This quote makes it evident that Western indecision and temerity has already taken some of the bite out of potential sanctions by leaving the door open for Russians to rapidly and freely recover at risk assets in the west...Crimea has made a choice. It was a foregone conclusion given its history, the number of ethnic russians comprising its citizenry, and the Russian military presence over-watching Sundays referendum. The cogent issue now is the fate of the Ukraine!","An effective stalemate that puts the Ukraine in a chaotic limbo absent Russian overt intervention. Certainly Check. Most likely Checkmate. Most interesting is this observation in this article that goes to the essence of what Putin has craftily achieved:..For Mr. Putin, the disruption ensures that Ukraine cannot firmly join the West by becoming a member of NATO or the European Union. That would comport with his strategy in Georgia and Moldova, where Russian troops occupy small sections of the country, with Moscow leaving the status of the enclaves up in the air, neither leaving nor claiming them as Russian territory...There is no apparent effective countermove that would provide a clear impetus to break this standoff. Given the extensive intertwining of the Russian and EU economies sanctions sufficient to cause Putin to retreat are elementally untenable for the West...No credible Ukraine central governance coupled with wide-spread and unchecked insurrection and no meaningful outside aid (economic or otherwise) will actually be forthcoming.","Virtually every concrete action the senator recommends has already been set in motion by President Obama in aggressive consultation with the EU and other allies. The cogent matter becomes one of whether there will be the sustained resolve to sufficiently sanction Putin's brash grab for Crimea, especially on the part of the an EU significantly dependent on the supply Russian energy commodities.  ..As for America discarding commitment to success in Iraq and Afghanistan, this hardly came as any surprise after ten plus years of extraordinary miscalculations and the outright mismanagement of two unnecessary excursions into quixotic efforts at exporting US style democracy through deeply flawed nation building. Mr. McCain would find virtually no domestic support for another ten years of the same kind of futile neocon inspired effort.   ..Setting up some grand, Cold-War-like confrontation will not serve America well, nor will it result in a transformation of Russia's domestic, regional or international demeanor -- that will, as it did before, come from within. That said, Putin's credibility as a trust worthy partner has been destroyed, he should be treated accordingly.","Telling Putin that further encroachment of Ukraines sovereignty will trigger even more severe (as yet unspecified) sanctions leaves it to Putin to imagine what might be forthcoming should he act on his bellicose impulses...That lack of specificity might be the best option, but only if the first round western response to the annexation of Crimea had been a blistering economic blow to Russia. It is hardly clear that the impact has been nearly severe enough. ..Essentially the West has accepted the first Russian territorial grab with only a modest push back. This was driven primarily by the European hope that Russia will moderate and thereby not resort to aggressively playing the energy squeeze and trade succession cards they obviously hold...Rather than warning Putin off from further incursions with essentially vague threats, it would be more credible to demand their concrete actions to clearly act to deescalate the situation vis a vis ending the overt posturing of substantial Russian forces on Ukraines borders and credible efforts discourage internal ethnic Russian dissent against the government in Kiev. Achieving this Kremlin shift from overt instigator to proactive moderator is likely to be the only workable path to avoiding the rupture of Ukraine as a viable state.",,,,,

Russian appears to be playing a smarter long game here.  By doing only what's necessary to ensure their proxies succeed in carving out what will ultimately result in an independent 'New Russia' to their west, they arguably achieve far more than by just annexation. Russia striving to surround itself with puppet states is not exactly a new concept.  The predictable next step of course would be recognition by Russia (&amp; anyone else with a gripe against the West), followed by a new Russia Pact necessary to defend New Russia against NATO.  In the end Putin achieves more by building more Russias than one bigger one.","Putin is a canny and calculating leader, but one thing for certain is that he isn't crazy.

Grossness54,,,,"Muddled' may be the word here, but muddling through is vastly preferable to open warfare. Then again, while I'm no fan of Putin's heavy-handed tactics, the West's treatment of post-Soviet Russia, if even halfway imposed on Washington, would have resulted in heads rolling down Capitol Hill. (Try - as a condition for being granted loans from the International Monetary Fund - being forced to dismantle whatever was left of a social safety net, not to mention allowing a winner-take-all investment situation that our 'Robber Barons' of a century ago could only have envied - and you'll understand what I mean. While Russia's trials, complete with enough inflation to wipe out people's savings, weren't as bad as what was done to Germany under the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I (and set the stage for Act II), they were bad enough to put the lie to the idea that the 'enlightened' West no longer punishes ordinary citizens for the failed misdeeds of their former, UNelected rulers. Having Eastern Europe rushing into NATO was disconcerting enough, but the spectre of a Ukraine destabilised and slouching in that same direction was too much to bear, especially thanks to that first of Nikita 'Cuban Missile Crisis' Khrushchev's great blunders that stuck Crimea - where Russia's Navy had (and still has) its only reliable frostproof base - onto his native Ukraine. Take a good look at the map and the history of the region, and it's no mystery why Russians feel a need for a buffer.","There should be a big emphasis place on the role of the Red Cross - not any government - in making sure that what's billed as 'humanitarian aid' is just that, and only that. I'm not sure who's less trustworthy in this dog's dinner of a situation - Putin &amp; Co, or the Ukrainian government? Then again, governments in general - ours included - have lately been about as honest with their citizenry as I've had to shovel snow in my neck of the woods.","So Putin is a 'sphere of influence thinker'. Find me a leader of a major nation, in the history of this rock, who hasn't thought that way and I'll show you one who ended up sulking off in utter defeat - if he or she was fortunate enough to be still physically able to sulk. Or breathe..What we're dealing with is a Russian nationalist, at a time when Western leaders are afraid to even be perceived as being first and foremost concerned with their own countries. 'Political incorrectness', or something. Considering the 'multicultural' hash being made of western Europe, it's starting to look more like cultural suicide. Meanwhile, even Russians who aren't too thrilled with a lot of Putin policies support him because he's pushing his own country's agenda, and anyone who knows anything about Russia knows that this bear's no cute little cub, and is certainly in a position to demand respect. Whether Putin's playing chess is immaterial. The real problem here in the West is that too many of our leaders - including here at home - have been acting as if they've lost THEIR marbles.",,,,,,,

It's actually a friendly gesture, aimed at making Putin think twice about putting his metaphorical wee-wee in another meat grinder.",,,,,,,,,
Barbara,,,,"The downing of a civilian aircraft is wildly irresponsible, and I hold the separatists and Putin responsible.  However, I saw yesterday on a television report that some Ukrainians in the area were walking through the debris and placing branches and wooden sticks with strips of fabric to mark the location of remains, which is probably the most they could do.  Today, Al Jazeera video today showed locals carrying body bags from the crash site to road sides, and local women constructing a makeshift memorial adorning it with bouquets of wildflowers.  Although higher ups in eastern Ukraine and Russia are behaving horribly, it appears that some average people are doing what they can to show respect and consideration to the dead and their families and friends.  These people should be commended for their actions.","Yes, the Crimea has warm water ports, but there are other warm water ports on the Russian Black Sea coast east of Crimea...At one point, Russia's plan was to expand those ports and gradually move out of Crimea...That 50 billion or so that Putin spent on Sochi might have been better spent on expanding and improving those Russian Black Sea ports.","@ Craig Avery.  Mr. Putin may very well out-tough Obama, but can he out-tough Angela Merkel?  She knows him and Russia best, and she appears to be very unhappy with Putin at this point.  It appears that at this point, she is the one who will make the tough decisions, not Obama.","It seems obvious that Putin's strategic skills were honed in a closed system that blunted the consequences for failure by controlling the media and democratic institutions.  How can you deny that you are arming the rebels, on the one hand, and then blame civilian airlines for flying in a sky over the same territory that you just insisted is not being militarized through Russian arms, on the other?  Or maybe it's Ukraine's fault for defending itself against well-armed (by Russia) rebels.  There is no reason to believe anything Putin says, whatever it is.","Many argue that the USSR's debacle in Afghanistan was a major cause of its demise.

Stolypin,,,,"This situation was not created by Moscow, Putin or, indeed, the pro-separatists in eastern Ukraine. The US and EU, of course, insist that this is all you need to know and the western media has launched a propaganda campaign that presents such a distorted narrative that many people I speak to are totally unaware that the ruthless, murderous, child-eating dictator, Yanukovich, and his government were actually elected by the people of Ukraine.in 2010 and 2012. (No, this must be concealed or, at least, ignored because the thrust of the sanitised story is that it is the interim government, chosen by the rightist mob in Kiev, that represents the democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people!)  What we have, once again, (remember Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, etc,) is the west interfering in another country and producing chaos. In Kiev, the west supported and assisted the destruction of the democratic structures and the overthrow of the elected president of Ukraine. The effect of this has been to destroy the political consensus which held this diverse country together. Before the Kiev Coup things were not perfect but the political system was working and there was no major thrust for separate statehood or joining the Russian federation. Now western politicians and their media acolytes have the gall to point the finger at Putin and Russia. The really sad thing is, I doubt that the damage can be undone but as far as the west is concerned, we should get out and stay out.","What do you expect to happen when there is a coup against the democratically elected president and government These are areas of the country where between 75 and 95 of the people voted for Yanukovich and the All Regions Party in the 2010 and 2012 respectively. One doesnt have to look to Moscow or Putin to explain this situation, it an entirely predictable outcome of the events in Kiev a couple of months ago which effectively deprived most of the citizens in eastern Ukraine of their vote. They now, not without reason, feel aggrieved at having unelected and unrepresentative rulers imposed upon them  wouldnt you?","I wonder how many of these commentators would react if Russia were to launch a huge air war against the Ukraine in the west dropping about 15,000 bombs and 2,000 missiles. If the results of this bombing were the death of over 2000 citizens with thousands more seriously wounded. The hundreds of targets of this bombing including schools, hospitals and places of great cultural and historical importance: all this in support of a secessionist movement and in no way authorised by the UN..This is precisely what the US with their NATO partners did in Serbia in 1999  so lets cut the Russophobic hypocritical nonsense and look for a way to peace rather than just demonising Putin and Russia.","Putin does not 'jail his enemies' any more than Obama or Cameron does. One of his greatest enemies is Marsha Gessen: she wrote the enthusiastic attack on him 'the Man Without a Face'; she writes regular articles attacking him in the NYT, New Statesman, Vanity Fair, et al; and she is dragged out for appearances on talk shows when they want someone who will put the boots into Putin..She lives freely in Moscow as a dual RussianAmerican citizen and has never, as far as I know, seen the inside of a jail, in Moscow or elsewhere.","Really! The figures on Putin's economic success do not come from Russia, they come from the esteemed Forbes Business Magazine (founded in New York 1917). The other figures are freely available form a variety of western sources on the internet. Don't be lazy: find out for yourself rather than relying on prejudice, gut instinct and western propaganda.

Let's not try to read the future from the tea leaves.","Eastern and Central Europe is the proper place to store large weapons like tanks. This equipment is useless in the fight against terrorists but it may deter the Russians...Cold War II seems to be upon us. Mutual Assured Destruction prevented Cold War I from becoming a hot war and, hopefully, will continue to do so. Putin is very nasty guy but a rational guy. He talks about 'nuclear war' but means probably a use of tactical rather than strategic (thermonuclear) weapons...Amazing comments here from real 'peacenics'.","Crimea belonged to many different folks over the millennia but for the past hundreds of years had been part of Russia...And it is now again. Nothing anyone can do about it...Hopefully, that part of Russia will pay for the deliveries of basic goods from Ukraine NOT forcing Putin to annex more of traditional Ukraine...I hope that people with access to power in Russia are aware of the one hundred anniversary of WWI started by a Serbian teenager.

Putin does - in that sense Russia is still a superpower. And he is talking about them very casually...Friedman mentions only former Soviet Republics as possible targets of Russia's expansion. As someone born in Czechoslovakia I hope that Putin has no plans to dominate my native country.","Russia will NEVER admit any mistake under Putin. That is, not officially.

Carolyn,,,,"Although this news is unsettling, when I think of all the shenanigans the U.S. has been involved in with regard to CIA infiltrations into foreign countries in order to destabilize, it's hard to frame Putin as the bad guy.   We certainly did our share of influence peddling in Cuba, and remember Iran-Contra?  I'm certainly not excusing Putin, but again, he's being targeted for doing what many leaders authorize, and it feels disingenuous to highlight him.  I so wish the U.S. and its allies were more forthcoming in their meddling or better yet, stop it.","I have great respect for Putin despite all the western propaganda trying to cast him as an enemy of democracy, and a wily, unsavory character when he is not any of those things.  He has consistently supported Assad because he's right: every ME nation that has suffered the overthrow of established governments has turned into a quagmire of poverty, chaos, fear and violence.  And if I had to speculate, I would say that certain western interests involved in the toppling of Middle Eastern established governments did so in with the objective of crippling those countries both socially and militarily through dysfunction and poverty.  The objective was to make a more pliable, grateful atmosphere for western oil interests and Israeli domination. It's impossible not to notice how the declared Middle Eastern enemies of the west are always countries with governments that won't kowtow to western interests or Israeli demands...Assad in not our enemy.  Syria was a civilized country with a functioning, educated population until the U.S. undermined his regime.  Iraq, Yemen and Libya were stable countries until the west interfered both militarily and by fomenting rebellion, probably through the CIA.  Regardless, I think that President Obama is starting to realize the value of being a more honest broker on global affairs, and rejecting selfish and often evil militant interests.  Given the alarm in the rise of ISIS, it's time to work with Russia as equals for the sake of peace and sanity.",". . .  some officials in the White House and the State Department worry that a meeting in New York would embolden Mr. Putin, in effect restoring his stature as a major world player on one of the biggest stages...I'd like to know who the officials are that think that Mr. Putin is not a major world player. He's the leader of a super power and has been in the lime light for years. He's also right about supporting Syria's current regime, as he was right about removing chemical weapons in Syria and about protecting Edward Snowden as well as cooperating with the Iranian negotiations. Obama should meet with him because not only IS he a major world player - to try to portray him otherwise is dishonest -  but Putin has demonstrated what we here at home seem to be lacking in our officials which is an honest appraisal and forthright problem solving.  With a collaborative effort, America and Russia could drive ISIS out and bring stability to the region which in turn would remove a heavy burden from Europe.","Alas, Hitler and Chamberlain are brought up yet again as a reason to make war, not peace.  Well, do I get to bring up Vietnam, then?  Because I just saw a little trinket made in Vietnam right here in the U.S., and I haven't heard a word about China - the great red menace - mowing over the rest of Asia since we pulled out of Vietnam.  And that's been a long time.  ..So, how come Putin gets to be Hitler??  Because all our militant paranoids are anxious for a little excitement in their otherwise humdrum peaceful lives??  Well, sorry, militants.  No more money for the bloated militaryindustrial complex.  No WWIII.  Chamberlain is long gone, and so is Hitler.  All that's left is climate change and superbugs.  Granted, those are a little more intimidating, but actually worth the fight.","It is very difficult now to reverse the administration's  deriding of Russia's annexation of Crimea, albeit Crimea is essentially Russian. Don't the people of Crimea get a say, or is America really as imperialistic as our adversaries claim?  The only dignified course for the US now is to accept the current situation and allow Putin to give us yet another out, which no doubt he will, by conceding something superficial so that the current administration can brag about how the sanctions worked, just as it did in Syria.  ..We need adults in government, not the immature braggadocios that we have now, shooting from the hip, unapologetically spying on their own citizens, and not making a significant improvement in the economy for the majority.  We are no longer a nave citizenry that believes the post WWII mentality that we are the masters of all.  We know we are not.  We know we have leadership capable of deceit and selfishness.  As if it wasn't made clear enough in Vietnam, we now have Iraq and Afghanistan to add to the list.  We know that our government meddles where it shouldn't and is perceived as a hypocritical entity, ignoring human rights and secretly exploiting international unrest. But our government is not representative of the American people.  We the people don't want to spy on each other and we do want harmony.  We know our government should leave Crimea alone.  Hence, we the people are in the process of seeking better leadership alternatives.","Sadly and shamefully, Putin may be the only foreign, demonstrable backbone that can stand against Israeli militants and U.S. militants in our own government, as they have united, beating the war drum and spitting on diplomacy.  Ironically - and allegedly just like Putin - theirs is the agenda of expansionist wars.   So in a very odd way - despite their animosity - Obama and Putin share a resistance, albeit for very different reasons.  ..As long as Edward Snowden has been barred for coming home a free man, and western allies, despite his global contribution, are too cowardly to shelter him, we are in no position to criticize Putin.  He is the only man with the means and courage to keep an American hero from harm.  That should speak volumes about Putin.  Unfortunately, we need him.","Asking Putin to control his minions is not realistic because they are not his minions, by the Editorial Board's own admission.  The separatists are their own party.  They ignored Pujtin's request for election postponement.    The way forward is not to threaten Russia.  The way forward is to engage Russia, the government of Ukraine,  and find a credible representative for the separatists that - with the help of Germany - can hammer out a solution, which will probably entail a certain autonomy for a those Ukrainians who want a closer tie with Russia.  Otherwise, there will be bloodshed.  The U.S. should  not be involved, since apparently, our policy is to threaten and punish instead of constructively engage the parties involved.  Germany is well suited to the task of bridging the differences and stabilizing the region.  Threats only entrench leaders and provoke mistrust and hostility.","I think Mr. Putin is a savvy world leader, and in all probability, is following the course he had intended.  He will not give up Crimea, but he will throw the West a bone, which has done in the past.   I have little doubt that he expected an uproar, but he had to cement his hold on Crimea before appearing  conciliatory...I think it's important to note that for all the West's posturing and Obama's condemnations of Putin moving the goal posts and forcibly altering national borders, the United States unilaterally supports a nation that does just that despite the absence of any ethical or legal right.  That nation is Israel.  The West - particularly America - has lost the most important war of all.  Putting aside Afghanistan, Vietnam and Iraq, we have lost the war of credibility, and without credibility, we have neither trust nor respect.  Our words are meaningless..If we want earnest dialog and fair play, we in the U.S. must resolve to elect officials that are ethical and are willing to shape foreign policy predicated on consistent standards of moral conduct, not just the way lobbyists and special interests sway them. I think Crimea has been a good lesson for America.  Despite our bluster, we are witnessing the fall-out of our own immaturity and hypocrisy vis a vis a foreign policy predicated on might makes right.  We may find it appalling that another nation is reflecting our mantra, but it is forcing a certain introspection which -  in the long run - is a good thing.","It's fascinating.  Simply substitute Ukraine for Iraq or Afghanistan or Libya, and Putin suddenly sounds exactly like George W. Bush or Obama. ..I think we need to finally embrace the end of our innocence.  There are no more good guys and bad guys, there are simply human beings.  We can try to analyze Putin, second guess his motives, turn him into a Darth Vader for the sake of excitement and sanctimonious condemnation, but it doesn't elevate us into righteous warriors.  It just makes us sound petty and immature, hypocritical and aggressive. The article, needless to say, is informative but biased. ..We need a level head, and I think we have it in Merkel.  The United States is controlled by military zealots, to which even Obama seems vulnerable, hence all the bluster.  Senator McCain, aka Mr. Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran has decided that our foreign policy is feckless because we don't unleash the military over every last slight or upheaval.   I'm relieved that Europe is a bit more patient and less vitriolic when it comes to Russia and particularly Putin.  But then, Europe is not dominated by companies and institutions that profit by military conflict.","United States hypocrisy is in its most dangerous form.  The U.S. government believes that it can invade anybody at any time, and somehow it's righteous.  It's not, of course.  But when Russia hints at voluntary troops, American officials start with that self-righteous pitch about all the harm it could do. On the other hand, it's O.K. for the U.S. to turn a blind eye to all the mercenaries and volunteers aiding and abetting the Syrian resistance otherwise known as terrorists andor people who hate secularism.  Regardless, the Russians are going to fix the Syrian problem, and short of declaring war, there's nothing the United States or the rest of our phony allies like Turkey can do about it.  If it were up to the United States, we would use the Kurds to fight ISIS, then betray them to Turkey, where they would be no doubt annihilated.  That's American foreign policy: backstab, lie and betray, just as the U.S. government did to Gaddafi and just as it did to its own citizens.  If there's money to be made and power to grab, come up with some moral excuse - no matter how outrageous - churn out the propaganda, and shed that blood. .. The last great president was Eisenhower. Since then, it's been a steady decline.  Now all we have are egotists trying to bend the truth.  Russia is at least consistent in terms of supporting allies, and Syria must be settled.  At this moment in time, average citizens in Europe and the U.S. should realize that Putin is their greatest ally."

Would anyone now be shocked if a Republic of East Ukraine or something similar comes into being--and then asks for Russian military and other assistance.  This would be followed, no doubt, by a request to join the Russian federation.","Peter the Great would be the first to put a bullet into Putin's head, for destroying the perception of Russia that Peter achieved...The more interesting and may be more relevant question might be who would Solzhenitsyn have sided with?","The EU is concerned with its own survival right now and some member states are getting loose (UK)...The EU's future is endangered by the growing strength of nationalist parties in much of Europe.

Steve Singer,,,,"It's not a western defeat. It's not a defeat at all. The West isn't at war there. The last Western army to fight there was the Wehrmacht...The political problem must be framed in a different context. Ukraine has no history of successful self-government. With brief, occasional interludes it has been a province in a neighboring state: the Lithuanian Confederation, Czarist Russia, Soviet Union. Want to know how Brezhnev's Soviet Union ran under the hood? You need look no further than Yulia Tymoshenko's governments. Like Moldova -- and Russia, and Greece -- Ukraine was a piggybank and plaything of oligarchs, mafias and dictators; and still is...It matters. Ukrainians now confront a slow-motion putsch. Putin paralyzes Kiev like a cobra, using violence, bluff, threat, bluster and subterfuge; relying on the latter to foster political corruption to enfeeble Ukraine's economy and finish the wrecking job started, through proxies, in Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts. We can do nothing about any of this, nor can we challenge it directly, because Ukraine is not a vital national interest for us...The only regional power that can counter Putin's Putsch is the Ukrainian nation itself -- the 35-million Ukrainians west of the Dnieper River; and the Balts. Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Finns, Swedes, Danes, Norwegians -- and, especially, Poles. What happens in Ukraine, and to it, is of vital importance to them all but Poles especially because the invasion route to Warsaw goes through Kiev.","Want to know how Brezhnev's Soviet Union ran under the hood?

Rather, it's that similar protests against him and his regime by ordinary Russians in Red Square -- against his personal corruption, his lawlessness, his regime's repressiveness and the cult of personality he's built around himself, all acts of pure self-aggrandizement -- might lead to his overthrow...Putin defends his person, vast stolen wealth and paramount political position in Russia itself by destroying a democratic uncorrupt independent Ukraine.","Putin pushes against the only door barring the way to a bottomless pit...Europe is prostrate, disorganized politically and psychologically by faltering economies, the Ukraine war, Greece's economic implosion and the onslaught of war-front refugees...Meanwhile, our war against Wahhabi Salafism forced upon us by Bin Laden goes badly. Our military lacks realistic metrics to quantify success in a conflict waged without territorial objectives or American ground forces. It's forced to rely on proxy armies that are scarcely more than ill-trained militias, surrounded by enemies. But this isn't why it fumbles. Our fundamental problem is strategic. How to confront a popular insurrection by tens of millions of impoverished people against corrupt dictatorships that benefit a wealthy few. The Mubaraks, al-Gaddafis, al-Sisis, al-Sauds and al-Assads. Once again we find ourselves on the wrong side of revolution, trapped by the dead hand of old alliances made with anciene regimes. Our inability to break with that past insures those small revolutionary struggle will evolve into an all-out war between civilizations; what Bin Laden wanted...Into this conflagration strolls Putin, seeking to turn it to his advantage but viewing it through the narrowest of prisms: irredentist Russian nationalism. He seeks to reestablish Russian hegemony in Europe, especially its near-abroad, without quite realizing that he's standing in foot-deep gasoline striking match after match trying to see his way forward.","Something else; something more: ..Putin's covert military campaign against Ukraine -- especially the Maidan Nezalezhnosti protests that led to the overthrow of his puppet Ukrainian president, Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych -- isn't based on turning aside some nascent long term strategic military threat from the west.

It would call into question the legitimacy of the political process that brought him to power and and keep him there. Mass protests against widespread corruption and repression in Russia and his personality cult could destabilize his regime and ultimately cause its overthrow...A prosperous, democratic, independent post-Soviet Ukraine would present Russians with an alternative to Putinian authoritarianism; why he is determined to prevent the emergence of any such thing.

Jack Nargundkar,,,,"As long as Putins popularity in Russia continues to poll at stratospheric levels, his belligerence will continue.  Only when the Russian people start really hurting, as they did towards the end of the Cold War, will Putins revanchist desires subside.  We have seen this movie before, with the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.   That movie had a happy ending for the west but at a great cost to the Soviet Union  it fell apart...However, Putin is well aware that NATO is not going to engage him militarily over Ukraine.  So we have no choice but to increase the cost of his aggressive behavior.  Also, given Russian history, the west needs to ensure it is ready to keep the pressure on Putin for years, not just months.  As WWIIs nearly three-year siege of Leningrad, which cost almost a million lives, proved  the Russians are a very resilient people.  ..This is not an easy problem with a short-term solution, Putin is in it for the long haul and the west needs to be committed to what might very well turn into a mini-Cold War II?  To be forewarned is to be forearmed.","This entire argument about Ukraine wanting to be more European implies that Russia is not?  Putin might consider Russia Eurasian but the fact is it is as ethnically European as the Ukraine.  The old Soviet Union was Eurasian for sure with all its bordering stan nations.  In any case, I make this point because Putin is not afraid of Ukraine wanting to adopt European values, as much as he is afraid of it messing up his near abroad buffer zone...Also, I found Mr. Friedmans conclusion, Todays oil price will be most affected by two men  King Salman and how he uses his spare capacity to produce oil and Czar Putin and how he uses his spare capacity to produce trouble so telling.  Kings, Czars and oil are destined to become relics of 20th century power and geopolitics within the next couple of decades.  Ironically, these petro-powers are desperately trying to cling on to a fading, if not diminishing, resource.  ..So we dont need NATO to stop Putin, his own hubris will do him in.  The question is whether Russia will survive his shortsighted power plays or join the Ukraine in seeking to become a more productive member of Europe and the world.","Ironically, the last time a Pope was relevant on the world stage was in 1979, when Pope John Paul II spoke out against communism and the Soviet Union.  Now, we have Pope Francis taking center stage, but he is focused on the relevancy of the Catholic Church in the 21st century to contemporary social issues. ..Maybe if the Pope included Putins treatment of gays in Russia on his radar, we might see Putin go on the defensive?  You never know, if Pope Francis continues to lead with authentic humility and reckless generosity, he might just get Putin to ease up, first on his homophobia and gradually on his kleptocratic ways.  Sometimes spiritual charisma works where political persuasion has failed?","The time to play Cuban Missile Crisis, Part Deux was in 2008, when Putin invaded Georgia and grabbed Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  Back then; President Bush was still seeing some vestiges of a soul in Putins eyes, so he chose to do nothing. ..Since then, Putin has recognized that the Great Recession has left EU economies weak and the United States war weary because of its extended commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq.  It is in this larger context that Putin has gambled on the west not getting militarily involved in the Ukraine.  If the man can shoot down a civilian airliner without compunction, he has already proven he will stop at nothing to achieve his near abroad objectives...The only language that Russia understands is the one that worked during the Cold War  containment.  The only way to change Putins cost-benefit analysis, is further tighten the screws on sanctions and squeeze Putins friends, the oligarchs, even harder.  Providing the Ukrainian Army with antitank missiles, battlefield radars, reconnaissance drones is a risky gambit, which even if it did produce the desired results, would come at a huge cost of human life and destruction of infrastructure.  Syria is a close example  and we have not even armed rebel groups there as yet!","Putin is an old KGB apparatchik, whose public words rarely ever match his actions.  He believes in a fantasy world in which he sees Russia rise once again to lead a neo-Soviet Union.  He wants what he calls the near abroad, including the Ukraine, to be a part of it, if not all of the Ukraine, at least the part that is east of the Dnieper River. Putin knows he cannot annex Eastern Ukraine like he did the Crimean peninsula, so he will continue to foment civil strife in Eastern Ukraine until it secedes. ..President Obama had just announced new stiffer sanctions on Russia on Monday.   Three days later, Russian-backed rebels in Eastern Ukraine shoot down a civilian airliner with a surface-to-air missile system that they had stolen from the Ukraine.  It all seems a little too surreal  this horrendous act should be a wake-up call for Western Europes leaders as to who the real Putin is and to what lengths he is willing to go to make his dreams come true.","A cease-fire in the Ukraine until Putin decides his near-abroad hasnt stretched out far enough and he might just want to take Kiev in two weeks after all! ..We cant come with a solution, if we dont identify the problem accurately, which is Putin is a phony and the sooner the west, especially Europe, recognizes this the better.","Innocent victims are sadly common in conflicts, but whoever unleashed a lethal missile not knowing how to distinguish between a military and a civilian plane is not only irresponsible and stupid, but a war criminal...Proving anyone is a war criminal is going to be next to impossible after the crime scene was severely compromised by Putins thugs, who did not permit access to it for almost three days, during which time they must surely have removed any traces of the Russian surface-to-air missile from amongst the wreckage area...Innocent foreign civilians who had nothing to do with the Ukraine have been brutally and senselessly killed.  Only Putin can bring peace to Ukraine in short order, so the U.S. and Europe needs to make him pay a heavy price until he agrees to do so.  This sort of punitive measure would at least ensure that those innocent souls did not die in vain.",Dictators will hang on to power even if it means ruling over a mirage. The old Soviet bosses oversaw a vast economic mirage for 70 years. Putin has lucked into an oil and gas boom that might help his mirage survive for another decade or so until another 70s style oil shock brings that Russian dream to an end. The Russian oligarchs have diversified their holdings by investing much of their wealth abroad and they help sustain Putin in power. This is why financial sanctions on Russian businessmen are key to bring about a faster change in Putins values.,"In the long run, western Chinese water torture style sanctions on Russia might prove more effective in affecting Putins values than any immediate and drastic actions  which, in fact, would prove counter-productive as Mr. Friedman suggests. Even though the west might seem to be losing the battle against the wily Putin right now, I suspect that it will eventually win the larger war  precisely because of those Putin values, which will not be able to stand the test of time, even in his own country!","Mr. Friedman writes The morning after a big event is when fools rush in and declare that someones victory or defeat in a single battle has changed everything forever. The morning after the morning after, the laws of gravity start to apply themselves..A similar thing happened to our own President George W. Bush after he invaded Iraq in 2003.  The morning after it was Mission Accomplished.  The morning after the morning after, the laws of gravity started to take hold until we finally withdrew from Iraq in 2011...A similar thing happened to USSR President Brezhnev after he invaded Afghanistan in 1979.  The morning after it was part of the new expanded Soviet empire.  The morning after the morning after, the laws of gravity started to take hold until the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989...But Putin has been emboldened because he thinks he defied gravity after invading Georgia in 2008.  Will the Crimean invasion finally help uphold a basic law of physics? Only time and the will power of the western world tell  as it did after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan."

Let me remind you that the sameness has been achieved, at least as far as the Eastern part of Ukraine is concerned, by meticulous eradication of Ukrainians by the tsarist and communist Russia to ensure total enslavement of Ukraine to usurp political dominance in the region as well as get access to the countrys rich resources. When you erase a people, you erase the memory of what its like to be different and free. That memory has not been completely eradicated in the Western Ukraine since the Soviet liberators marched into the region (which used to be part of the Austro-Hungarian empire) to protect their sphere of influence at the beginning of WWII.

For the time being the only thing they appear to have is a voice. Those who are interested in hearing the voice appear to be in the West (Western Ukraine, the US). Those who would like for Ukraine to dissolve into the abyss of illusionary Slavic brotherhood are in Russia as well as in the West. Its tough to be right in the middle of geopolitical struggles, but thats exactly where Ukraine is unfortunate enough to be. I hope it is still around 10 years from now.","I'm not sure what, if any, intervention I would support.  But the idea that we should intervene if only some opposition was pure enough makes me sick with the hypocrisy of it.  I am curious as to what level of purity is required before we will help an opposition.  The Syrian opposition remained peaceful for months and months, was mercilessly slaughtered by its government all that time, and was given no help whatsoever.  Then, when extremists had had ample time to flood in, Obama spouts nonsense about red lines and doesn't follow up anyway...Meanwhile, the Ukrainian opposition IS democratic and pluralistic, IS implementing an inclusive government, and IS seeking ties with the west, and yet you continue to write if, if, if...  I really don't think any lip service should be paid to helping foreign democratic movements when the reality is that we are only willing to help the imaginary perfect people that never come- perfectly peaceful, perfectly willing to be slaughtered, perfectly liberal in their political views, etc.  And this is not even to mention that all perfectly democratic European countries have substantial right wing parties of their own (France, Austria, etc. anyone?)  Do we support the views of such parties?  No.  Do they have a right to exist in a democracy?  Yes...Finally, Putin care nothing about how he looks in international media- the idea that he will suddenly realize that he looks ridiculous and will backtrack is laughable.",,,,,,,

Cameron has shown The UK has deep divisions with Germany. The Germans will reach the same conclusion shortly for the USA. The Germans have much more in common with the Russians and Chinese that the UK or the USA.

will,,,,"Spot on Article.  Putin's aggression must be met with swift and measured response.  Here is what makes sense from this armchair:..1) Put an International Peacekeeping force of 20-30,000 international peacekeepers all along the Minsk line.  Then force new negotiations with real teeth in them...2) If that doesn't stop this aggression from the Invaders from the East - Arm Ukraine to protect and defend itself, and cause major losses for the invaders and their proxy-mercenaries whenever they launch any offensive...3) Escalate banking and oil industry sanctions. Go Big....and go Now. Aggression must be met quickly and swiftly with harsh economic measures against the backers of this war in Ukraine, along with measured military support in the way of effective supplies and training. Drain Putin's war coffers. Not by a billion here and there...but by 10's of billions... 4) For the EU in Ukraine - it's incur this cost now - or incur a 10X cost later... 5) Send emails NOW to Merkel, Hollande, Cameron, Obama, leaders of Northern Europe - supporting the above actions. ..To underline: this should be led by EU leadership - with Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, and PM Cameron locked arm in arm, in front of all other EU leaders.  Obama, Harper, Abe, Abbott, et al, standing alongside EU leaders.  And Jens Stoltenberg taking orders from this Merkel-led alliance...As noted - this is very much a case of pay this bill now....or pay a much steeper cost in the future.","And.....so what?  I mean - what will change?  Putin's going to say - alright - ya got me..., and pull his guys out?  Or have his hamburglars take off their masks, since they've been outed?  Don't think so.  And while confirmation is nice - the weapons, professionalism, and skill in subterfuge warfare has already made it abundantly clear to the vast majority of the world that Russian military and special ops are running the show...So while this is absolutely worth reporting - I'm afraid it changes nothing.  Putin will continue to deny - and will continue wreaking havoc in Eastern and Southern Ukraine.  In fact - I suspect he will push as far as he can until NATO decides that enough is too much.  I'm no warmonger - but I believe that is whowhat we are dealing with here.","Yes - law SHOULD matter.

Without doing the math, I suspect the EU would have to move between 60-100 of it's oil and gas purchases from Russia.  And we'd have to convincecajolebribe China to also minimize it's purchases from RussiaGazprom, Inc.  It would be great if our leaders could pull that off.

But relative to the population who buy what KremlinTV is selling - the people you are referring to are a drop in the bucket.  For a few reasons: 1) the propaganda is extremely thick in Russia, and 7 x 24.  Where the Kremlin has total control - on tv, radio, and nearly all print - there is only one point of view; 2) many Russians have felt beaten down since the fall of the USSR, and before Putin.  Regardless of the (il)legality or (im)morality of his actions on the world stage - they see Putin's actions as restoring Russian power - economically, territorially, and militarily.  This makes them WANT to believe - or at least support, if not believe - Putin Propaganda; and 3) those who understand that Russian media shovels pure propaganda to the people, and don't buy into it - understand that they put their arms, legs, or lives at risk if they speak out.","Although the author paints very real possibilities here - focusing on if Ukraine is lost by the West creates Red Herringville for the Kremlin propagandists (who come out of the woodwork on Op-Eds like this....)...The real tragedy here is not geopolitical.  It's the death and destruction of homes, families, lives, and livelihoods of The People of Ukraine.  And the trampling of Ukraine's border and Ukraine's sovereignty by one Vladimir Putin...Of course, geopolitics is on full display here.  Putin's - because he doesn't want to lose yet another former Soviet Republicsatellite trying to escape Kremlin corruption and domination.  And the West's, including Poland and the Baltics - for their own sovereignty and safety, as well as economic zone reasons...But focusing on our reasons for stopping Putin's military aggressionsovereign transgressions against Ukraine diminishes what are BY FAR the most important reasons for providing lethal support to Ukraine: that a) Putin is killing Ukrainians, and destroying their cities with Russian-supplied weapons, money, and troops, and b) he is usurping the free will of the people of Ukraine: to escape Kremlin domination, and to be free to pursue their own economic and political future.","Kosovo........Huh.  I wasn't aware that Ukraine was engaged in genocideethnic cleansing that would make Putin's aggression in Ukraine in any way comparable to the West stopping Slobodan Miloevi' genocide in Kosovo, following his 200,000 ethnic murders.  Quite telling that Russia backed Miloevi right up until his resignation and arrest...There are of course differences in your other false equivalencies.  But my goodness - if you can't ascertain the difference between the West' action in Kosovo to stop a mass murderer, and Putin's invasion of Ukraine, you certainly won't be able to do so with the others.  ..The one piece of good news with your post: at least you are admitting that Putin is in fact invading Ukraine.  That's a step in the right direction for someone from Russia.",

However, President Obama and the people he represents (who are the war profiting corporations, not the voters) is very, very dangerous.  The U.S. is killing and invading in countries all over Africa and the Middle East, while letting our own country rot from neglect.  ..The average U.S. citizen is overwhelmingly at greater risk from abuse and abusers of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco products than they are from terrorists real and imagined.","Let's hope that Putin does not behave as Obama would.  If Obama were in Putin's shoes, he would be sending in drones and special ops forces already.","If Putin is stirring up trouble in the Ukraine, then what do you call our massive invasions of countries around the world, our repeated destabilization of elected governments, and our use of drones for assassinations?   Oh, wait, I know -- it is called fighting for freedom!",The common thread is that the United States wants to bully Russia in ways that we would find totally unacceptable if the situation were reversed.  Putin won't be bullied and the United States just doesn't know what to make of that except to get angry and dream of force as a solution.,"The United States has declared that they may attack anyone anywhere in the world as part of the imagined War on Terror of the Bush and Obama administrations.  And that claim has been exercised in over a half dozen countries, either via invasion or drone strikes or assassination squads.  But Putin is crucified for wanting to annex Crimea, with historical connection to Russia and without the bloodbath that follows most US actions.  I don't get it.","What credibility does the United States have to question Putin and Russia?..We've attacked and invaded Iraq and Afghanistan. We attacked Libya.  We constantly threaten Iran with attack.  We are operating killer drones in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.

Indeed, as a true existential threat?..Can anyone seriously believe that Washington did not expect Russia, at the very minimum, to deploy military forces to secure control of Crimeaa part of Russia until 1954, the home of Russias Black Sea fleet, and its sole access point into the Mediterranean?..So, then, why did Washington do it? Even if it could mean the start of a nuclear war?

Russia has a deep water port at Novorossiysk on the Black Sea a few hundred miles to the East. The Panama Canal is a vital trade route open freely for world commerce. In Panama, as with everyplace else the USA invaded in the last 150 years, we ceded control back to a local government.

Perhaps the world over there are two kinds of people to be found in relatively greater and lesser numbers in each country.  ..A. The hardliners, who seek domination over others and feel energized when there is conflict and antagonism, and they seek and celebrate the glory of war. They eschew empathy, which they view as a weakness. They feel genuinely uncomfortable with human differences and value loyalty above all--people should be and think alike, which, of course, is whatever their way of being and thinking is. ..B. Then there are those who are not looking to increase tensions but to reduce them through cooperation, peace, and sharing. They view empathy as a positive quality &amp; seek to develop it in themselves and others. They favor diplomacy, finding common ground, &amp; peaceful solutions. They are intrigued by and welcome human differences...Group A thinks Group B's are weak. Group B thinks Group A's are insecure and weak and cover up their insecurities by overcompensating and trying to act strong by seeking conflict and trouble.  ..It's all about wanting to make enemies or make friends.  Putin has decided he can deflect attention from all Russia's problems and ethnic divisions by making enemies--not unlike Dick Cheney and John McCain.  ..But I think the world is becoming too small, too populated, &amp; too heated to pursue a Group A strategy. Perhaps the next generation will elect more Group B types--I hope so.","There really are valid claims on both sides, and a diplomatic solution should be possible--or it could all be made far worse.  ..We seem to be at the posturing and political theater stage in this conflict right now, with each side jostling for center stage, staking its claim, and defending its interests. ..But, this is no Rwanda or Bosnia--yet--and I don't think either the US or Putin wants to reignite the Cold War (although the right-wingers, neocons, and military-industrial complex in the US wouldn't mind, and Putin could try to use a revived Cold War to coalesce his power.  ..Too much detailed and intense press coverage at this stage can do more harm than good, if the goal really is to achieve a diplomatic solution. Two reasons: (1) effective diplomatic solutions are rarely achieved in public but are negotiated behind closed doors where all parties can be more honest, open, and have some wiggle room; and (2) face-saving is always an essential part of a workable diplomatic solution, which is made easier by 1 and is likely to generate more long-term cooperation...The longer the posturing and political theater stage drags on for the benefit of image-management and media coveragecircus, the more likely the hardliners will jump onto the stage to push for a win-lose situation and heightened conflict (generally to the benefit of the hardliners who are typically interested in making sure peace does not occur so they can amass more power as well as opportunities for some gain.",,,,,,,

What was Nuuland doing there caught discussing the new Kiev leadership makeup and taped cussing out the reluctant Merkel and EU. Putin is a danger? how about our President that used the despised George Bush 2001 resolution to attack ISIS in Iraq and some real fuzzy language to attack them in Syria. When the President called Russia 'just' regional power must have really helped the popularity of the US in Russia.,Its was a superb subversive game plan by the US to lead a diplomatic snub of the Sochi Olympics and while the Olympics were live they engineered a coup in Kiev. It did not matter that the Ukraine President was elected and had agreed to new elections within 2 months. That was not good enough for the US and forged ahead with coup thinking Putin will not do anything during the Olympics and after it would be too late. Probably that's what happened - hope I'm wrong.,Of course Russia should bow down to the US and let Ukraine become part of NATO with US troops on its border like they are in Estonia. Putin and separatists wanted to extend the seize fire but Kiev refused did the NYT forget that.

He does not need to do much to get Ukraine to lean his way too: give it some time and IMF style advocacy for the West and Ukraine will make its natural choice itself.,"I think all what Putin attempted to communicate is that if you (US) is so upset when I (Russia) move around, then, please, do something to stop the mess and suffering yourself.",It looks like Putin got tired to observe Obama being about a week behind on occurring events.,"Ukraine is loaded with debt and now a lot of infrastructure is destroyed..If the West wants to hurt Putin economically, then why not just let him have the Ukraine?.It will hurt the economy of Russia for a long while for sure.","to David.I really don't see what Putin gained here.Beside points that you mentioned, Putin forced the West (US administration in particular) to show its true intensions towards Russia to the wide range of Russian people, the Putin's electorate, and it has been very effective so far."
Michael S.,,,,"A strong central government was perhaps possible at the start..But the Maidan Movement, from the start, looked upon the ethnic Russians as second-class citizens. The removal of Russian, as the second official language, is a blaring example. All the accusations of the Eastern Ukrainians being little more than dupes of Putin has further poisoned the well.","If Kiev was smart, they would start their first serious talks with the ethnic-Russians of eastern Ukraine..You can point out Russia and the foreign mercenaries till the cows come home, yet, the real needs &amp; desires of the ethnic-Russian Ukrainians of the east must be addressed if Kiev wants to be recognized as legitimate..All Putin is wanting is an agreement for no NATO at his front door and a sincere autonomy for the eastern provinces;.a federation..","Kiev keeps on pointing at Putin and the Caucasus mercenaries..Kiev continues to totally ignore the ethnic-Russian of eastern Ukraine; a vast majority of whom do favor a real level of self-determination..The leaders of Kiev are deceiving themselves, thinking they can force their one-sided agenda on such a large ethnic minority..Unless they come to their senses, either they shall have to live with a long term insurgency, or, they shall force Putin's hand and the Ukraine will be divided at the Dnieper..This is the outcome that Putin has so wisely been working to avoid..(If Putin was half as greedy as our anti-Russian zealots claim he is, the breakup of Ukraine would have already happened.).All Kiev needs to do is give up their pipe dream of someday being part of NATO and give the ethnic-Russian provinces some real say in their future. Too bad if Hunter Biden would have to lower his fracking profit ratio.","Curran,.I don't disagree about the offer Putin made..Yet, that wasn't a sufficient reason to stage the Maidan Coup..Where we are today, is that Kiev should have reached out to the ethnic Russians, instead of simply trying to force their hand..The removal of Russian as a second state recognized language showed Maidan's all or nothing mindset..Seems that, through their obstinance (better word for power-hungry), they lost the whole enchilada.","Knut, exactly, and it was Putin that manipulated Victoria Nuland and the Chocolate Oligarch into staging a coup that would alienate nearly half of Ukraine..A true 4-level chess game..Putin is a true master.","It's a little over two months since the Maidan Coup took control. Nothing has been done to reach out and attempt to accommodate the ethnic Russian population..If Maidan, the EU, and the US wanted a just and legitimate transition of government, a UN observed referendum in the eastern provinces would have been ordered..Instead, we are complicit, forcing the will of the west-friendly Ukrainian oligarchs onto a vast portion of Ukraine that doesn't want to sever their historic ties with Russia...This takeover has nothing to do with freedom, nor democracy. It's an ugly power grab by the top percentile...Those comparing Putin to Hitler are free enterprise fundamentalists simply pushing a lie..So far, the intransigent Kiev Coup has proven their view of ethnic Russians as second-class citizens. Kiev wants the land but would be happy to get rid of their inconvenient minority. Kiev has also greatly empowered Putin. (really smart).But, If Russia does come in, the fault will lie with those pushing to strong arm their way on the ethnic Russian in Ukraine.","VsB,.I didn't even suggest that Russia doesn't have interests..Though, your response seems to put light on why Maidan is so adamant denying the ethnic Russians of East Ukraine any voice..It's kind of like saying, 'well your side is bad too..........BTW: One of the pro-Maidan commenters spoke of Fracking deals with western companies signing contracts last year.

Pushkin,,,,"The shock by Pentagon officials regarding Russian military actions in Syria is laughable. For years Russia has supplied military hardware to Assad regime and has publicly supported him. There should have been no doubt that eventually Russia would come to the aid of Syrian government.  US concern should not be all doom and gloom. The Russians may find that dabbling in mid-east affairs, considering Sunni and Shia mutual hatred, may cost Russia more that making Putin feel good. Russia has plenty of domestic problems which will begin to impinge on Mr Putins world vision in the near future. Another military venture against Islamic peoples should remind Russian citizens of the thousands of body bags which were brought back from Afghanistan. ..Whether the US likes it or not, Mr Putin has at least stood up for someone. It will eventually be a mistake for Russia but considering the murky and dismal US years in mid-east there is something to be said for Putin.","The shock by Pentagon officials regarding Russian military actions in Syria is laughable.

It will eventually be a mistake for Russia but considering the murky and dismal US years in mid-east there is something to be said for Putin.","Why are Ms Merkel and Mr Hollande going into the camp of the offender? I have a feeling they will emerge with peace in our time document. Putin has shown he will agree to anything but will not adhere to it simply because there is no punishment for him by disregarding treaties. It is time for some backbone by European leaders and the US as well. At some point in time, the aggression must stop-and now is the time. There must not be cease-fire deals involving the militants in eastern Ukraine. They cannot be recognized as a legal entity-no matter what it takes. This is a cross roads time for Europe and the US as well. If Putin is not challenged and made to prove his lies, there is no hope for Ukraine. Have the western governments totally forgot about Crimea. Will they forget about Ukraine in the same way? I am apprehensive that European leaders are too fearful of Putin to do what is right- Putin has cast his future and he will not turn back-short of a catastrophic situation for Russia. I hate to bring up the n word but Putin's mind set may not rule it out.","Putin's so called 7 point peace plan looks like something from the foreign ministry of Russia in the 19th century. Of course, it is a false flag- Putin was not shown enough opposition and tough talk about Crimea. Taking measures short of war at that time may have stunned Putin and caused him to rethink his notions about NATO. All that is history and the world needs to find a solution to the present Ukraine situation. There are several questions Ukrainian government should ask itself. Is it really worth it to try to keep several cities and territories in Eastern Ukraine, considering the expected loss of life on both sides.? The best solution, but not one Ukraine would endorse at first reading is to allow Luhansk and Donetsk and some surrounding territory to be absorbed into Russia-but not to exist as a separate state or entity. If this works, cut off these seceded territories from Ukraine by a large wall. They want to be separate-let them. Insure that no goods, vehicles, communications pass to them from Ukraine territory.Let the Russian government who has insisted that these areas are Russian, support them now. Ukraine can pull back it's forces to prepare for the inevitable Russian moves westward in time. After WW2, Russia and her puppet governments managed to construct an iron curtain sealing off eastern Europe from the west. It is time for another iron curtain-this time a real live one-steel and concrete to seal off Russian puppet state in eastern Ukraine.",Ah-political posturing-the scourge of the modern world. The simple solution is to hand over supplies to Red Cross personnel who will insure delivery to those who need it most. If allowed to be delivered into the hands of separatists there is no guarantee that the supplies will reach needy persons-and almost a sure thing that they will not reach them. This is another Putin gambit to give solace and support to the separatists. No matter the contents-it will be viewed as Russian support for the rebels in eastern Ukraine-considering that no other mass delivery of goods has reached the involved areas from western sources.,"The Russian kleptocracy is showing cracks-filtering down to everyone. The economic situation will worsen in 2015 because there is a unified effort-successfully-to run the Russian economy off a cliff using oil glut. Putin bet the whole Russian economy on oil prices and he is loosing and will continue to do so. As time goes by one can hope the drain on the Russian economy will result in slow-down of the defense sector. While Putin's personality will probably see him become more bellicose as the economy sinks-blaming western sanctions-he may have to pay a price by slowly loosing support of the Russian people. If and when Putin comes to his senses it may a good time to sit down with him and explain that the west does not want to destroy Russia-and offer some kind of quid pro quo. It is too dangerous a game for 2 nuclear powers to have another missile crisis. The bottom line for Putin is that his country can progress by diversifying the economy, stopping the aggressive stance to surrounding countries and opening up the government to a more representative model.","Ah-the myth of Minsk strikes again. What a charade by Putin. Western leaders well know Putin will continue his aggression but they have few alternatives. Eventually, there must be a red line for Putin, set in place by European leaders, and the US. Putin knows well that there will be little blowback for his plan to dominate Europe, and maybe more. It is time for sanctions that have a big bite-economically and politically. They will not deter Putin but will demonstrate a willingness to recognize that Russia is a serious threat to world peace. For countries which are invading other countries, recalling ambassadors and reducing embassy may be an appropriate notice of disapproval. Russia is looking more and more like the Stalin era without communism. Now they have Putinism. Is there any real difference?","With Neville Chamberlain looking over his shoulders, Mr Obama has spoken about Ukraine and Russia. We all know that that there is nothing US nor NATO can do in a military sense yet but there is much to do about isolating Russia as a country in the economic, diplomatic and cultural sense. Given that the invasion is a reality-it is time immediately for a strong show of economic force against Russia. Practically, it is now or never. If the EU and US cannot afford to enact the most stringent measures against a rogue country, Europe will have Russians in Kiev and Poland-and worse. ..Stop all interactions of Russian banks with banks in EU and USA..Do not issue visas to any Russian citizen for travel to US and EU countries..Stop any pending cultural exchange programs with Russia. ..Ordinary Russian citizen should come to understand that Mr Putin has made a great mistake on their behalf. Russian mothers and wives have not forgotten the Russian debacle in Afghanistan ..o9","Listening to Putin's speech and watching the body language presents a figure which is no surprise. He is basically a Cold War junkie. The Russian population has been through tough times since the collapse of the USSR. It is very historic to hear Putin falling back on the old rhetoric-after all-what else does he know. He has micromanaged the Russian economy over the cliff, he has another Islamic incident in Grozny-there are economic problems and more to come. Yet we have Mr Putin using much of the same jargon which seems to resonate with the Russian people. So far it resonates-but for how long. The Russian bear has not digested Crimea and Eastern Ukraine yet-they may prove to be a rather difficult economic meal to swallow..It seems obvious that Mr Putin projects the current difficulties as temporary. However, they are not since sanctions and oil prices have follow-ons which may be longer lasting. Once embarked on a push to the west, it seems certain that Mr Putin will continue to try to subvert former territories by subtle means.  What the west can and should do in increase sanctions-there are ample grounds considering the known invasion of Russian tanks and artillery into Eastern Ukraine and the breaking of treaties. It is unfortunate that average Russian citizens may feel the pinch-but most endorse Putin's methods.","It is annoying to read comments which include Russia's natural interest in Ukraine as a defense against invasion. What are Russia's real interests in Ukraine. According to the treaty of 1997 there should be no interests requiring a military invasion. The basic facts are that Russia broke a treaty-nothing new for the Russians or USSR-and now western countries are offering all kinds of excuses to explain Putin's perfidy. Let the facts speak-Russia has no business in Ukrainian territory-including those so called-pro-Russian separatists. NO-it seems to be Ok for a bunch of thugs, bearing Russian arms to proclaim their desire to join Russia!! It is all nonsense but sanctioned by the recent ceasefire. If Ukrainians remember the millions of their citizens starved and enslaved by the Stalin government-they will think about fighting Putin, looking like the Stalin heir apparent,  to the last bullet and last standing person."
Ted Gemberling,,,,"I agree with you. A book from the 70's by David Calleo, The German Problem Reconsidered, showed how Hitler considered the possibility that a voluntary European Community might solve Germany's problems but rejected it. He could not conceive of European unity except on the basis of force. Today Germany has the voluntary alliance which serves its needs very well. ..I hope that Putin or whoever his successor is will see a way to provide for a freer society and the kinds of voluntary economic cooperation that have served Europe and North America so well. This is what the people of Russia need, not just the Ukraine. I hope that a freer Ukraine can lead to a freer Russia, too.",,,,,,,,,
Roger Binion,,,,"Mr. Putin's popularity is due mainly to the non-stop propaganda of the Gazprom owned, Kremlin controlled media...Most people who support Putin are in the hinterlands of Russia and only know what the TV tells them and the TV tells them that Putin is just one or two steps from being the next savior...Putin's popularity in the major cities, especially Moscow, is rather low.","Patricia, Pasadena,..You've heard of the Molotov-Ribbentropp pact, right? That was the non-agression agreement between Hitler and Stalin that allowed for the partition of Poland...Until June, 21, 1941, Nazi Germany and the USSR were non-beligerants in the war and would have stayed that way until Germany invaded...Englad would not have been conquered within weeks. Islands are notoriously difficult to invade. Just ask the Japanese and then the Americans who chose to drop atomic bombs instead of an invasion...There are only a small number of Russians living in Ukraine and those that live there can just move back to Russia...There are, however, ethnic Russian Ukrainians who live there. A rather substantial distinction. And the ethnic Russians are not hated by the Ukrainians. There have been zero instances of ethnic strife in Ukraine since independence in 1991 prior to this Russian instigated war...The reason Putin won't go after Poland, Hungary, Belgium or France is because they are NATO countries. Moldova, and Georgia for that matter, are not. I can assure you, they are rather unsettled by what is happening Ukraine.","More absurd propaganda from Judyw, the Kremlin's biggest and most loyal cheerleader here on the NYT comment boards...Putin should have no more say in what happens inside Ukraine than Robert Mugabe...It is for the Ukrainians to decide and the legal and legitimate government, unlike the coup installed leadership in the fake DPR and LPR, does not want what Putin wants...There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for Kiev to talk to the fake leadership of these fake breakaway areas. None at all...They lost the right to air their grievances to the government the second they took up arms against that government.","Trust me, those mercenaries crossing the border would not being doing so without Putin's approval. Nothing happens in this country without his say so.","Do you honestly think that the GRU andor the FSB is take ownership of this guy? Edward Snowden has said he was a CIA operative for years and yet no confirmation from Langley...And to say that Putin is not 'a messianic ultra-nationaist dreaming of TsraristSoviet times' is to not have been paying attention. And to say he has a 'somewhat warped view of the world' is quite the understatement...As for both NATO and EU expansion, no country has ever been forced to join either, or both. They do that of their own volition and over a period of many, many years. It took Croatia 12 years to get into the EU after independence and 18 years to join NATO...Putin has had considerable time to offer a more attractive alternative to countries looking to join the EU but he has come up empty.","Sadly, the Russian people are fed a steady diet of ridiculous propaganda from state controlled media...I'm certain many Russians believe that the Ukrainian military shot down the plane. One of the more absurd bits of propaganda was that the Ukrainians were targeting Putin's plane as he returned from South America. Of course, his plane didn't even fly over Ukraine, but if the TV tells them this is a possibility, people will, sadly, believe it.",How far back do we get to go? Can we reconstitute the Roman Empire? Maybe Babylonia? Egyptian Empire?..The only people that have a 'better claim' to Ukraine are the Ukrainians and they have decisively turned their back on Russia due to Putin's maneuvers.,"Putin is not an invention of Obama looking for an enemy. Putin has, on more than one occasion, shown his total disdain for the US and the West and it has been Putin who has shown aggression towards the West and its ideals...Perhaps you missed the invasion and subsequent annexation of Crimea. That was all Putin. If that's not Russian aggression then what is?..It must also be noted that the leaders of the separatist regions in eastern Ukraine are all Russian nationals. There isn't a Ukrainian among the whole lot. And to think that these Russians crossed the borders of their own volition to start a war without the seal of approval of Putin is to totally not understand how he works.","Well Mark, you are missing the 10,000 green men from Russia who occupied Crimea, apparently. Even Putin has acknowledged that there were Russian special forces...No one under military occupation is free so to say that the election was free is to ignore the very implicit threat of those 10,000 armed men if the vote did not go the way they wanted it to.","It was George W. Bush that nominated both Ukraine and Georgia to become NATO members inflaming Russian passion and causing untold amounts of paranoia to creep into Putin's psyche...So, sure. Let's bring W back since he basically started this mess."
jeff f,,,,"The biggest slap to Putin would be the economic success of Ukraine. We appear to be doing nothing on this score. We should quietly and deniably be training and arming a Ukrainian defensive force. Again we appear to be.Doing nothing.

Our message to him is why not?",What Putin is doing in Ukraine is naked aggression. Apparently you have trouble calling it that because we have been bad actors too. A more reasoned statement on your part is we are both bad. But it seems you can't see one for the other.,,,,,,,,
pstewart,,,,"When President Putin described the fall of the USSR as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, he was speaking rhetorically, but he was not completely inaccurate. Many people in the former USSR suffered terribly from the loss of the Soviet economic and social structure. Looting of public resources for private gain in the post-Soviet period has made the situation worse. The home-grown variety of such opportunism  hasn't benefited Americans either. When Secretary Kerry speaks of the Russian invasion of the Ukrainian homeland, he is also speaking rhetorically and perhaps with even less accuracy. Eastern Europe is the homeland of many different peoples. Both Russia and the US seem to be trapped in the rhetoric of the Cold War and of Nationalism. It doesn't move either of us forward. And we do face similar problems.",,,,,,,,,
Steve,,,,"As much as I am inclined to view Putin as an unenlightened, nationalist power hungry thug, I can't help but wonder why, if Crimea is so overwhelmingly made up of Russians who want to be Russians and not Europeans, is it such a violation of natural law for it to be so.  So much of what was unsustainable about the Soviet Union was the result of forcing people who wanted to have their own separate cultural and national identities into being essentially Russian.  Now you have a bunch of Russians in Crimea who would rather be Russian than Ukrainian or European. How sustainable is it to force them to be something that they don't want to be. I think the disfunctionality of Ukrainian politics and economics up to this point sot of makes the case.","No one has explained at any level why we should be concerned that Russia has annexed a region that is majority Russian.  There is certainly truth to the statement that Putin is correcting a previous error; I can appreciate that we don't want Putin to 'reconstitute' the former Soviet Union, but why would one think that is his plan.  I think the administration has handled this in the most appropriate way possible, but not over-reacting.","Go, Putin.  And it is not often that I would say that.  But if Russia, Iran, Iraq and the Syrian government can and will take care of ISIS, they should have at it.  I personally do not care whether the U.S. can figure out a way to cooperate with them.  If anything we need to step back and let them take care of their own back yard.  U.S. influence in that region ultimately translates into U.S. blood and lives, and I am sick to death of it...ISIS is a horror.

We saw where that led.  Putin is no Stalin.  He should have at it in Syria.","Assad has focused his attacks primarily if not exclusively on non-ISIS targets. He does not want a moderate opposition to have any chance. He assumes the West will fight ISIS.

Good for them.,"As expected, Russians poured soldiers and heavy tech across the border while negotiations were underway, to swiftly secure as large an area as possible. Western media's insistence on speaking about rebels or russian-backed forces is pathetic: they are simply Russian forces, and their goals are set in Kremlin...Whether this ceasefire holds or not, Europe should prepare for another round, rather soon. Putin has won again and his appetite will grow. Again. See you in the Baltic - or wherever the line will be weakest...P.S.

Dream on buddy.,"I'm starting to think of Putin less as a glorified organized crime boss type thug and more as a deluded Little Prince who is just shrewd enough to appeal to the wounded pride of a people struggling with their sense of national identity, but not smart enough or enlightened enough to see his country's best interests in the context of a much larger picture of economic well being. It just boggles my mind that he and his people can't see the advantage of benignly stitching Russia into an increasingly seamless global patchwork where competition and cooperation tend more toward optimal functionality."

It seems safe to observe that the contested space was Russian, making  the sympathies of the shooter clear. ..True,  Russia once intentionally shot down an America-originated passenger airliner containing a member of our government -- which somewhat legitimates the impulse to suspect a Putinesque contrivance -- but until someone provides evidence that Putin was attempting to restore the good old-days of mutually assured destruction,  I give Putin the benefit of the doubt.

Putin's inflammation of Ukraine has had unspeakably tragic consequences already.  The world must militate for reason as the response.","The US mission is to protect civilians, and to slow ISIS' spread into another country.   Support for shadowy rebel groups  was never a goal -- merely a tactic to support the larger mission.  ..In attempting to repel the threats to its naval base, and to appease domestic Russian militarism,  Putin has attempted to seek personal benefit from  the US presence and support.  ..That is why the US should suspend its anti-ISIS airstrikes, now that Russia has airstrike capacity in the area.  Repositioning of US force should permit the US to use its anti-ISIS power elsewhere (or not), in a way that encourages both Putin and Assad to protect civilians and refugees.  ..There is no guarantee that brutal dictators will ever keep their word, but in this case,  both Assad and Putin have gone out on a limb, and need some  level of US support.","Putin understands that NATO will move into Ukraine if violent secessions continue with Russian applause, whether or not Russian troops actually cross the border.  Once in, NATO will never be gone, and Putin will be destroyed domestically...At this juncture, the West has full freedom to choose between a paranoid and a diplomatic response.",

Putin was in Turkey last December! Erdogan was flattered by his visit, thought they were made for each other!","Putin maintained Assad's forces were the only legitimate conventional army there. The Western-led airstrikes so far have avoided targeting Assad's positions on the battlefield. This allows the regime forces to wipe out all enemies with ferocity. Perhaps this is the first step to ethnic cleansing!.Will Putin be able to convince Obama to put aside their differences and join together in the fight against Islamic State? He wants to come in from the cold - rebranding Russia from pariah to partner and diverting attention away from Ukraine, while retaining a degree of influence in Syria and boosting Russia's international image. The question is whether the Sunni Arabs would let him have his way!","Putin has been isolated since Russia's annexation in Crimea, the aggression and terrible incident with the Malaysian passenger plane  in Eastern Ukraine. The hostility was so unbearable during the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia in November 2014 that he cut short his visit. He faced  repeated criticism from world leaders. Perhaps he wants to come in from the cold..Should Obama talk to Putin? Why not!.What Ambassador John Herbst said: Meeting with the Russian strongman would only make the president look weak, is inappropriate. The world is in such a bad state that no leader should put hubris and pride ahead of the global common good - peace and stability.","Although Putin urged the world to come together  to fight ISIS in Syria, he has definitely no desire to wait for its response.  Given the tepid support for the Assad regime, it is unlikely that a broad coalition will emerge. So the US and its allies will have have to watch Russia act unilaterally and legally, as Russia says, at Assad's behest.  Putin sees Assad as the only legitimate leader in Syria and the last bulwark  against terrorism..But Russia will be drawn into a multi-layered conflict. For the moment it says it won't put boots on the ground, as the debacle in Afghanistan is still fresh in many Russians' memory..Right now Putin may be basking in self-assertiveness that he is a man of swift decision. But his  actions could fuel more hostility both at home and abroad. Russia's approach to the quagmire  in Syria is brutally pragmatic, as it will assist Assad to bomb all enemies of the regime - opposition groups, Kurds, al Qaeda affiliats, ISIS - and worst of all, civilians, who find themselvs trapped in targeted areas and who can't escape. Experts say the Russian air force lacks many of the precision-guided capabilities and intelligence gathering resources that the US-led coalition has..We will see what Putin has to say, when world leaders come together for the next G20 summit on November 15 in the Turkish city of Antalya.","Although Putin urged the world to come together  to fight ISIS in Syria, he has definitely no desire to wait for its response.

If he lets popular power thrive, he fears of being held to account. He is trying to save his own skin, as he has skeletons in his closet. According to the German TV channel, ARD, Putin may be the wealthiest man on earth - more than what Gates and Buffet have together..His playbook is to capitalise on patriotic and chauvinistic euphoria. After all, he has the Kremlin-friendly media on his side, and he can sell his people almost anything. Many of them are uninterested in politics and have only scant knowledge of the issues at hand. The Russian Orthodox Church and the Kremlin go hand-in-hand. Since the demise of Leninism, ordinary Russians turn to Orthodox Christianity for spiritual comfort. State medias vitriolic attacks on the Wests decadent morals mean Russians are willing to accept any economic and social hardships brought about by Western sanctions..The Sino-Russian tie is just a marriage of convenience. China knows Russia's weakness, and Moscow doesn't trust Beijing. For the moment they share a common interest - to challenge the current world order.","Angela Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder turned 70 on April 7. A few days ago, Putin threw a party for him in St. Petersburg. The two were seen hugging each other. Schroeder has long had close ties to Putin and runs the Nordstream pipeline bringing Russian gas to Germany. He also seems to have forgotten that he still ought to act responsibly for his country as a former head-of-state.","Putin's demand sounds like an ultimatum. Will he invade Eastern Ukraine if Kiev ignores his demand? No doubt Putin's aggressiveness and bossiness  make the leadership jitter. He knows he has the upper hand, as there is no one to stop him. So he pushes hard to achieve his goal..Lawmakers in Kiev and discussed the possibility of holding a nationwide referendum on whether to change their governing structure and transfer more powers to the regions. But they couldn't reach consensus. Yulia Tymoshenko, whose party dominates the interim government and the parliament, has warned against ceding too much authority to the regions and putting unity at risk..They ought to know, what their priority is: more centralised power or more stability and the survival of their country!","Putin told the Italian Corriere Della Sera that Russia would not suddenly attack NATO, by invading the former Soviet satellite states on its western border. But he could always stoke unrest among the Russian-speakers in the region, just as he is doing in Eastern Ukraine. Even if Russia would not invade the Baltic states, which have a sizeable Russian population, Putin would have his satisfaction, if the region became unstable and lived in fear. This would have an impact on the integration-efforts of the European Union as well.","Perhaps the prospect that a Russian company can't have access to U.S. financial institutions and use the dollar in transactions has made Putin change his position - a measure of the Treasury Department against Russia.   So far Putin has proven himself indispensable in resolving the conflict in Ukraine. Yet the separatists are defiant and are fed up with Kiev. They want to hold the referendum and secede, saying they would do it with or without Putin. He is in a dilemma. On the one hand, it suits him that pro-Russian regions secede. On the other hand, he gets the blame for not reining in the resentments and faces sanctions."

Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'.....The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of most minorities. When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the national interest first, observing that the minorities are not Russians.","how can we possibly be diplomatic in our dealings with Russia and President Putin?..O, poor vilified Putin, who only invaded Sovereign Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine, that happens to be largest wholly in Europe country , in 2014 - both under same pretext as Hitler occupied Austria and Czechoslovakia...Putin also talks with straight face in front of cameras about using human shield formed from locals, in front of his troops, which Hitler was also known to do, only it wouldn't occur to him to boast about it....and how dare anybody Clinton or anybody else define Putin's actions in such uncharming language!","Russian agents in Eastern Ukraine ... can operate there because they have found resonance with a large part of the population there...No, they can operate because local mayors are remnants of former Yanukovich PoR rule.  In East all positions in local administrations were held by PoR people.  Small crowds of supporters are hired from local criminals, drunks and addicts, some supporters are not even locals, but travel for hire from one place to another, many come from occupied Crimea.... Ukrainian (and foreign) Journalists, Ukrainian activists  are being kidnapped and intimidated - there is no show of true extend of public outrage with presence of armed to the teeth thugs.  Western Media takes photos, videos from Russian sources only.  For example, few days ago there was 7,000 Ukrainian demonstration in  Kharkiv, few-thousand demonstrations in Donetsk and Lugansk... anybody shown them?  No. All Western articles feature Russian flags, pro-Russian crowds, few Western journalists on ground take interviews not with Ukrainian public, not with colleges of slaughtered Ukrainian activist, not with outraged by bandits local population, but with masked terrorists, analyzing how they play football in their free time....There is no resonance with a large part of the population there.  Even before Majdan survey shown only 14 of Ukraine in favor of Putin's Eurasian  idea..But there is, indeed, appeasement by the West Putin's aggression in Ukraine.","each side of the country's violently divided population.Joseph, there was NO violently divided population in Ukraine, until Putin started his conniving, provocations and goebbels-style propaganda..Much of the country wants strong ties to the west; much of the country wants strong ties to the east... even prior to Majdan, in Nov. 2013, polls shown only 14 in favor of Putin's pet project Eurasion Union.

Phillip,,,,"What's really astounding is that Putin is doing all this leading a country with a GDP only slightly larger than California's. And In addition to the strain being put on Russia's economy by the billions being spent on Putin's Crimean and East Ukraine adventures, Russian food prices are soaring do to Western sanctions, adding to the already existing day-to-day misery experienced by most Russians. ..Nevertheless, Putin's approval rating among his countrymen appears stellar. ..Decades after Churchill said it, Russia continues to be a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.",And who in the world outside the US and EU are applauding Putin?

The president's already gotten that answer. The British and Europeans, who have much more leverage with Putin given their greater trade engagement with Russia, have decided to do nothing. ..In the end it's about the US and its European and Asian allies facing reality and de-conditioning themselves from 65 years believing the US must always take the lead in solving these sorts of problems by virtue of its economic and military might. This in spite of, among other examples, the catastrophic failures of Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan...Fortunately, at least for now, we have a president, secretary of state and secretary of defense who understand this reality. We may be less fortunate after '14 and '16",,,,
CNoble,,,,"And history repeats.  The language and deeds from both the west and Putin mirror that of history both near and afar.  The calculus that will be used by Putin and others going forward will be viewed through the the classes of Crimea. How can anyone suggest sanctions on 21 individuals will deter future state aggresion?  Baltic states, Poland, and other eastern EU  NATO should be nervous. Putin has annexed land from another country predicated on selective interpretation of history and under the guise of protection of Russian speaking peoples with virtually no costs...Perhaps far more reaching implications should be the impact on Asia and the challenges many countries have with China's historical interpretation of what they have claim to. And even potentially having more impact on the destabilization on a global scale will be the continued erosion of the purpose and authority of the UN. Clearly Russia can not use the UN card (not that Putin won't try) in the future. The UN has proven yet again to be a wetted paper kitten...Selective interpretation of history is dangerous,   leads to notions of self righteous claims, and all too often leeds to conflict. History has repeatedly demonstrated appeasement fails and only embolden the aggressors.  Sanctions limited to a handful of individuals is appeasement. The price of land in Europe is cheapened viewed under the prism of sanction riskcosts benefits...But we won't allow facts to interfere with perfecly good misconceptions.","Clearly, the proof needs to be in the actions. It is very typical strategy for Putin to offer up olive branches to throw the west off guard.  The massing troops, the new calls for referendums in the east, continued complaints of abuse of Russian speakers in East Ukraine... all very reminiscent and oddly familiar with words spoken right before the annexation of Crimea.  ..Accusing Putin of not living to 21st century ideals may have volition; however, just because we wish it doesn't mean others will do so. Just because you won't eat a lion, doesn't mean the lion won't eat you...Hopefully those in the White House will review history - from the last century AND of a few months ago - while dealing with someone who has no integrity.  Stealing a superbowl ring should offer a good idea and view into how Putin thinks.","Putin is a lot of thinks... but blinking at this stage is not in his character. ..He seems to want Ukraine, since he was unable to influence it into a Russian led trade pack, to either be a federation (which makes it near impossible to become an EU partner) or at worst (for him) to have written into their constitution that it will not join any pact thus remaining something of a buffer state. ..The troops on the border is a bargaining chip and one he can play quickly at this point should negotiations not go in a Russian acceptable way. His timing of the phine call and the readiness of those troops is not a coincidence. ..How Russia and the rest of the world views the EU and US will be formed predicated on whether we take a stand, acquiesce, or appease Russia.",Not sure why we expect modern behavior from a head of state who is essentially a thug. Any person that would pocket a superbowl ring couldn't be trusted in any capacity... let alone with upholding international laws...If anyone believes this is the last of Putin's aggressions upon the world... there is a bridge in NYC for sale.,"The US has to take a lead yet again; unfortunately after dithering around and drawing red-lines that were not held (if one plans not to do something if crossed, one should not draw them) the calculus utilized by both aggressors and allies alike is a hedge. The Russians clearly think we are bluffing and clearly feel the EU will continue to dither with no clear and credible leadership coming out of Washington.  The EU - as is so typical - wants the US to front the bill of defense vis-a-vis sanctions and political capital and continues to deploy the Hope strategy.  One would expect with over 40 hostages - all EU citizens - that the EU would be a little more outraged...The EU leaders aren't stupid - the US gets to spend treasure and political capital now and the EU gets to slowly wean itself of Russian dependency at little or no cost. The light at the end of this tunnel is Putin will eventually be left stewing in his own Russian juices... blamimg the west (the US centrally as it the EU is accomplishing by not taking the lead they should be) for all thier woes.",Well said Charlie.  Opportunistic nations will seize on any perceived weakness and assume an unwillingness or inability to challange the aggresion. As you aptly showed in WWI with Austria.  Suppose that if we had stepped into the frey - say when the Sudentland was annexed or even before - the vast majority of death and destruction WWII brought could have been avoided?? The Allies had ample chance to stop WWII when German broke the Treaty of Versailles (no comment on its failings and the issues it created)... but we failed to act. I hope the Budapest Memorandum doesn't come to pass as our failure to act in the face of aggression of a weaker neighbor. ..Perhaps Crimea would not be an issue if the world had acted with more than a wag of the finger when Putin annexed parts of Georgia...The calculus used by Putin and even China with its SCS and ECS disputes will shift post-Crimia. How the west reacts will determine if that calculus inches the world towards its next global war or towards the general prosperity of nations since the end of WWII.,"Regardless of political alignment; be it leftest or right-wing, history seems to be lost to most I fear.  The words and deads coming from both sides share some (and in some cases - many) mirroring of years past. The Romans fell predicated greatly on their Senator's desire to destroy each other rather than govern; not unlike the childish bickering witnessed any day via CSPAN. China feels historical precedence of glorious empires past and the fearful knowledge that assuring resources to supply a vast population or face domestic unrest much akin to the motivation of Imperial Japan. Russia too feels a massive inferiority complex and views itself as a great power - it built St. Petersburg to rival that of great European cities - and acts out like a lone petulant child as they are unable to convince anyone (including the Chinese as it appears) that they should be viewed in awe. The EU, in all its expressions of cultural awareness, has a difficult time agreeing on much of anything. If there is one thing we as a people should remember - be you American, Russian, or European - is that passivity allows the opportunistic to take advantage and plunge the rest of us into their narrative. Maybe the phrase Chamberlainism should be (re)coined. If the world allows Putin to take territory without a massive cost; we embolden him and others to do so again.  When is enough history repeated to finally end the cycle?..Just because you won't eat the lion, doesn't mean the lion won't eat you.","The sactions, as they are, clearly reflect the world's apprehension of damage to their own interests; however, it seems to also reflect the west's caution of forcing an unpredictable Putin into a corner. At some point, Russia has little left to loose. Politically, Putin could not leave Crimea under any realistic circumstance without severe backlash at home. At some point, his inner circle will view actual (real) sactions as too costly for just crimea and the drum beat for moving on east Ukraine will be such that the calculus to them supports such a move. The troop and logistics buildup along the border of Ukraine is clearly a reminder they still have the option. ..For me, an unpredictable Russia that is unstable is deeply concerning. The EU for decades has continually reduce their military expenditures significantly and have more than ever relyed on the US to provide that securtity umbrella. As the EU - and NATO - has expanded, the various interests have also expanded as clearly demonstrated in the sactions to date. Getting 28 countries to agree is not unlike hurding cats. ..Given the EU history of appeasement and capitulation, one could foresee that Russia will move on further territories it sees as an historical imperative for them. The inevitable consequence is also foreseeable: an EU or a NATO country will be at the receiving end and may tip the world into open conflict. ..History should serve as a guide. 3 land grabs later - Sudentland was yesterday's Crimea.",@camd: and all the more reason to assure the world doesn't plunge into the narrative set out by the likes of Putin by allowing undeterred aggresion to stand. When Putin believes we (the west) are affraid and will appease and capitulate any act (say... take back the Baltic NATO members); that is when the calculus assures war.  ..Best way to avoid war is to assure the aggressors we will respond one way or the other.,"The marvel of people's short term memories, not in terms of days or years, but in decades and centuries. So many ask why we should get involved with other's problems. History is littered with looking the other way; people throughout time bury their heads in the sand and hope the problem over there goes away. It doesn't.  Can we suppose that if we had stepped into the frey - say when the Sudentland was annexed or even before with Austria - the vast majority of death and destruction WWII brought could have been avoided??..Perhaps Crimea would not be an issue if the world had acted with more than a wag of the finger when Putin annexed parts of Georgia...Passivity breads opportunistic thinking. If aggressors understand the respond will be equal or greater force - be it economic andor militarily - they simply would not tread over the line...History repeats itself over and over again. Allowing Putin to annex Crimea may well embolden him to take more; eastern Ukraine perhaps. Just as importantly - maybe even more so - others (China?) are watching and how they view the west's response and willingness to act will now become part of their calculus in how far they go. This inevitably leads to miscalculation with predictable consequences. The world is a small place and although it effects us indirectly now; eventually always directly. My question: how many more wars and lives lost will it take to end the cycle? The surest way to invite war is to try to pacify."
S.B.,,,,Obama and Nuland have lost their poker game in Ukraine and awarded Crimea into Putin's hands. 5 billion of our money is basically spent on a doubtful coup    that may split Ukraine even further.,Those who want the original translation of Putin's speech should be smart enough to search for official sources...,"Sending arms to Ukraine? Terrible idea. Since Russia's military manpower far outnumbers Ukraine's, who is going to operate all those weapons to fight against the Russian forces? What's more, a military conflict would give Putin the justification (in his mind, and that of Russians, at least) to totally conquer Ukraine and make it part of Russia again. ..The only way supplying arms to Ukraine makes sense is if the West were to commit ground troops to overcome that country's huge deficit in manpower-- and I don't think any western country is even considering sending ground troops in...On another note, Putin wants Ukraine to let its provinces vote to gain more autonomy. But he doesn't want that in his own country, of course. You won't see him letting Chechnya, for example, vote on whether it wants to have autonomy or independence from Russia.","Putin is a thug, but he's managed to keep his approval ratings among his constituents above 80. Obama is in the 40 range. If nothing else, Putin is good at managing public opinion, while Obama seems inconsistent, rudderless, unable to communicate effectively with the people or with Congress.","Unfortunately for Ukraine, and the West, Putin doesn't care what anyone outside of Russia thinks of him. His approval ratings are sky high among his citizens, in part because the Russian media whips up the nationalistic spirti by spinning the Putin party line. ..I'm not sure even a united front could stop Putin if he really wants to make more trouble in Ukraine, but it's worth a shot... it's basically all the West has.",Is it just me or is this the pre-amble or a parallel to the Third Reich ideals and purity laws etc. by Putin's ambitions?,Is it just me or is this the pre-amble or a parallel to the Third Reich ideals and purity laws etc. by Putin's ambitions?,"I'm all for energy efficiency, and for reducing the West's dependence on Russian oil &amp; gas, but I don't see how that's going to give the West the leverage to make Putin behave any better as a world citizen. His actions are based on his worldview; that view is not going to change with a reduction in Russia's energy sales (which Friedman himself calls a long-term strategy). ..Similarly, saying that the oil glut of the 1980s helped collapse Soviet Communism is quite an overstatementoversimplification. There are a number of reasons why the U.S.S.R. collapsed.",,
Onno Frowein,,,,"The question is what can Obama gain in meeting with President Putin since so far Putin has been very successful in isolating the USA from the largest part of the World. He has been able to consolidate anti USA countries like China, India, South Africa and Brazil in BRICS, countries with great economic potentials...On the contrary USA is trying to monopolize its trade positions in Europe and Asia with in-transparent so-called trade deals like Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) or Trans Pacific Partnership all favoring the USA and its large companies legal positions like Monsanto Roundup and GMO and so on. It's for good reasons that these negotiations are kep secret from the public since it will be opposed by the people in Europe and Asia...So President Putin has nothing to lose in meeting with Obama the pressure is on Obama who has to come with good arguments for US sanctions and finally will have to show facts and evidence about the shootdown of MH 17 killing 298 people while USA has its satellites over this region and finally the so-called aggression by Russia towards Ukraine (without ANY proves) and finally USA's aggression in Iraq, Syria, Libya and Ukraine supporting opposition with Dollars and arms..And finally, let's not forget who is responsible for the mess in the Middle east causing now the millions of refugees entering Europe not because of Assad, but because of ISIS terrorists and the bombing by USA and NATO.

We in Europe have suffered 2 world wars and many of us remember WW II with all its human losses and destruction. We have learned to respect life and talknegotiate with our opponents as civilized people instead of taking a gun and shoot your opponent as is the American Way...Finally, when the Soviets wanted to install missiles in Cuba in 1962 under JFK their was a civilized approach from the White House resulting in the withdrawal. At that time NO European leader was consulted or did a European leader imposed sanctions on the USA in case of although the threat of WW III was very actual. So if a Russian President protects his country from USNATO aggression and installation of BAM 's at his doorsteps in Poland, Romania, Georgia he is expected to sit still? Russia knows that USA doesn't honnor their pacts.Russia is NOT the aggressor USANATO is!","US so-called democracy policies in the world has not worked for a bit and resulted in mass killings among the 'liberated' citizens without any new leader..From Vietnam, former Yugoslavia to Iraq and Ukraine US foreign policy is based on overthrowing, invading and ultimately military aggression for the past 60 years. Now that the USA is basically bankrupt it wants Western nations to clean up their mess they started in Iraq to bomb ISIS Muslim extremists which started in US prisons in Iraq and possibly Guantanamo..Ms. Gessen's article is again written in a Western concept not understanding the people of Kirgizstan and other former Soviet Republics and they prefer the stability of a peaceful association with Russia instead of a corrupt and aggressive USANATOEU. They want security for their families and children NOT a violent society the USA stands for..Travelling frequently in the former Soviet Republics I see more people relaxed and happy than I have seen in USA or EU where people are stressed out in the democratic 'RAT RACE'  for survival. And let's not talk about inequality either..Kyrgysztan is a member of the Russia's independent states (CIS) and is  more interested to maintain contacts with Russia then with the West. Under the leadership of president Putin the Kyrgyzi can look into the future with security and confidence rather then the western postulated dream of freedom and high unemployment..NYT is representing a one-sided US view not a culturaldemographical one!","The USEU anti Russia propaganda is now becoming ridiculous, the pictures shown are those of Right extremists under their leader and UA presidential candidate Dmytro Yarosh. He is a well known terrorist and also was active in Chechnya and is on the international Interpol list. He was also the leader on Maidan responsible for killing policemen and protesters. And most recently he was seen in Slavjansk where 5 pro-Russian Militia were murdered on Eastern Day, a Day of Peace, very much honored by the Russian Orthodox people in Russia and Ukraine..It seems that the USA is anxious to start a war again, and of course on non-USA territory just to show its military superiority and hopefully build respect again since USA lost its commercial power since Obama came into the White House. The personal relationship between President Putin and Obama has been complex surrounded by personal disagreements. Granting NSA Edward Snowden asylum was a slab in the face of the USA since any escape from Moscow was made impossible by USA closing EU airspace.The USANATO irresponsible support and finance of right extremists in Kiev and overthrowing a democratically elected government started this UA anarchism NOT Russia..By the way what is the USA doing in the UA in the first place or is this to hide it's complete failure in the diplomatic field and especially Obam's RED Line debacle. US track record in the world is destabilizing nations like Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Afghanistan, etc..YANKEE GO HOME, PLEASE!","The anti-Russia and anti Putin keeps on coming from NYT, MSM propaganda and brainwashing of the American public while all domestic unemployment and racial problems in USA are ignored in the press...Russia is standing strong with a strong leader in contrast to USA and Europe that have no leadership except for a lot of talks, lies and sanctions. USA lost their wars in Vietnam, Iraq, Syria and many other countries but apparently hasn't learned their lessons yet. Apparently the defence lobby is too powerful while American young are coming back in body-bags or get their throat cut...With a debt equal to its GDP of  16 trillion Washington rather invests in arms and wars abroad than solving its own domestic and social problems...President Putin protects his people and borders and has an 85 approval rating most western leaders envy. President Putin is stopping US and NATO colonial or geopolitical ambitions in  the World and he deserves all the support of the free world. His support even in Germany is growing and reached 40 while anti-American sentiments worldwide are at a low. The Amerivan story teller Obama shows again how vulnerable America has become in the last 30 years.","Interesting analysis, however, requiring some correction such Georgia attack on Abkhazia and S.Ossetia NOT by Russians who later deployed security forces along the borders with Georgia. Also in those days Russia was warned about invading Georgia. And guess what today we hear the same Western rhetoric telling the public Russia is going to invade Ukraine! Despite agreements USA installed ABM missiles in Georgia, Poland and Bulgaria, so it was not that the Russians couldn't be trusted but USA whose aggressive policies are known worldwide in the name of democracy. The USA started more than 30 wars and invasions since 1950 under the heading of Democracy, where is the democracy in Iraq, Thailand, Libya, Serbia, etc..President Putin stopped the US dominance in the world and therefore the USAEU started this Anti-Russia smear campaign. Russia is only protecting its nation against subversive Western colonialism or as it is called today geopolitical strategy..But now the West realizes that President Putin indeed is the most important leader in the world and certainly NOT a PUSHOVER. USA never started a similar smear campaign against China when it annexed TIBET or its expansion in South Eastern Asia or Africa or its continuous violations of Human Rights? No word from Washington or Brussels China is too powerful, has too much money and especially too much private conglomerates involved. China is simply too powerful for the West and therefore NO SMEAR campaign against China  diplomacy"
Jonathan Baker,,,,"I hold Putin directly responsible for the murder of 298 innocent passengers on Malaysia Airlines flight 17. Putin supplied the missiles to his thugs and they did his bidding. ..It is amazing how many friends Putin has posting here, and his megalomaniac delusions of a return to Stalinist domination of eastern Europe fills their hearts with joy. ..What WW I and II demonstrated is that when thugs are not opposed abruptly they will plunder and murder until they are stopped. Meanwhile Putin is murdering or imprisoning all his political opponents and making a merry sport of terrorizing homosexuals. What a guy!",Who started the war? Putin. Everything in all directions flows outward from there. Putin has no legal or moral validation for invading Ukraine - a particularly inconvenient truth.,"I don't see how Putin loses by supplying weapons of mass murder to the separatist rebels since there will not be any meaningful retaliation against him.  And Putin knows what everyone knows: Europe will remain passive, and the U.S. public has no appetite for getting involved in another war at the moment. ..From Putin's perspective, let western newspapers and politicians issue their condemnations against him - it will pass and be forgotten soon enough.  It is all win-win for Putin - his bullying against Ukraine now rewards him with an all-time high 83 approval rating inside Russia. ..Putin now has what he really wanted from the start: control of the underwater oil and gas reserves off the coast of Crimea that are worth trillions of dollars, and thereby increasing his energy-stranglehold on Europe. These are good times, happy times, for Putin, and life is has never looked so good.","I do not doubt those of Russian ethnicity remain loyal to their Rus' Dynasty heritage, and let's face it, who wouldn't want to be fully re-united with Russia's soaring economy, its brilliantly efficient bureaucracies that are the envy of the world, and its unmatched record for human rights? Only a fool would deny that Putin has almost completely eliminated cronyism and corruption during his progressive leadership, and freedom of speech and diversity is guaranteed.   ..The idea that so many Ukrainians would reject thorough integration with Russian and all is has achieved during the past twenty years simply boggles the mind.","Tom, you make too many excuses on behalf of Putin's land-grab. ..To the degree that Putin has enormous popular support of his own people does not validate him any more than Hitler's support of Germans in his day validated his evil. I do not find your moral equivalency to be either moral or accurate. Because the USA or Ukraine has violated basic principles of democracy and justice in the past does not absolve Russia from criticism in the here and now. ..Ethical and legal accountability are the basis of useful morals and laws, and to dissolve accountability is to dissolve civilization and replace it with a criminal state ruled by thuggery and corruption.","To build a wall of resistance to withstand Putin's territorial aggression is right and necessary for the integrity of all the former Iron Curtain countries. Yet it also plays into Mr. Putin's game plan of reviving the Cold War. We all know the game because we all live through it daily from every angle - the Other is the enemy and we must put aside grievances to rally 'round to defend the Mother Land, or Home Land as we say here in the USA.  ..Yes, we must resist Putin, but will the Russian people resist him? No, they will reward him with the highest approval ratings in his political career. Maybe Putin is the result, not the cause, of a deeper problem.","Given Russian's notoriously corrupt and unresponsive bureaucracies and oppressive human rights history I find it 'impressive' that anyone would desperately seek to be under Putin's domination. But hey, there's no accounting for tastes. ..I look with some skepticism about how much these 'popular' revolts in Eastern Ukraine actually represent actual popular opinion there. But if possible, let a democratic vote determine the outcome, and let the proverbial chips fall where they may. The more Ukraine unloads resentful Russians the lighter is its load to move forward to a better future.","Putin's popularity is at an all-time high inside of Russia, and those are the only polling numbers he needs to care about. ..Since WWII Europe has relied on the U.S. to be its bodyguard which is why their military budgets are a fraction of ours (hence they can afford nice things). But they are in denial of reality if they think they can become dependent on Russian oil and not become satellite states, little by little, sure as night follows day.","The question of the hour is: just how much real estate divested by the USSR following its humiliating collapse does Putin intend to take back? ..Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia seem beyond all rational expectation of a Putin land-grab because they really would push the drama forward to WWIII..But what about taking back Romania, or Bulgaria, or Turkistan, or Mongolia?  ..So the question by the world to Putin is, Quo Vadis?","I appreciate it when a columnist provides a perspective that had not occurred to me, and Brooks did that today by illustrating Putin's fascination with writings of Berdyaev, Solovyov, and Ilyin. I was oblivious of that angle, and it provides an insight into Putin's motives and actions, which otherwise appear inexplicable at times."

Good thing that Putin is sorting it out. Let Putin Run the world.","Yup, you nailed it. Putin went to his own parliament and got approval from it. He then argued at the UN for the war. How about all of Putin's allies that went into Ukraine, like er, ah........no one? How about the fact the that he denied any involvement at all. So, Bush and Cheney are the same as Putin? Why are they not in office until possibly 2024? This moral equivalency isn't working at all. It should have been passe by the 1960s. It's not even a good intellectual argument. Bet it resounds well in a sound chamber.","Yeah, the old moral equivalency argument.  So, Putin is the same as Obama.","The FSB spy on it's own citizens? Why, never. Putin is a great civil libertarian. Just look at all the human rights organisations there.","Yea, right. Like the US invading Canada a few years ago? How about us moving into Mexico? Sorry friend, your moral equivalency won't wash here. Putin is trying to expand Russian borders. You really can't defend it.",Putin is trying to takeover the Ukraine. Kiev has been talking and not giving Putin the answer he wants. They had to fight.,"The Ukrainians are defending their own country. They did not send in SF units to ferment revolution in Russia.

NYHuguenot,,,,Putin is applying every skill he gained as a KGB operative. I think we lack the ruthlessness he possesses and the will to accomplish what he sets out to do. The Russian people are used to deprivation and whether they support Putin or not will endure any sanctions.,"And, as before, the Kremlin has both the intention and capacity to undermine governments and states, using instruments like the military, money, media, the secret police and energy. Substitute Kremlin for Washington and the secret police for the NSA and the CIA and you are describing the USA. This has occurred because the US became naive and too trusting. It has pursued a weakening of our military while others are building on to theirs. We unilaterally broke a promise to the Poles and Russia has gained an advantage. Diplomacy without arms is like music without instruments Bismark Our idea of diplomacy is to come with a gun in one hand and a sandwich in the other.Bismark. The US brought two sandwiches and Putin is eating both of them.","It's difficult to believe that so many people think Putin did not anticipate the rhetoric and sanctions coming from the West before his actions with Crimea. The gas dependent nations will fold if they even bother and no reaction is coming from anywhere other than the US and Western Europe. As a KGB agent Putin is well versed in the art of creating confusion and skullduggery, no different than the CIA operatives the US has used since WW2 to undermine governments. Now that the West had revealed its tactics he will employ his plans to counter them. Watch. This guy is no Barack Obama or Jimmy Carter.",,,,,,,
Doug,,,,"I think it is terribly nave for anyone to think Putin won't invade Ukraine, at least the eastern half, if not all, and another neighbor.  ..It's too bad Ukraine just can't allow them leave and then join the EU anyway.  ..I agree we need to support Ukraine to the FULLEST.",Every time Putin has spoken about peace he has stepped up aggression.  If he is presenting a 7 point plan  expect a 7 point invasion plan and tanks rolling up to the border of Romania and Poland by the end of the year.   ..Also love the bending over backwards by the world community to not call it an invasion so that the treaty to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity doesn't get challenged.  Obama and the media will call it tinkle toes when the tanks roll through Kiev but not an invasion.,"I like the unwavering support of nato. What had that been worth, what if anything does that mean moving forward? Literally I'd say is as good as wet tp.  At this point it is clear the west won't do anything and if putin was smart he will just keep this up until he invades all Ukraine.  He will use had to cut off heat infiltrate kiev and stir up protest over the winter and roll tanks in the summer as peace keepers. Wash and repeat with the baltics.  You think France or Germany will go to war over Lithuania?  No way. If anything putin is a fool if he doesn't keep going.","Did you read the article?  Direct quote  Ukraine has the unwavering support of NATO.  Full stop sir.  So again what support does that entail?  Don't give people false hope.  We know the NATO isn't going to do anything, we know the West won't do anything and Europe won't do anything.  Semantics in this case.  Because no one is going to do anything but throw out empty rhetoric.  Don't promise these poor people hope if you aren't seriously contemplating it.  NATO could actually do anything it wants.  Was Kosovo part of NATO?  How about Libya?  What nations constitute Europe and the West in your mind?  Unless you are talking Switzerland I assume every member of Europe or West is part of NATO.  So yes they are the same. Again Putin is a fool if he doesn't keep the tanks rolling into eastern Europe.  Carpem Diem","The President of the United States has stated unequivocally that Assad must go. Mr. Putin wants an ally, like Assad,  to remain in power.  By engaging in Syria, Russia can improve Assad's position within any negotiated settlement.","The loud posturing and condemnation by the United States and its allies only serves to create a sense of patriotic isolation in Russia, a nation with a history of having its paranoia about the West validated by western behavior...Perhaps it would be better to respond by acknowledging that any powerful nation has the capacity to take action against a weaker nation and that it is self-restraint rather than forced restraint that prevents such attacks.  Portraying Russia as an over-reactive neighbor whose better nature could still come forth might be a tad better than threatening punishment which everyone knows that Europe and the US are not willing to mete out.  ..We should also acknowledge that if a nation invades its neighbor and is welcomed in the process, perhaps the claims of strong ties and the right to self-determination are in fact partially warranted, however unacceptable the actual invasion.  If the United States proposed a plebiscite to be administered in the Crimea about whether to stay in the Ukraine, become independent, or join with Russia, President Putin might welcome the idea -- because given a choice, the Crimea, which is not historically Ukrainian, would probably vote to become part of Russia.","The US had little impact on the end of the Soviet Union...the implosion was largely internal, and had Russia already developed the oil resources that have propped up Putin's regime, the USSR might well have survived.","Russia's next steps may well be:..- Reclaim eastern Ukraine.- Install a puppet regime in Kiev.- Send in troops to protect ethnic Russians in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.- Set up puppet governments in those states..I think that Russia will stop short of trying to annex countries that were not part of the USSR, but not for fear of the West.  Putin is likely to believe that the United States and Europe won't do anything that causes them economic pain, let alone serious loss of life.  ..If Russia is prepared to violate toothless international laws as Stalin, Hitler, Imperial Japan and Mussolini did in the 1930s, I don't see anyone stepping in to stop him.  Denying him a chance to attend a conference or voiding travel visas is not going to matter, and if a tiny minority in South Africa could resist international isolation for decades, it is hard to see a resurgent, embittered, economically significant and somewhat paranoid Russia knuckling under in the short run to a few minor economic and political punishments.","The loud posturing and condemnation by the United States and its allies only serves to create a sense of patriotic isolation in Russia, a nation with a history of having its paranoia about the West validated by western behavior...Perhaps it would be better to respond by acknowledging that any powerful nation has the capacity to take action against a weaker nation and that it is self-restraint rather than forced restraint that prevents such attacks.

The Cold War has given way to the Gold War between the free and the shackled, but rich,  states that make up the world.    Blaming these set backs on Obama is short sighted and lacks any real analysis.   Europe and the US do not have a long term cogent strategy for countering this challenge in the future.

Possibly the article could be fleshed out with relevant unfiltered data (which the news gathering staff - not to be confused with either the Editorial Board or the Head Lines writes of the NYT - are still world class at finding)..Their will always be Quislings who will embrace a heavily armed ethically untrammeled external power.

manfred marcus,,,,"Putin's Russia is at a crossroad, either join the community of nations, and help pacify the warmongers among us, or remain as a pariah in spite of its oil, which Putin misuses to control its neighbors and re-establish the hated subjugation of its prior satellites. The fact that East Ucranians speak russian is a lame excuse to annex territory, and to prevent stronger ties with the West. Poor russians, who have no say in their destiny, being bullied by an ex-KGB agent in search of past glory. Brute force to convince folks to join a discredited ex-soviet union is so 'out of fashion' that no credibility can be mustered. This, in spite of Putin's full control of a fake press, and veiled threats to any opposition, no matter how constructive. Any remaining democracy is hanging by a thread, in the intensive care unit but still oxigen-deprived and its pain unrelieved. Putin, if some conscience is left, ought to go home, and allow the long-suffering russians some respite. And their neighbors' as well. All or most of the main dictators of last century are gone, and we say good riddance.","Putin's aggression insofar Ukraine is concerned seems divorced from the dire economic condition he places on the Russian folk. It is as if he is on a personal mission to submit a nation unwilling to be subjugated. As such, the West ought to reach the Russian people to uncover the bully responsible for their predicament. What a waste of resources in favor of war,  and denied against all the evidence. Consider the reverse, a rational Russia, helping to build world peace while educating its diverse population to reach its potential. Possible only if grandiose stupidity is set aside. Putin's rising kleptocracy may contribute to this status quo, but  its eventual fall may occur when the long-suffering russians are pushed too far...and the truth  uncovered.","Concur with your assessment. Putin is a dangerous bully, full of insecurities, hence, the bravado to maintain himself in power; he continues to feed nonsense propaganda to its own people, with lies about his deep involvement of Russian troops in Ukraine, that cannot pass muster anymore. What a farse. That Putin would cut Russian supplies (gas and oil) if he could, of course; the only problem is, he depends on it for his own survival...rather than his interest in the welfare of his own people. My hat off to the Ukrainian folks, seeking freedom from even the memory of the abuse by the ex-soviet union that Putin is trying to resurrect. If the West (the U.S. and Europe) does not lend its full support (financial and otherwise) to Ukraine, it will live in ignominy  for not lending a hand when there was still time. And, hopefully, a soon to be putin-less Russia can rejoin the community of nations as an ally, and not a pariah...as a north-korean-like Russia would be a huge blunder, and totally unnecessary suffering of its people.","Putin is a hypocrit with grandeur delirium, actively supporting rogue russian groups to invade Ukraine, a sovereign country. At this point in time, it would be crazy to lift sanctions on Russia; the question is, is it making a difference to discourage brute force by the aggressor? And avoidance of further destruction of life and property? Perhaps those 'volunteers' do not hold a steady job, hence, ready for 'glory' by any other means. Stupidity seems limitless.","Putin's hollow victory about trying to subjugate Ukraine will definitely place him on the wrong side of history. He is a bully, and the Russians will suffer as a result. We have seen foolish self-aggrandizing 'pseudo-leaders' before, with awful results. What Putin needs is a gorbachev moment', to realize that carnage can be avoided if imperialism is kept in check, his area of influence much more valuable if he can find reciprocal interests alive, and sovereignty made reciprocal (would Russia ever tolerate being invaded? Not even Napoleon nor Nazi Germany had a chance), in other words, do not do to your neighbor what you wouldn't want others do to you. Simple enough. And true.","Putin's Russia is indeed long on illusion, the dream to have imperial influence at the time of people's assertion to independent thought and action...from a bully dictating verse and prose of how things ought to go, a pseudo-colonial attitude thought dead long ago. The reality of Russia's military prowess is in full display on Ukrainian territory, a muscled invasion denied by Putin and Lavrov, against all evidence...except for the russian people, fed with offfcial propaganda depicting the 'wicked' West expansion to its door, supposedly to give Ukrainians the chance for self-determination. Unfortunately, suspicions abound, as selfish interests by the West (Europe and the U.S.) are fresh enough to be remembered. Still, current ongoing diplomatic efforts ought to be the best, if not the only, alternative on the table. Meanwhile, Russia is being cornered by sanctions and by the coincident fall in its main export, gas and oil, to hopefully bring some sanity to its ambitions. Russia would do well noticing North Korea's pariah status, and pursue a more promising different avenue, join the community of nations, once again, in good standing and on the right side of history. And Putin's KGB experience of mistrust and suspicion notwithstanding.","Well said...but easier said than done, as everybody knows. Unless the U.S. is willing to offer more support (to be defined soon), the europeans will take the economic brunt of cutting off the relations with Russia; particullarly painful if russian gas and oil is stopped from flowing. Or if the price is raised.   On the other hand, Putin's hand can be weakened tremendously if the europeans plus the U.S. are serious, put a stop to imperial ambitions that would trample the freedom and independence of Ukraine. The separatists are probably too young (and naive) to remember the brutality of the ex-soviet union upon its satellites, the political trampling of even basic human rights, and the choking off of any progress and initiative by its own people. And now the rampant corruption of its oligarchy portends no good deeds for the foreseeable future.","Ukraine seems a barometer of relations between Russia and its european counterpart, with the U.S. a more distant player but with the keys locked on international finances. Oil is becoming a more reasonable commodity and also a barometer for diversification (this includes all oil-dependent countries) and democratization, so that strongmen (and they are all men) can loosen their grip in favor of human rights and inclusion of a healthy political opposition. For now, Putin's ego is in the way, a blinder that will backfire as his 'dependents' on oil bonanza feel the pinch. Although Putin is not an idiot, he would be smart to surround himself with people smarter that himself, people who have not lost common sense as yet.","The USSR fell apart not because Reagan intervened but for the worsening systemic internal struggles and a corrupt communist Party. Putin  knows all this, as he was the head of the KGB (at the time). Ukraine should try not to fall again in the hands of Russia, irrespective of the carrots offered; so, Yanukovych, its corrupt plutocrat, must go. Ukraine would benefit maintaining a relative independence by associating with both Russia and the European Union, the latter having the urgent matter of supporting the Ukraine in these trying times (before it is too late). Putin should be savvy enough to know that severing ties with the EU is not very smart. Russia needs Europe more than the opposite, so, not wise to sacrifice reciprocal benefits, peace and stability being essential for the economic ties that bind them.","Oil, and other natural resources, may be the downfall of any country, if its easy profits makes it complacent and stops developing people's talent, becomes dependent on others for its food and other usually locally produced 'goods' for survival and well-being. Oil has become, all too often, a 'black cloud' for its people, and allowing abuses of power, a kleptocracy to flourish, and the poor being excluded from the temporary spoils of abundance. Look not only at Russia, but Venezuela and some African countries, and also the Middle East, where middle age-like tribal chiefs (O.K., called kings sometimes) dispose for themselves what ought to, in strict justice, be shared with their people. Education and widely available information about all this may yet obligate the powers to be to share and even behave. Putin's arrogance and 'machismo' is but a cover for an insecure man in search of an evanescent sense of entitlement and glory. Not a nice picture."

Is Ukranian debt and the financial  blackmail its former president accommodated a sign of economic aggression in this chess game? A lot depends on whether the Western  bankers follow in the footsteps of American bankers like Prescott Bush who bankrolled Hitler's.ambitions to the detriment  of their own countries' interests.","Mr. Friedman please compare the US foreign debt of over 16 trillion dollars to Russia's negligible foreign debt. Also look at how just like the Olympics in 1936, Russia got world wide acclaim  a month ago as a host. We have little to ffer the peole of Ukraine to bail them out of their debt and failed economy. This all started with Putin offering 15 billion with little strings attached to bail them out. We offered 1 billion in aid and no discounted supply of natural gas..Putin has a right wing anti-US parliament that is backing   his resurgent nationalism and militarism just like Germany in the 1930s. Face it we got it wrong in Iraq. a former Russian ally  and we ended up humiliating the Russians by doing what they could not do in Afghanistan. Then we used NATO's defensive muscle to overthrow Ghaddafi  and we aided the opposition in Syria who turned out to be militants and Jihadists trying  to overthrow Assad only  to have it backfire on us. So in all this the Russians  are humiliated and concerned about US and NATO aggression in overthrowing pro-Russian dictators and governments. Now is payback time for the Russians as they bask in their glory after the Olympics just like Hitler was determined to get revenge for German capitulation in World War I after the 1936  Olympics.  Mr. Friedman underestimates the riches already amassed by Russia and its Oligarchs and the damage they could do to the world economy. What if they demand gold instead of US dollars?",Unfortunately Mr. Putin is following in the footsteps of Hitler- congenial host of the 1936 Olympics who promptly afterwards starting annexing neighboring territories  occupied by  Germans. We have reason to be concerned about  the pattern developing with Russia and the similarities to Germany in the 1930s. That is why NATO exists and it will have to  act forcefully in letting Russia know there will be consequences. Of course the Neocons will use this to justify spending us further in debt  with unnecessary military hardware. Russia has no foreign debt- that should be of further concern and allows it to spend as it pleases on military hardware..Together with China they could do more damage by calling our debt due tha any military adventures.So asinine program of the Neocon started by Reagan of outspending Russia with military hardware will not work this time..Again this is a test for NATO and not just the US. Libya should be a precursor for what NATO can accomplish.,,,,
Greg,,,,"This was a good event, an important event for both President Obama and President Putin to make their public cases to the US domestic audience and also the world. When refugees are WALKING to Europe from the mess in Syria and Iraq, then all the important players in the region and world, despite their differences, accept action is going to have to occur to bring remedy, and coordinated action is best so nobody is stuck with the entire bill and the forthcoming domestic political punches at home from acting alone in a place as complicated and long-term sticky as Syria. Putin cannot afford to go it alone anywhere, short of nucs. The US and it's allies want assurances on what Syria is going to look like, post Bashar. And Bashar is going to exit, at some point. SOMEONE in Syrian leadership has to be accountable for Syria today. Accountability starts at the top, fair or not fair has no bearing. Russia can keep it's long-term interests and friends in Syria, nothing wrong with that. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the Gulf countries, why have they believed a solution can be formed in Syria without Shia help and approval?  These countries had little influence in Syria prior to war there. It's desirable, but not rational. It appears all parties are talking and coming together, despite public posturing, on some kind of action path for ISIS and Syria. Why else would the French now be flying missions over Syria? Get right in there....","I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  Putin Derangement Syndrome (PDS) strikes again..One would think that the USA national security military industrial complex is filled with joy due to the wars in Foreverstan; in this case 'Foreverstan' refers to the entire middle east and not just Afghanistan.  These wars will literally go on forever, won't they?  When the last Muslim is dead, we will declare victory..Why use PDS to restart the Cold War?  It must be that certain elements of the USA national security military industrial complex feel slighted with all the emphasis on air strikes, drones, and counterinsurgency warfare.  I guess the main Army feels left out and so must shake the dust off its Cold War machinery?.And so the American public is to be assaulted with this newest threat to our existence?  And the 70 years of constant war since WWII merrily roll along.  What a great sadness.","The NYT and many others in the national security military industrial complex continue to be afflicted by PDS -- Putin Derangement Syndrome.  It would be sad for those afflicted, if of course the PDS was not yet another ploy by the 'complex' and its supporters to continue to instill fear into Americans and keep the cash and influence rolling in..Quick reminder.  The duly elected government of Ukraine was overthrown by Western puppets.  The elected president had to run for his life.  Russia should be expected to take an interest in its neighbors, particularly when that neighbor has nuclear weapons..And as usual in these 'complex' matters, in order to keep the cash and influence rolling in, the USA must cause innocent people to die and those remaining to be moved into refugee camps after having lost their homes and businesses..How about something new?  How about if the American people said 'enough', refused to be subject to fear and the PDS, and demanded that we stop the killling of innocent people?  If we really care about the Ukrainian people, then let us work to give the people there what they want; two countries, independent.  Let us spend money on helping their economies and not on killing and defeating PDS.","These are serious discussions ongoing with serious decisions forthcoming. There has been too much bad precedent (false statements about actuality on the ground) from Russia to date. Which means this is more President Putin's D-M to get to reasonable compromises more so than Ukraine, Germany, France, Poland or the United States. This summation comes from an American citizen who believed the State Department and Administration needed to provide President Putin with expanded patience and understanding given Russia''s core strategic objectives and history of culture, religion and kinship with the Baltics. Also, this talk-slant of the new Ukrainian government being facist in nature is something that would be totally unacceptable to the US and certainly Europe, given history. It's rubbish. This is more about two sides of the same country not getting along, for decades, not facism. So, it is Putin who must choose his way. The US and Europe must continue to hammer home none of us have long term strategic interests in Ukraine. However, if Ukrainians travel around Europe and decide they want great economic partnership with Europe and the US, if they like their experiences and what they see, then that should be their choice. It's not like new Russian money doesn't live in Europe also. We need a strong Russia for partnership on Iran, the Middle East, energy and space. Bad precedent leads to bad outcomes. Nobody accepts that.","The more President Putin drags this out while signing documents which to date have been meaningless on the ground the more he empowers the very part of Ukraine he states are unacceptable to have influence in developments, the far right so-called fascists-nationalists of the country who have never trusted him and will state I told you so. All of this SO FAR is self-perpetuating, by Putin. The Ukraine problems should have been negotiated, compromised and fixed months ago. Russia is not on the ground with people and weapons? False statement. Putin is not involved on the ground, so he is not a party to the war and can do nothing? False statement. Nothing but bad precedents to date. We are going to have to step up to the plate WITH EUROPE and remind the Russian people they are our friends, they remain our friends, and we have no long term interests strategically in Ukraine. However, their leadership must know that Ukraine is not Georgia. Ukraine is in the Baltics, northern Europe. While Bush 43 waved a big stick or promises to Georgia then did nothing, this is Europe.  Putin is losing the way of life economic decision making by Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Putin's chessboard stops here; otherwise European countries such as Moldavia, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and even Finland are going to FEEL the negative outcomes of having Russian state security operatives and influence hanging as a shadow right next door to them in Ukraine into the future.","I recently heard a lecture by Kimberly Marten, one of the leading specialist on Russian politics, who made an interesting point about Putin and Chess. You know, Putin doesn't play Chess on real life. According to Marten, he is not a strategist, but he does do a lot of Judo and he certainly is a tactician - always looking for a weakness that he can exploit. I think that this analogy holds true in this situation as well.","Here is another way to look at the situation. The Putin bashing seems like a version of Obama Derangement Syndrome to me. The downing of the airliner was obviously a terrible mistake. The ukrainian separatist who did it thought he was shooting down a ukrainian plane (if indeed it was not a ukrainian nationalist who shot down the plane - no proof either way yet). So the person or persons who did it should come forward, confess, and ask for forgiveness. This terrible incident is an opportunity to stop the carnage, not an opportunity to make it worse. Putin is not the devil.","What a disgrace this situation is and on all sides.  Rather than viewing this situation as cold war 2.0, we should shut our mouths and stay out of it (except for one item below)..The Ukrainian people are fools, like all people in such conflicts.  They are killing each other and destroying their homes and businesses.  What a disgrace and for what?.Chancellor Merkel (or the European Union or both) should step forward with President Putin and the two leaders of the Ukrainian and Russo Ukrainian factions immediately.  For once in this situation, they should speak for their suffering people and their futures rather than their own selfish points of view concerning their power.  Show some honor and bravery..Then Merkel and Putin can propose and impose a peace with lots of economic aid to rebuild the country.  Here is where the USA could help with some aid as well..There are no good guys here.  There are only evil people and their victims.  Stop the nonsense now.","One has to laugh at the fifth paragraph about the three great Russian ideas.   How about USA exceptionalism, devotion to Christianity, and belief in capitalism?  Mr. Brooks is always thought provoking, but how do these three Russian beliefs make the USA a better country?.America is the biggest hypocrite in the world, espousing itself and its beliefs and then acting differently.  I would say that those  in glass houses should be careful about throwing the first stone..Mr. Brooks and the New York Times continue their campaign to make Russia out to be some odd country and Mr. Putin some odd man, when actually couldn't it be the case that Mr. Putin reflects the will of the Russian people to protect themselves against yet another incursion from the West?.But if that isn't a good enough point of view to cool the jets of the NYT and its russophobia, how about the practical needs of the USA for alliance with Russia concerning Syria, Iran, and North Korea?.Enough of the superiority complex please about Russia.  Let's examine ourselves in the mirror of the Russian behavior and act accordingly.","One has to laugh at the fifth paragraph about the three great Russian ideas.

We have methodically started a new Cold War with Russia, trying to circle Russia with military bases and missiles and vilifying Russia for any resistance. Georgia launched an attack against Ossetia and Russian peacekeepers in Ossetia, on the Russian border, and we immediately began to vilify Russia for responding, even though the response was necessary to protect Ossetians and Russian peacekeepers and the response was measured. Now, we have encouraged a coup in Ukraine, a coup that is wildly anti-Russian, and we are further vilifying Russia for being concerned with Russian heritage people along the Russian border...New York Times columnists write of President Putin in the most inflaming terms, terms that further encourage an American military stance against Russia. I do not understand. We went to war needlessly in 2003 and have been at war ever since and yet entertain the prospect of a widening deepening war.

Friedman..ZURICH  Last March, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was quoted as saying that Russian President Vladimir Putins attack on Ukraine, supposedly in defense of Russian-speakers there, was just like what Hitler did back in the 30s  using ethnic Germans to justify his invasion of neighboring lands. At the time, I thought such a comparison was over the top. I dont think so anymore. Id endorse Mrs. Clintons comparison purely for the shock value: It draws attention to the awful things Putin is doing to Ukraine, not to mention his own country, whose credit rating was just reduced to junk status...... From the title on down, I find this essay shockingly prejudiced and inflaming of American opinion against Russia and especially against the President of Russia.  Beginning with inflaming analogies from the 1930s on down to the description Putin the Thug, the essay offers no fair analysis.  How sad and frightening.","Having thought this essay through carefully again, I find the vilification of Russia and President Putin as a reflection of Russia to be completely unreasonable.  This essay strikes me as an exercise in prejudice, and as such simply scary.","President Putin has repeatedly asked for a ceasefire in Ukraine, while the Kiev government has repeated refused a cease fire.  There must be a ceasefire and negotiation with the ethnic-Russians of eastern Ukraine for there to be a stable Ukraine.  The United States should support a ceasefire and negotiations.","The takeover of the Stasi headquarters was relatively peaceful, but in Mr. Putins mind the crowd was frenzied, deranged and dangerous, and the experience that night haunted him like nothing else in his mostly undistinguished career as an intelligence officer...... A ridiculous assertion, as though the writer were relaying what Mr. Putin had told him as therapist for Mr. Putin.  All that this sort of analysis does is take us further from understanding the Russian President.","From the opening sentence on, this is psychological pretense.  How could this writer know what Vladimir Putin was thinking on a given night in 1989?  Shockingly pretentious and meaningless analysis."

What an embarrassment this president is.","The Russian commentators here have no benefit--literally--no mass media that isn't tightly and absolutely controlled by the Kremlintsar Vladimir Putin. In this regard it is no wonder Putin has high approval rates: there is no media opposition.

Putin the rogue leader of Russia is using deceptive tactics to invade Ukraine in the guise of separatists. Countries that border Russia and formerly of it's orbit with significant Russian language speakers are being subjected to Russian subversive ideas to foster separatist movements that Russia can exploit and occupy with ease. Fortunately the perfect storm of economic sanctions with teeth and the biggest knife to Russia's economy, plummeting oil prices with the Saudi are employing to kill off market share of others including Russia by not cutting production to raise prices. In theory Ukraine benefits because it temporarily lowers it's fuel costs supply from Bulgaria and it's benefactors in Europe where fuel is so expensive. But as Mr Friedman asserts, the Europeans are not fully appreciating what is occurring in Ukraine, is that Europe's security is being compromised with Russian incursions into Ukraine. When will Europeans wake up to the fact that Russia through Ukraine and potentially bulldoze through other border  countries to assert itself in western Europe? Are the Europeans blind, indecisive or plain stupid to not counter Russia's moves?",Mr Putin's bellicose aggression is a direct response to the West who alliances are weak or timid in confronting his provocation. He tests and probes beyond previous limits in tactics that confuse his opponents. He obviously has no regard for diplomatic exchanges that are honest means of communications and his promises are often shrouded in smoke and mirror results. ..Mr Putin is deploying psychological warfare on a global stage that put fear into his neighbors and his opponents with cheap talk about his country's nuclear capabilities through his subordinates. Surely there will come a time when he will fall on his own sword when his own people have endured enough sacrifices at home for the glory of Putin's vision of Russia.,"Putin set up this bloody defeat by excluding this city from the pact which contained Ukraine troops surrounded by Russian, equipment and Russian supported rebels.

The confusion and power vacuum in the immediate aftermath are clear evidence that his opponents didn't expect a change of government until after new elections were held.  Two months later, elections were duly held.","Yes, thank God we don't have a pro-Russian lobby in America that views Russia as a perpetual victim nation that therefore has a right to occupy its mean neighbors like Ukraine, and Lithuania and Finland.  Thank God we don't have a pro-Russian lobby that remembers the invasion by Nazi Germany but forgets the pre-war Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that dismembered Poland and permanently annexed a third of it to the Soviet Union.  Thank God we don't have to listen to justification of the slaughter perpetrated on innocent women and children by the victorious Red Army at the end of  WW II, the military occupation of neighboring countries like Chechoslovakia and Hungary and the brutal repression by Russia of their attempts at regaining political independence.  Thank God we don't have a lobby to tell us why it was wrong to deplore serfdom under the Czars, the enslavement and murder of millions of Soviet citizens for crimes of conscience and why it's wrong now to object to Putin's destruction of democratic institutions and suppression of dissent.","Clearly the rebels don't believe Putin's public pronouncements about tempering Russia's support for their movement.

Curiouser,,,,You have it backwards! Russia has not been invaded! Ukraine has been invaded! And Russia has admitted to aiding rebels on Ukrainian soil! It is Ukraine that needs to defend itself. Check your knowledge of history. Ukraine wants the modern era. Putin the KGB relic wants the Soviet Regime under his fist.,Fiction.  Putin supplies Russian weapons for the means to his own ends.,To say Putin cares about civilized norms of behavior is to exactly miss the point. He does not care. His power base erodes as Ukrainians leave his sphere of influence.,"For God's sake, all Ukrainians can speak Russian. They do not want or need rescuing! Don't buy into Putin's propaganda.  His statements are the Fox News of the region. Study history.  This insanity has been done before.","How naive some of you are. This is not aid! Forcing 260 trucks into a country uninvited? Come on now. Putin is never to be trusted. A circle of KGBs plot only for their own well being, not their neighbors.  Putin is terrified of Ukraine aligning politically with Europe. He wants to resurrect the Soviet Empire. That is no aid package philosophy !","How naive you are. This is not aid! Forcing 260 trucks into a country uninvited? Come on now.

He plays games with lives. He does not care about humanity one iota.",Not similar at all. Ukrainians are not and would never bomb their own people. They were invaded by Russia. You would do well not to believe Russian propaganda. They have been lying for a very long time. Putin wants more land! He will say anything to get it. He does not want Ukraine to align itself with western Europe.,"Compromise? They were no pro-Russian protesters. The area was taken over by disguised Russian military! Putin has been consistently lying about why he would attack more of Ukraine.  This is a power and land grab by a Soviet psychotic dictator, and Ukrainians are just in his way. There are no two sides fighting. There is a former KGB officer attacking Ukraine because his puppet president ran from office. Putin is a killer in the style of Stalin. He will kill to enlarge his empire. How dare Ukrainians want to band with Europe? No matter. The West doesn't care. No oil to be had.","Many Ukrainian-Americans have family (at least cousins) in Ukraine. It is our blood that would be spilled. Face it, Putin wants to raid Ukraine to force them to defend themselves and then state the thugs behind masks (Russian forces) are in danger. But it has never been about Russians in danger. It is about Putin's egomaniacal thrust toward power and resurrection of the nightmare Soviet regime. He would have nothing without the resources running in the pipelines under Ukraine.  KGB never becomes human. This world would be a better world without oil and gas hoodlum regimes everywhere."
R. Karch,,,,"Mr. Friedman's blatant support of wars fought to establish American pseudo-values throughout this beleaguered planet ... will be rued, ...   and if there is any world left, as we knew it.,  not knocked out by atomic holocaust..It will be regretted, even more than his blatant support of the war upon Iraq, a victim nation set upon by ruthless and impetuous leaders here..The pattern has been clear.   Denounce a 'dictator', then prepare the soil, cultivate the people by repeating over and over accusations and one-sided arguments.  Get all countries to agree, if possible, and most will, ingratiating the superpower status of the U.S..And all the better to then pinpoint and declare as rogues any holdout nations.

To make us succumb to its influence..No one has ever managed to achieve this aim in relations with Russia or ever will, he added, to applause from the audience, ....ITAR-TASS news agency reports.","Putins use of Russian troops wearing uniforms without insignia to invade Ukraine and to covertly buttress Ukrainian rebels bought and paid for by Moscow is the ugliest geopolitical mugging happening in the world today.  Friedman wrote..Who started this?  Putin claims it was the U.S., and NATO, who have made the Ukraine into a NATO proxy.  This is worse than just humiliation for Russia...SEE <a hrefhttp:www.bloombergview.comarticles2014-10-24 titlehttp:www.bloombergview.comarticles2014-10-24 targetblank>http:www.bloombergview.comarticles2014-10-24<a>.putin-says-dont-mess-with-mother-russia.The U.S., according to Putin, is a global Big Brother that blackmails and bullies its allies while producing instability and misery around the world. Because the U.S. realizes it no longer has the ability to succeed as the lone hegemon in an age of rising powers, it is trying to recoup that status by re-creating the Cold War and producing a new enemy against which to rally countries, he said...Yesterday, I worried about Syria:.the US opened itself to ineluctable discredit, having first denounced al-Assad August 18, 2011, joined by certain European leaders. The sooner it makes  pronouncement that indicates it sees conditions have changed and is no longer so emphatic as to when Assad should have to leave. and the govt changed, and not insisting the govt. be changed according to its own self-interested-only prescription for that ...the better...Subsequently other leaders, like Pres. Putin, are being denounced..Why does Mr. Friedman have to chime in with schoolboy-bully kinds of foreign policies?","At least Vladamir V. Putin knows it is sad what happened to the U.S.S.R..Our U.S. leaders accept no idea the U.S. ever really failed in anything it tried to do.   And so it keeps doing the worst things, like keeping the war in Syria going...Russia tried to help end that war.  That would have allowed Syria to focus on stamping out the worst terrorists like those in ISIS, who now have been triumphing.   But instead, the U.S. kept siding with opponents of the regime, so-called 'moderate' rebels.     So Syria had its hands full trying to fight both the rebels supported in a useless war against Syria, and the ISIS fighters.  Those could be left to the areas they were enabled to run over.  The U.S. and allies thus caused this horrendous outcome:  the rise of a new Islamic State    ..Whereas Russia opposes rebels, the U.S., Israel, and other allies try to use them again and again, and they are not good 'compatriots' to be allied with.  America lost its ability to know how to coexist with any countries it names according to the whims of neo-conservatives, who usurped the CIA, Congress, the Executive Branch &amp; Department of State...But people in those countries don't go away, and a preponderating number of them were hurt by all the relentless war making, and DO NOT forget the horror, the suffering, the killing, so many having become fleeing refugees -- of their former numbers..This happened to Iraq. Pres. Obama was pressured into doing it then to Libya, unconscionably, then to Syria.","Even so, the one-time wunderkind, ... is convinced that the authoritarian, anti-Western system Mr. Putin has re-imposed will not prevail.  Mr. Kozyrev argues that most people are innately drawn to democracy ...  More than that, he contends that Russians are Europeans who have an affinity for the continents dominant religion (Christianity), culture and democratic traditions..However Russia has a right to be anti-West by standing against, and serving as a moral bulwark against, mistaken trends ...in 'the West', especially in the U.S..It seems paradoxical how this very country, Russia, that is being portrayed as anti-democracy', as to the way its government treats the Russian people, or the way the judiciary carries out unfair verdicts, or engages in extra-legal proceedings  ... actually seems to have a population freer from anti-religion indoctrination...We in 'the West' should recognize the fact there are forces that have been working, and for decades, against our basic religious heritage and any upholding of the kinds of morals and values they used to be capable of being at least respected for.  And, our democratic values, and the fairness of our own judicial proceeding, are possibly even in worse danger than in Russia today...Strangely enough, the very nations on this planet, where such propaganda has been working their successful agenda of replacing any moral forces, with forces that ingratiate atheist plutocrats, keep claiming their own hypocritical rightness.","There is much in today's column to quibble with.   Mr. Friedman at one point says: Let us not mince words: Vladimir Putin is a delusional thug..What is definition of 'thug'?     He keeps repeating various ways in which Mr. Putin doesn't measure up to the standards he thinks leaders should.  Yet Mr. Putin enjoys 80 approval rating from the Russian people!  ..Is Mr. Friedman trying to distract us from the fact Mr. Obama gets little over 40 approval from Americans?.And has Mr. Putin deluded his own people too, as well as having deluded himself?   At least he hasn't been killing thousands including many innocents and children, by use of drones.   Has not Mr. Obama been too trigger-happy?..A case is being made to do insult after doing much injury: the hurtful sanctions.  It's true Russia has been over-dependent on oil.  But so is the U.S., and Americans use up much more oil, per capita, than most other nations..It is shameful that any nation has to depend on oil, and then cause it to be wasted by selling it to people who waste it.   Mr. Friedman thinks we need a tax on gasoline.   (Such a tax should be refunded to people who can prove they have low assets or low income.) ..That would be a good thing, and the tax money received should also go for fixing or replacing the crumbling infrastructure.  It would be a small price to pay for both reducing outrageous consumption of oil, and helping save the country for the future.","Mr. Friedman as much as said Vladimir Putin lost his marbles'.  This is an overtly childish thing to say..Where anymore are our ambassadors of good will?  The U.S. generally cultivates friendship of only cheapest kind, namely friendship only to nations that believe in the very same kinds of values the U.S. professes..There is no tolerance for differences.  Such is the nature of autocratic kinds of systems of values.   Could that be. what American values are coming to?  There is scarcely any openness here, no ability or willingness to have open and tolerant discourse.  We seem to know it all...Shamefully, though America supposedly had presumed for  itself an elevation of the value of tolerance, this has been debased most thoroughly into what amounts to closed-minded intolerance, a total unwillingness to accept differences.   And journalism most unfortunately often just expresses the devolution and degradation of our system of values, and too often frankly amounts to a drumbeat for intolerance and willful misunderstanding.   ..Yes, it belies an adamant refusal to see  common basis, any trace of common good, between the holier-than-thou presumption of knowing all that's true and important, ... and the miserable failures of anyone else on earth who may beg to differ on something.   ..And nothing but lame excuses are trotted out time and again, to try to justify these antithetical stances against those who don't become 'yes men' to our own brand of justice, peace, or democracy.",,,,

At this point why is BO even taking Putin's calls?,I did read the article and I'm aware of the problems the EU is having over the Ukraine.

All the Great Leaders know this, so why be surprised Putin's making moves?.The EU and IMF and ECB could restructure loans wo any of the banks involved being hurt..BUT that's against all the laws of capitalprofitrent-seeking regardless the human cost; ugly times we are living in.","Putin and Xi are making important deals. We're forcing Putin into other arenas by sanctions and double standards (we can do it, you can't re breaking NATO promises etc)..That's why I hate this aggression on our part, surrounding a proud (nuclear) Putin with weapons on his borders. Always works.I fear this buildup is being done at Israel's behest, which won't be stated or discussed openly. No one wonders why we don't believe our Neocon warmongers anymore, they've been too wrong too much. Using NATO as the front to save Moldova, Armenia---really? Anyone with friends who have family in Poland, Romania et al will hear no one's talking about Putin coming in, let alone worrying about it..Once again a new &amp; bigger war comes packaged as something else..Roger I usually love your columns but this one sounds like a plant by someone at the Pentagon or CIA. A Jack D. Ripper who loves the idea of a nuclear arms race or long warm war.","Ukraine is going to find out what being poor really means. Nobody's really supporting them, ever since Victoria Nuland and co (us) sowed seeds of the maidan in Kiev and Ukrainians are now reaping the whirlwind..Are we really poking the bear out of anger at BRICS creating their own IMF and figuring a way to do business around the dollar? Putin hasn't been acting hair-on-fire crazy yet our media is drumming so hard against him I'm  suspicious. NATO's readiness up. Power chess is a bloody, dastardly game.","I was with you until the last sentence. Putin clearly understands his country but I'd say he (and they) will endure anything to end the Big Bad West's endless power maneuverings..Russia becoming more self-reliant in all sectors is what we should be doing. Instead we seek profit anyeverywhere but don't care about home. Putin sees capitalism in its tertiary stage, cannibalizing itself, and is waiting it out. He's not going to have to do that much, watching us continue our unwinnable wars everywhere while citizens at home fill the streets protesting police brutality and unequal treatment in our nation of Exceptionalism.. Our demonizing of him &amp; Russia this time has many antecedents in my lifetime. It's a tired script. Surely we could have done better if only when we learned our role in Crimea escalation via V. Nuland. We're asleep..He's wily and seasoned, far from delusional..He's been useful getting Assad to hand over chem weapons and coming up with pact for Ukraine on a napkin to stop NATO action. These are a big power's savvy moves against big powers. He may call on Russia's former greatness but he's 100 forward looking to Russia not needing the West. Why wouldn't he strongly feel that way?","This hard position on Assad has always been driven by the Saudis (and Turkey). Why we have to stay beholden to Saudi is insane, given they are funding many of the non-ISIS rebels. Well too bad. Putin doesn't care and is bombing them. He's got a port to protect and ally to support..Good. Go for it, Russia..Kerry is trying to keep Europe out of the peace talks on Syria---again to give leverage to Saudi and Turkey re Assad. Seriously. This should be another P51 dealing with ISIS, not another push to put our favored 'moderate' in to deliver democracy to this demolished country. Europe is certainly involved re Syrian refugees. Democracy will not break out in ME, ever. Face reality..Our attempts to control it all have become farce..Putin's UN speech was a splash of reality..Let's just hope Russia's plan works in damping ISIS. Assad is likely better than whoever we'd put in his place. See: Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam....Our military needs a new direction. And not just selling weaponry to anyoneeveryone..Putin wants to stop ISIS from showing up on his doorstep, and he wants credit for helping an internat'l crisis. Let him give it a go..Our military experts quoted here got us into this mess. Stop quoting them for awhile and let's see what happens.  It can't be worse than what we've done in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria.","Putin's just shown his true colors with the crash site being blocked for days. Don't diss the European leaders' statements let alone the Dutch. They are attempting to survive during Austerity and can see the US engaged in war of some kind all over the world. Many Europeans see the US as being very hawkish after Iraq and lost trust in US ability to help them avoid war. In spite of Obama, they hear the rhetoric &amp; know we have more bases &amp; troops &amp; weapons than any  of countries.  We can be perceived as bullies too. The Europeans have had 2 World Wars on their continent and don't want another, at any cost.  Putin's narcissism has been wounded so be cautious around a sociopathic bear.","Sorry to see this whole thing dismissed because author is from Moscow. He has some important things to say..Our CIA neo-cons pushed Kiev at that time and place to overthrow their elected leader, something we have a long history of doing.  But Putin isn't a tin-pot dictator &amp; sees exactly what we're doing. We're surprised to see NATO aggressively expanding? He isn't..Looking over many decades of our interventions virtually everywhere this is same but with a different kind of leader, a strongman who considers the destruction of USSR as the worst event in world history. This is who we picked a fight with, over nat.resources..There's no discounting the fact that neo nazis were part of the Maidan and perpetrated atrocities on the Donestk population, with little reporting in our media. The shot-down by ? airliner came days after BRICS announced their new currency to avoid the dollar as world currency..Reading news out of other countries is important, what the people are saying, talking points aside. What's very clear is we are getting a limited view of events and it's very anti-Putin. I'm no fan of the man but the rundown of him has been similar to many others in my lifetime, recently Saddam but anyone who doesn't wholly buy our policies..The CIA is out of control, trying to control the world's resources..Russian citizens don't want war. Neither do Americans. But we're along for the ride.","If Putin withdraws the money he promised they should put up an online donor site for Ukraine. They'd raise millions fast, maybe even enough of a surplus to start over wo trampling on human rights?..Of course we raised millions in small donations for Obama but still are fighting like crazy against those that prefer repressive gov't, but so far no blood in the streets...","Turkey has been useless in fight against ISIS, keeps killing Kurds yet we, with NATO's voice, are up in Russia's face about this? We who go wherever we want and destroy any area we want with impunity?.Let Russia bring its troops into Syria. Let ISIS and other Sunnis wage jihad against Russia instead of us for awhile. Russia has a port to protect and Assad is better than whoever we'd try to install..This seems it should be good news. We need to leave and wish them luck..Articles like this sound like Russia bashing straight out of the cold war, right out of our military's tired playbook that's gotten us enmeshed in so many conflicts that are unwinnable but keep many in Big Money..Until facts prove otherwise, why aren't we glad Putin's trying to help against Daesh and also stop the refugee crisis?",

He would have said nothing - but he would have sent a battleship to the region! But at least he would have avoided rhetorical traps. That's the mark of an effective foreign policy, right?

But what if he really WILL follow up on the threats he is making - but only after all other measures are exhausted first? Diplomacy before force?! Perish the thought!!!!..Pundits appear to expect kneejerk reactions from our elected leaders, and seem to feel let down when it doesn't happen. Don't worry, there will be others like GWB.

You can expect our military to be all over this planet and involved in several intractable military junkets as a result.

Last I heard, he left the scene entirely. His palaces are now occupied by the people and they are taking in their eccentricities wondering, no doubt, how they could have politically supported such a megalomaniac...And, Putin being Putin, will do exactly the wrong thing and escalate matters. The Ukraine is an independent country. If Vlad wants a return to the soviet union, he should have thought about that pre-1990. Too late now, Mr. Putin.  do the honorable thing, and the right thing for Russia, and resign.","There is a difference between the Vincennes involvement in the incident in 1988, and the Russian separatists' involvement in the current situation: The U.S. readily took responsibility, while the separatists are doing everything to dodge responsibility...This could have been avoided - had Putin and Russia not done anything to inflame tensions in Ukraine. But it's a little late for that now. What we need now is for those who were responsible to step up and do the right thing. Claim responsibility; empathize with the other factions in the country; prepare to negotiate and, most importantly, listen. And Putin should be ready to resist all temptation to meddle. Old habits die hard - for ex-KGB agents from the Soviet Era.","If you can't trust the entity that collects intelligence to drive our national security policy, then who do you suggest the NYT trust.

Putin is building a society based on local thugs, but there is no bigger message than nationality for the russians, no freedom, no prosperity. This is our chance, we have already gained so much, we don't have to get disappointed about not getting a little peninsula. Lets have Putin have his business in the crimea, we have business in the rest of the ukraine, let's focus on that.","Russians just want something durable to believe in, a vision that is worth fighting for. It's like nietzsches 'last man' against the 'bermensch', and we are the last man, the inextinguishable hedonists. The issue in my opinion is, has Putin a vision or is he just distracting..For someone (like me) who believes, Putin is just distracting, russians therefore just seem desperate wayward.","Merkel is stilled angry about the NSA, and about Nulands 'F Europe' comment.

Victor,,,,"So many of these commentors seem to assume that Russia is a powerful nation. It is not. Putin and his cronies are fighting back against the tide of collapse that began well before Reagan and Gorbachev. In its current incarnation, Russia is a Petro-State, and similar to most other Petro States, rife with corruption. Its manufacturing sector and innovation sector's are basically nill. While it leads the world in oil production, and that is certainly important, its total is not much greater than that of Saudi Arabia or the US. That production is important to Europe, but so what? Our US economy is eight times greater than that of Russia. The US and the EU combined economies are sixteen times great than Russia's. As all good Americans and free-market capitalists know, money talks and noboby walks.  I won't embarrass person's speaking aboutstrong-RussiaPowerful Putin by bringing to their attention the current life-span of your average Russian, compared with a citizen of the US or EU. Putin is prancing around, taking over Crimea, while ignorant of the fact that he is already a has-been. Anybody out there can name the leader of any other Petro State? Quick, can you name one? No big deal really. I vote that Obama and Merkel totally stand their ground.","Mr Putin seems to have two choices.  One is to turn inward, reject external links to western culture, deepen the lack of confidence in capital investments and slug it out into the future by the lonesome Russian self; or go back to the integration with the rest of the western world, become an integral and equal player on the global scale and enjoy the fruits of unconcerned capital inflows.  ..One is the road Russia already once adopted and it failed.   The second one lifted Russia out of its desperation into a path of prosperity...However, nothing comes from nothing and each choice involves compromises - some not to the liking of the Russian pre-established xenophobic mindset.   Get over it Russia and come and dance with the rest of us!","Mr. Putin issued a brief statement early on Monday saying that Russia would work to ensure that the conflict in eastern Ukraine moved from the battlefield to the negotiating table. He said that a robust international investigating team must have secure access to the crash site, but also accused unspecified nations of exploiting the disaster in pursuit of mercenary political goals...Mr. Putin must be losing his mind - the only mercenaries involved are the so-called rebels - all Russians, with Russian support, with Russian missiles, with Russian guns and Russian mentality - personally supported by Mr Putin and his Orthodox nationalistic buddies who dream of the re-emergence of a Russian-centric glory to the world..","Mr. Puting is demanding to see the proof from Washington that the missile shot down the plane?   How about  Mr. Putin proving, based on Russian radar information that he did not?    Or is it that suddenly Russia had NO radar coverage of the affected area?",The only real humanitarian aid Putin can offer is to pull his troops away from the border and renounce the terrorists in eastern Ukraine.,"Mr Obama and Mr Kerry beliefs as to what happens in the 21st century and what constitutes 21st century behavioral or political norms are naive.   There is no magic line separating imperialistic instincts of human behavior exhibited by Russians and possibly others in the regions.   These instincts were in the play for centuries before, at great human cost, with the consequence of conquest in the drive to control.   This is no different.  It is actually sad that the allusion the the 21st century expectations completely conveniently ignore historical perspectives, even when they are invoked by Mr Putin.   Mr Putin - when, why and how did the Tsars came to own the Ukrainian territory?   And then why would that lay a claim to any ownership rights that that part of the world? Would you care to explain that to the world?","The easiest and safest way to free Crimea and stop any other Russian aggressive acts against Ukraine is to make a list of 5000 Putin's top supporters and oligarchs, make it public, and then randomly ban for life ten persons daily from ever entering the USA, fifty-three countries members of the Commonwealth, and the European Union. ..Miraculously and without any other military escalation from NATO, Russia will stop and then reverse its Ukrainian activities and gains.",I think most readers are missing the point of my post...And the point is that ALL 5000 Putin's top supporters and oligarchs will get scared almost to death of being among the first ones banned for life from enjoying their billions...ALL 5000 of them will immediately push Putin to concede. Putin has been ruling only because of their support. And Putin will have no choice but to become more or less a normal human being.,"There are still obvious diplomatic openings to resolve this crisis as long as someone is willing to explore them.  So far the mano a mano Obama vs. Putin talk in the media suggests a preference for lots of fire but no light. ..Russia's incursion for now is territorially limited to its main strategic interest, its naval base in Crimea. It's refusal to recognize the present Ukrainian government is logical under the circumstances. After all, their was a coup, albeit of a corrupt president, but a democratically elected one.  And there was a power sharing agreement signed between the protestors and the government that was immediately abrogated by the opposition. Going back to that agreement, even as a simple framework leaves room to negotiate a settlement of this crisis. Right now both sides are in an all or nothing posture...Ironically even before the Russian incursion the western media warned of a possible break up of the Ukraine given its ethnic makeup and the fact that few from the eastern regions participated in the protests...Finally while the talking heads of our own media are shocked and outraged they quickly forget how the US asserted its interests when we invaded the Dominican Republic, Grenada and Panama to say nothing of waging proxy wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador. None of these countries posed the strategic threat to US as the loss of the Black Sea port does to Russia.  Let cooler heads prevail.","President Obama threatens Russia and Putin that the US will join the rest of world in condemning their actions! Like they care? What a joke. Putin is viewed by some as the most powerful leader in the world. Part of his success is that he doesn't give a damn about words. He just acts. In another place and time, in a fantasy, the US might act swiftly and strongly to counter Russia's moves. How about flying planes right into that airport in the Crimea, challenging Russia straight up to. That would be strong action.....not something our current President is capable of."

If Putin really believes that the Maidan protesters are terrorists and neo-Nazis then he is delusional and, as Angela Merkel described him, in another world.",The Red Fox logo on Putin's coat is telling.,The Red Fox logo on Putin's coat is telling.,"I disagree with many of the comments today...First of all, I do not believe that this is a neocon-manufactured crisis. To be sure, the US may well have been covertly supporting the Maidan freedom fighters -- I certainly hope so -- but a growing distaste for Russian domination has been brewing in Ukraine for a long, long time -- since way before neo-cons even existed. I don't believe for an instant that the Heavenly Hundred gave their lives for a CIA-backed plot. They made the ultimate sacrifice for their country out of a deep sense of patriotism and complete outrage at the government. To suggest otherwise is ridiculous.   ..Secondly, I do not believe that the progressive imposition of sanctions makes the US and EU look weak. Would those who disagree prefer WWIII? Of the available options, sanctions are the best, most effective and non-violent way to influence Russian behavior and I think that ultimately they will work. Tightening the noose even further could well lead to the collapse of the Russian economy. Could Putin's regime survive that? I doubt it and I'm sure that survival is at the top of Putin's list of priorities.","Putin's Russia spent 51 billion on the Sochi Olympics for many reasons, but one of them was surely to improve the image of Russia in the world.

They got rid of Kuchma and now Yanukovich. Invading Ukraine would of course not change their minds about Russian domination -- far from it. It would only make matters much, much worse. ..Putin may be many things but he is not stupid. I don't believe that he wants terrible relations with Ukraine. It's not in Russia's interest. I suspect his main concern is the future status of the Russian naval base at Sebastopol. That is a matter that could be resolved through negotiation with the new Ukrainian government. Remember, the United States has had a naval base in Cuba (not exactly a friendly country) for about a century.  The Sebastopol base could be the subject of a similar lease. ..There are ways for reasonable people to resolve these issues for the betterment of both Ukraine and Russia.","Putin's support for putting off the referendum shouldn't be taken seriously. As Chivers put it in his tweet, Games within games. Remember: Putin is very smart and a complete liar. He wants the farcical referendum to proceed but he doesn't want to be associated with it for a number of reasons. First the majority of eastern Ukrainians are not in favor of succession, second, Putin wants to be seen as in favor of a peaceful solution (to a war that he of course started). The truth is the first casualty in a war..I think you are absolutely right that we need to impose more and more economic sanctions on Russia until Putin gets the message, and most importantly, we need to be working right now, night and day, on alternative gas supplies not only for Ukraine but for Germany, the Netherlands, etc. If there is one good thing about this mess, it is that Russia's designs on Western Europe through dependence on gas have been completely unmasked. Can we seriously believe Putin the Liar that gas supplies to Western Europe will never be disrupted no matter what? Only a fool would fall for that.","We signed a treaty in 1994 to uphold the security of Ukraine. The idea that we can forget our obligations and just stay out of this conflict is therefore a non-starter. Unless the United States and the EU, especially Germany, impose very harsh sanctions on Russia for the Crimean invasion, we can expect Putin to try the same kind of land grabs in the Baltic states, in Poland, etc. And he will keep it up until he gets his fingers burned. Putin is clearly playing by the old Soviet, Cold War handbook that everyone over the age of sixty remembers all too well: commit some act of territorial aggression and lie like a rug. He needs to be stopped now lest he get the wrong idea about what parts of Europe belong to Russia.","If Putin's land grab of Crimea isn't reversed, what are we going to do the next time he grabs a piece of land that doesn't belong to Russia? To do nothing will only embolden him, and European history has shown that, once a tyrant like Putin gets started taking over territory, it's Katy bar the door. The Crimean invasion really raises the specter of pre-EU Europe, which in a nutshell is more-or-less non-stop warfare as far back as you care to go. Or would the isolationists, who somehow think that the United States can just walk away from our 1994 treaty with Ukraine, prefer to wait until the Soviet Union has been reestablished before we start pushing back? And if the United States is so spineless as to let that nightmare happen, who says Putin would stop there? Eventually, a guy like Putin, if left to his own devices, will one day see the need to protect the ethnic Russian population of Brighton Beach. Ukraine gave up the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons based on our security guarantee. If you think failing to enforce the red line in Syria hurt our standing in the world, just wait to see what happens to the reputation of the US  and to the former Soviet Union if we walk away from this treaty.","Putin's Russia spent 51 billion on the Sochi Olympics for many reasons, but one of them was surely to improve the image of Russia in the world.

Russell,,,,"This is very simple. When the phony referendum takes place on Sunday, then Putin will say it was the will of the people in Eastern Ukraine, and claim that Russia had nothing to do with it, given his recent insincere suggestion that the referendum be postponed...His troops aren't being withdrawn to any training grounds, as there were no training grounds on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine in the first place. He knows that it will take a few days for conclusive satellite data to be published...The situation will continue to deteriorate because the Ukrainian army unfortunately cannot hold any of the buildings that they temporarily take back...Supplying more rubber bullets for effective riot control would not constitute lethal aid, and would be a constructive addition to the the recent augmented nonlethal aid (radios etc.) recently announced by the Pentagon.  The Russians have sent lethal aid, including ground to air weapons that were used to shoot down Ukrainian helicopters. As Carl Bildt (Sweden's foreign minister) tweeted, some elderly Ukrainian ladies must have purchased some rocket launchers at the local supermarket. ..When the real election is held on May 25th, the pro-Ukrainian voters in Eastern Ukraine will be too frightened to come out to vote, and the pro-Russian voters will boycott the Presidential election. Then Putin will claim that the Presidential election was not legitimate, but that Russia supposedly did not interfere with it. Dark days ahead.","Last week the sanctions weren't enough. We went further. Still not enough, even if the Russian economy felt the effects. Putin put troops on the Ukrainian border. Obama looks weak because he had no reaction that the Russians feared. Now the ousting from the G8 is too harsh. Really? Listen to yourselves, people.","It's because they want Obama to fail. This country is so politically polarized that rooting for Putin supersedes supporting the US president, if that president happens to be in a different party from ours. It's very simple really: If Obama wins this showdown with Putin he looks good. That won't do for people like that. They'd rather Putin stick it to the West and make the president look weak. These people may be Americans, but I would not exactly call them patriots.","People are saying Obama should talk to Putin. Really? If he talked to Putin, the conservatives and Obama haters would criticize him for not doing more than just talking,( as if talking to Putin will solve anything, given his radioactive personality.)  Last week, the president was weak because he didn't have any tough sanctions. Now this action is somehow too drastic. I think the haters are secretly rooting for Putin to show the president up on the world stage. In other words, they are so politically opposed to anything Obama does, that even if he does what the haters want, they will find a reason to oppose the action. Very sad, indeed.","As much as I respect this reporter's general standard of excellence, this particular article evidences wishful thinking. In this global poker match, Russia still holds the ace card of its gas supplies. Although it is high summer for the moment, winter is coming, and Russia can squeeze much from Europe in four months. ..Also, the article lists too few sources to count as a general commentary on the pulse of Russia's business community. Russians love a strongman like Putin because real democracy is a tree with very shallow roots in Russia. They see Putin as someone who can get things done, and whether those things are good may be beside the point...Furthermore, France's cowardly supply of the two warships is problematic. It is true that parts of the ships were previously assembled in Russia, so this is not as clear cut as everyone supposes. Still, France should have at least delayed delivery. This situation is eerily reminiscent of the appeasement in Europe prior to World War II...Finally, President Obama's professorial approach so far has done little to deter Putin. If Russia reacts with escalated military aggression, will the President merely push some graduated economic response? Over analysis can result in complexity paralysis. If your opponent is convinced you will be too slow to meaningfully respond, then there is no deterrence. This really is a zero sum contest. It's fine to rule out a military response, just don't broadcast it beforehand. There is an art to bluffing.","The White House should head Mr. Navalny's words. He has shown enormous courage in speaking out while under house arrest, and faces a dictator's wrath for speaking out in this very articulate op-ed article. I only hope that Mr. Navalny will see better times. The Soviet, I mean Russian, habit of imprisoning and dealing harshly with dissidents is long and storied, although Putin omitted that from his recent, somewhat rambling speech...This is a credible sanction road map, written by someone who knows, that could make a real difference. This is not the time for western governments to hesitate, which only emboldens Putin more. ..Mr. Navalny wisely recommends including the Russian oligarchs who keep Putin in power, much like certain industrialists who played a similar role in Germany in the 1930's.  Our government has hesitated on meaningful sanctions. These sanctions are not a law school exam, graded by a law school professor. Rather, they are an important deterrent to prevent a much larger conflict in a couple of years. ..The version of Putin that the world is now seeing is the real ex-KGB colonel who believes that the breakup of the Soviet Union is some kind of catastrophe. More important, the swift execution of the Crimea scheme shows that Putin had planned something of this sort long in advance. Smiling and nodding at western leaders for years, telling Merkel what she wanted to hear for years, and then executing something that was planned long beforehand. A case Ukraine.","Increasing natural gas exports to Europe is a sound policy...However, throwing into a Putin-Ukraine article a quick pitch for gasoline and carbon taxes, to shift the demand curve, is like jumping off the deep end.  Using the same off the cuff logic on the supply side, you could also argue that phase IV of the Keystone Pipeline should be approved now to increase availability of crude to US refineries, and then make an off the cuff argument for increased fracking to increase the supply of natural gas and oil, creating a hypothetical oil and gas glut, and driving down prices.  ..The point is that containment of Putin's adventurism is not the best rationale for guiding energy policy.  The argument would prove too much, and could be an artificial rationale for all sorts of energy policies, all over the environmental spectrum.  Mixing apples and oranges...Incidentally, I do support phase IV, but it has nothing to do with Vladimir Putin or Ukraine.",,,

Dmitry Mikheyev,,,,"I don't think President Putin would need oligarchs' advice on such matters. In September 2008 I made a nostalgic trip to Theodosia (Eastern Crimea) and was amazed to hear stories about local residents heroic two-week stand against American warship's attempt to land and establish a NATO base in that port. They were actually building a memorial to commemorate the two-year old episode. It was Crimeans who were a principal driving force of the reunification. I have heard their dreams on the matter for years. When a year ago power in Kiev began unravelling with all the bloodshed etc, the Crimeans seized their chance, and I dont think Putin had much choice but to heed their pleas. But isnt it baffling that the US would need another navy base and where?","Those who blame Russia and Putin for the tragedy of Ukraine should consider several undisputable facts. Ukraine as a country was created by Lenin (who in 1920 gave it Novorossia), by Stalin (who attached Western Ukraine to it) and by Khrushchev (who gave it Crimea). In 1991 Ukrainian politico-economic elite inherited a country of fantastic potential  the biggest territory in Europe, sea, mountains, black soils, industry capable of producing largest airplanes, ballistic missiles, aircraft carriers, educated hard-working population of 52 million and GDP per capita higher than that of Russia. And what did Ukrainian elite do with this nascent giant? They turned Ukraine is one of the poorest countries in Europe with per capita GDP below that of Albania or Bosnia and only one-fifth of Russia. Ukrainian population has shrunk by some 12 million people, with five millions emigrated to Russia and Europe. The entire regions are running away. Are the Russians and Putin to blame for all this? Ukraine had received (according to Bloomberg) massive aid from Russia (some 250 billion) in the form of discounted natural gas, and Ukraines machine-building industry was kept alive by orders from Russia. While Ukraine has been plundered by crooked and criminal oligarchs, the West was luring it into NATO and EU and antagonizing against Russia. So who is to blame?","Once again I am impressed with the man -- Humanitarian Convoy is a very smart ploy in the battle for hearts and minds of Ukrainians (not just Russian Ukrainians). Lets face it, American and European NGOs made huge strides in antagonizing Ukrainians, particularly in the West, against Russia. I lived 10 years of my childhood in Ukraine and never experienced hostility as an ethnic Russian. Moscal was not a terribly insulting slur as it is now, and hang Moscals was unthinkable. So, instead of invading Ukraine with tanks and rockets and ruthless spetsnaz, Putin is showering Ukrainians with kindness. Compare this man's intelligence with that of another leader of another great state. I mean president Obama of course who talks about declining population (it stopped declining five years ago), says that Russia produces nothing (what about 2.2 trillion GDP?), insists on Putin's desire to resurrect the Soviet Union. Can a man uttering this sort of nonsense be called the most intelligent American president in a century?","This rocket scientist has a cognitive dissonance. I hate authoritarianism and am all for democracy. Yet I recognize Putin as one of the most intelligent and effective world leaders of our time. When I observe his annual press-conferences I stagger in disbelief: how could anybody handle 600 journalists (half of them foreign) for five hours without a single blunder? What he accomplished in 15 years is even more astonishing. He was appointed in September 1999 by then gravely sick Yeltsin. It was only a year after the default when Yeltsin bagged the US for pittance 5 bl. to save the budget. It was only three months after Bill Clinton whom Yeltsin called my friend bombed a Slavic brother-nation of Russia. More ominously it was the moment when army of 3,500 mercenaries invaded one Russian region (Dagestan) from another (Chechnya), and apartment blocks were blown up in Moscow and other Russian cities. He took a country that was falling apart and turned it into a relatively prospering state. Today an average salary (in ) is six times and GDP is 11 times greater than in 2000. Grozny, that looked like Stalingrad in 1943, is now a beautiful city with spunky skyscrapers and the rest. With all that, I cant even imagine how he is going to handle the Ukrainian crisis where radicals are threatening to overthrow totally impotent government and establish a neo-Nazi regime in the very cradle of Russian Slavic civilization. He certainly abhors war and invasion, but what are his options?","When the CIA Director John Brennan visited Ukraine and advised Kiev interim government to use armed forces against the rebellious East, I was puzzled. I assumed that as a professional military analyst Brennan knew perfectly well that 6 thousand poorly trained and equipped troops couldnt possibly subdue the region of eight million people. So what was behind his advice? To intimidate the rebels into submission -- such tough guys as miners, steel workers who had their homes and families to defend? Ridiculous. I dare to suggest that the true goal of American planners was to provoke a real bloodshed and the Russian army intervention. Putin is the last person on earth who wants a civil war four hundred miles from Moscow, but he would have had no choice if a carnage had begun as when Saakashvili began massive bombardment of Tshinvali in 2008. Fortunately, unlike Georgias NATO-trained troops, Ukrainians  the population, the army and even security forces -- all refused to kill each other. Nobody in Ukraine is eager to fight except for the militants of Right Sector. They continue to harass, intimidate and kill, like last night in Slavyansk, but they lack capacities for launching a full scale civil war. I am sure that after Chechnya Putin hates even to think about invasion of such a huge country as Ukraine. Hence, sending advisers to E. Ukraine to help them get organized and defend themselves appears a very sensible strategy leading to negotiations and compromise.","Gracchus, you are right, Putin and Russians crave for revival (after Bolshevism) of cultural and religious Slavic civilization which is distinct from the Anglo-Saxon one. Slavic Orthodox culture is worm, inclusive, forgiving, has no racial-religious superiority complex built in, rejects social Darwinism and doesn't have the idiocy of Armageddon and eternal frying. Among Russians you wouldn't hear one bad word about Ukrainians, only sorry for their suffering and pain. Benderovtsi are indeed considered different. But Putin offered and Zakharchenko agreed that even they could be spared and go home to their moms. Anglo-Saxons with their doctrine of Vernichtungskrieg (war of extermination) are simply incapable of such generosity.","Yes! And this is why Anglo-Saxons will never understand the role humiliation and wounded pride have played in Russians unparalleled resistance to the Nazis and the meaning of the current resurgence of Russia. The NATO encroachment into Slavic civilization till it reached its very heart was as humiliating as the Nazis overt plan to enslave or execute all of Untermenschen. In fact Anglo-Saxons arrogance was even more painful to Putin and Russians that that of Nazis because it was going with friendly smiles, back-patting and all the sweet talk about integration, freedom and prosperity. What Putin is doing is the restoration of the Russian peoples dignity, and the US should be VERY careful not to laugh too loud.","As victors, Anglo-Saxons could never grasp the extraordinary power of an emotion of humiliation, why, for example, China is still driven by memories of century of humiliation. The older generation of Germans also knows how unfair toward Germany is history written by A-Ss and is hurt by continuous humiliation. Not just aftermaths of each WW but 287 military bases and installations which keep Germany down, as Condoleezza Rice quipped. So f--k EU (Germany)..In 1914, the British empire wanted to stop Germany from getting too big and strong. Todays hegemon, after having eliminated all empires, wants to stop Russia and China from challenging its World Order. Hence all these efforts to marginalize and surround Russia through relentless expansion of NATO and EU. Even before Ukrainian crisis demonization of Russia and Putin by the west has been unprecedented. The image of Russia as weak, corrupt, misguided nation, the world's most corrupt mafia state ruled by a dictator, fascist, tyrant, a strong-arm mafia godfather has been cultivated for two decades. Still, despite all of that Putin is a strong leader presiding over a once again strong and confident country. Thats why he is hated &amp; demonized. A-S should finally learn what Germans did hard way: when Russians feel badly humiliated and realize they are cornered they fight to the last drop of blood and invariably win. This is why older Germans respect &amp; admire Russians and arent eager to be part of A-S drung nacht Osten (sp?).","The US should be told to mind its own business. Stop treating us Europeans as unruly teenagers. Ukraine is an exclusively European problem, and we (Ukraine, the EU and Russia) can handle it without both your cookies and aircraft carriers, thank you. But of course who exsept Putin has the guts to say this to the hegemon?","The US should be told to mind its own business. Stop treating us Europeans as unruly teenagers.

bongo,,,,"It is remarkable that the overthrow of a Democratically elected government has led to the strengthening of Nato.  Why could not the West, i.e., just wait for the next round of elections?  History will record, in the future, how the Ukrainian goverment came to be toppled in a violent coup.  Everything that follows is a result of that event.  Putin is made out to be the aggressor, in the U.S. press, always, yet he did not react with militery assistence until the Eastern Ukranian seperatists were about to be anniliated by Western Ukranian troops sent to Eastern Ukraine by the newly elected President. The reasons why the West felt compelled to act in their direct involvement in the overthrow of the Ukranian government are the same reasons that drive the expansion of Nato now, and they have nothing to do with freedom, which is a secondary or perhaps tertiary motivation.  Therein lies the truth of the Ukranian conflict, of which it content has not been written in the mainstream press, such as the N.Y. Times, among others.","If I am not mistaken, it was the U.S. State Dept. that planned and put forth the overthrow of the democratically elected gov't. of the Ukraine.  The former President, as corrupt as all the oligarchs are, refused to accept the terms of the loan agreements that were attached to the signing and entered at the last of the E.U. trade entry agreement.  So the west moved and overthrew the Gov't.  The State Department did this.  It is said that the number two person in the free Ukraine is Poroshenko and the number one is the U.S. Ambassador.  Putin reacted quickly to this threat, and it was and is to Russian territorial and strategic interests, by securing Crimea.  Unwisely, Poroshenko sent Ukranian troops into Eastern Ukraine instead of diplomats, of which there were none.  And let us not forget the openly hostile and threatening comments coming form all important heads of state and from Nato and directed to Russia during this same time period.  So, now we have a clue as to who was one of the instigators for the State Dept's. misadventure and possibly the beginning of a very serious conflict.  Oh and let us not forget about the frailty of the E.U. economy and how all this weakened and virtually ended the budding recovery.

If the charge is hypocrisy, (a) it wouldn't show that Putin's actions are justified (hypocrisy is the compliment vice pays to virtue, which here would be not seizing part of other countries); and (b) geopolitical regions aren't individual people, so there's no inconsistency with Obama rejecting a principle (attack other countries) endorsed by other American leaders. Also, Kosovo was relevantly dissimilar to what's going on in Ukraine, because the Yugoslav military engaged in ethnic cleansing against ethnic Albanians. It's hard to see how they could live together in the same nation after that. We have seen no indications of anything similar in Crimea...(2) It's not clear that the Ukrainian protests and coup were undemocratic.

Putin will probably just let the Dombas rot, because the mayhem was an end in itself.","The Russians have vivid memories of what Stinger missiles did to them in Afghanistan.  Stingers and Javelin anti-tank missiles should be going into Ukraine now.  Just lie about doing so, since Putin lies about everything...Have Putin and Lavrov considered the costs of rebuilding the Dombas after they destroyed it?

His relations with the West have been ruined for a generation, huge and enduring economic losses have been imposed on Russians, and no responsible Western business leader would invest there for the foreseeable future.

It seems to me the outstanding example of this is in fact Putin.","Putin thinks he is reasserting Russia's greatness, but what he is really doing is emphasizing what a pathetic, atavistic, faded power it has become.  A nation with nothing to offer the world beyond its hydrocarbons.  In the United States we do not need military parades and jingoism to assert our greatness.","Mr. Putin has damaged Russia's standing in the world, probably for a generation, and done damage to its economy that will accumulate.  All so he can lord it over a bunch of peasants in what looks like a backwater wasteland?  It doesn't sound like a good exchange to me.","Republicans and those of their mentality place much more emphasis on the mindless doing and action than on the thinking and discussion that ought to come first.  George W. was an example of such thinking, and Putin has fallen into the same trap.","The Ukrainean government had inflicted heavy blows on the rebels in recent weeks, so Putin undoubtedly ordered the escalation invoving the shipment of the missiles.  I hope the lawsuits which are coming target him and his hidden fortune directly."
paul,,,,"TO me the most hilarious aspect of all this is how recently, in the face of Putin's naked aggression into eastern Ukraine, members of the GOP here took glee in holding up Putin as a 'real' leader as opposed to Barack Obama's seeming helplessness and appeasement..If there's one positive to be gleaned from this horror, it's that Putin has been revealed for all the world to see as the former KGP operator he actually is - a megalomaniac who callously steps over the bodies of hundreds of innocent bystanders, dead because of his actions, while accusing the government of the country he has been doing everything he can to destabilize of being responsible. .. It would be laughable if it wasn't so utterly pathetic.","I hope before NYT readers get excited about various strange comments they would realize that Russia is waging an energetic cyberwar on discussions lists like this one.

Given the level of corruption going on within Russia, pray tell, what the heck kind of 'pressure' can Obama or for that matter, Europe, which actually sits on Russia's doorstep going to successfully apply?  Any ideas?","Interesting analysis..here is my take...1-USA...Stay the heck out of the eastern Europe situation. From Russia's view, they gave up too much when the USSR broke up, ie, some territory where Russians are in the majority. It is a fight between Russia and their western neighbors. We should only intervene in any multi lateral effort re humanity relief or prevention of war crimes..2-We should fight ISIS. They are intl. war criminals and have killed Americans. Otherwise stay the heck out of taking sides, again, only re a humanity effort or to prevent war crimes. If Putin wants to prop up Assad, like him.

Marv Raps,,,,"Mr. Putin's fantasy may be as unfounded as the West's fantasy that Russia is planning to restore the USSR.  Nevertheless, the West's role in bringing about the crisis in the Ukraine, which began with the overthrow of an elected President by forces that were not all that peaceful or even entirely Ukrainian, is well documented.  The demands of the EU, the expansion eastward of NATO, the encouragement that US politicians and diplomats gave to the demonstrators in Kiev, all ignored the legitimate concerns of Russians and eastern Ukrainians.   ..It it is time to break the logjam of cold war thinking once and for all.  The Soviet Union was once our ally in the war against Fascism and suffered more than any ally in the struggle to defeat Hitler.  ..Russia under Putin has been helpful in our dealings with Syria and Iran.  Respecting the legitimate economic interests and geopolitical concerns of Russia is worthwhile and might just open the door to greater cooperation in the future.  ..Ukraine was politically divided before Yanukovych was ousted and will remain so until Kiev finds a way to achieve political unity.  And that achievement is only possible without Russian or Western interference.  ..Crimea's link to Russia is historic and ethnic and the will of its citizens need to be respected.  ..It is time to reset the attempt to reset relations between Russia and the Unites States.","You may wish to focus on what Mr. Douthart calls America's two dangerous illusions about Russia.  Russians may have harbored hopeful illusions of their own.  They may have thought a more internationally cooperative and less armed Russia would generate greater acceptance by the West.   ..After all Russia has played a cooperative role in international exploration of space, transporting American scientists to and from their Space Station.  Russia cooperated with the United States in a significant reduction in the stockpile of intercontinental nuclear missles.  Russia got President Obama off the horns of the Syrian poison gas dilema and possibly helped to avoid another American military quagmire in the Middle East.  Russia played a pivotal role in the hopeful negotiations with Iran over her nuclear development.  ..In return the West has methodically expanded NATO, a 1949 military alliance designed to contain the old Soviet Union, eastward into Russia's backyard and is being urged to move closer along her southern border.   The West has failed to recognize the complicated history between Russia and the countries on her border that comprised the USSR, using simple minded rhetoric like landgrab  and comparing Putin to Hitler.  The West has many illusions and some are dangerous to world peace.","Restart the cold war!  What an original idea.  Move those ICBM's back into place, get those Strategic Air Command bombers flying round the clock.  Bring back air raid drills with school kids hiding under wooden desks.  Start testing nuclear bombs in the desert again.  Bring back the good old days of international paranoia.  ..Complain about Putin all you want and lament the fate of Crimea.  However, do not forget Russia's cooperation in providing American scientists with taxi service to the International Space Station she helped to build.   Do not forget that Putin rescued Obama from the horns of dilema over Syria's poison gas and possibly helping to avoid another American quagmire in the Middle East.  Do not forget Russia's aide in bringing Iran to the negotiating table over her nuclear development and giving the world some hope of a peaceful outcome.  ..Before we write off further cooperation with Russia, let us also remember that NATO, a 1949 military alliance headed by the United States whose mission was to contiain the Soviet Union, has moved relentlessly eastward toward her borders.  Imagine our attitude if the reverse were true, and Russia entered into a military alliance with Mexico.   Senator McCain, among others, would explode.  ..International cooperation is better than confrontation.","Indeed, the morning after the morning after Putin may realize he was barking at the wrong tree.  I wonder if the protestors of Independence Square, euphoric the morning after getting rid of their elected President, might feel the same way the morning after the morning after.  ..Crimea will stay Russian and only time will tell what the rest of Ukraine will do with and for its citizens who were not part of the Maidan uprising, namely those who voted for Yanukovych.  ..The question everyone will eventually ask is could change have come peacefully and democratically by waiting for the next election and would Ukraine have remained intact if it had.","Rigidity has never been the hallmark of leadership, especially on the international stage.  The ability to see international conflicts and challenges from the perspective of regional players and regional history is essential and a welcome contrast to the self-appointed righteousness of Bush's either-you-are-with-us-you-are-against-us policy. ..The world is not divided between the forces of good and evil.  There ar many shades of gray.  Regional history and the pasions they generate are not to be denied and generally should not be a matter for American intervention.  We have seen over and over again the negative consequences of taking sides in regional coflicts with arms and army. ..Mr. Friedman's point about the expansion of NATO into Russia's backyard is well taken.  There is no geopolitical threat to the countries who formed the Alliance in 1949 and every need for Russia's cooperation in solving conflicts around the world.  It was, after all, President Putin who found a way to difuse the chemical weapons issue in Syria, without resorting to American military intervention and the unintended consequences that would have brought...President Obama's flexibility and restraint is to be admired.  The crises in Crimea is a direct result of the overthrow of a democratically elected President and must be resolved by Ukrainians, Crimeans and Russians without western interference.","Imagine if Occupy Wall Street seized control of the Mall in front of the Capitol.

After World War II, during which 25 million Soviet citizens were killed and their country destroyed by Hitlers Scorched Earth retreat, the Cold War resulted in the encircling their country by nuclear missiles.  ..Are we surprised that Putin would be weary of a Westernized Ukraine?  Is he deaf to Senators McCain and Graham call for the expansion of NATO to nations on Russias border?   ..It is time for some clear thinking about Russia.

Even the thought of recognizing their achievements or expressing gratitude for their contribution to the defeat of fascism in Europe is rare.   The expansion of NATO, a 1949 military alliance to contain the Soviet Union, after the fall of the Soviet Union is a perfect example.  ..While Russia's annexation of Crimea violates international norms, its motivation lies with the West's forcing Ukraine to decide between Russia and the EU and subsequent overthrow of an elected President in Kiev.  Had the EU been more accommodating in allowing Ukraine to retain economic interests with Russia or had the pro-western demonstrators in Kiev used the ballot box instead of the barricade, Crimea would still be part of Ukraine.  ..Blaming Putin for everything may be easier but misses the point.","This has to be the invasion that wasn't.  Not a shot fired, not a would inflicted not a brick damaged.  The people of Crimea have a bigger stake in the affair than the people of Arizona or South Carolina, though you wouldn't know it to listen to the hysterical Senators McCain and Graham.   The people of Crimea seemed to have welcomed the Russians and don't feel the sky is falling.  ..Who, by the way, is speaking for the majority of Ukrainians who voted for the ousted President Yanukovych?  Why couldn't the demonstrators have waited for the next election to oust him legally?   And what role did the American Ambassador Pyatt and Assistant Secretary of State Nuland play by supporting the demonstrators?  Does President Putin's charge of American interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine have some validity?","How long before the austerity that the EU demanded of Greece, Ireland and Spain and will require of Ukraine results in new demonstrations in Independence Square and the overthrow of the current government?  ..The enemy may not be Putin but the backward thinking of western financial wizards that brought us a second gilded age, with all misery it inflicts on the working class."
dan h,,,,"in all fairness - why would we expect Putin to help prop up a Ukrainian regime that is hostile to Russia?  Best to let the Eastern and Western Ukrainians negotiate a peace that is acceptable to both sides.  The differences between Eastern and Western Ukraine are greater than Red State vs. Blue State American.  If Western Ukraine wants to keep Eastern Ukraine within the family, they are going to have to be willing to allow a fair degree of autonomy - just like states in the USA have.  I can assure you that our friends in Texas would be protesting just as hard as the Eastern Ukrainians if they were not allowed to choose their own leaders - and instead were required to accept a governor appointed by Barack Obama..Obama and Kerry need to quit makes threats to Putin (he is a big boy and doesn't respond well to threats) and instead involve him in a realistic solution in Ukraine - not a we win you lose solution.",,,,,,,,,
Porter,,,,"This is the obvious and inevitable next step in Putin's program to absorb Ukraine into Russia, and shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone...After all, Ukraine is where Russia began.  Kiev was founded at the confluence of two major rivers by the Rus, Scandinavian traders and fighters who brought together the disparate peoples up and down the north-south rivers of the Russian interior and welded that gigantic trade route into a nation...Putin wants to restore that nation, in the short run by returning errant areas to the geographical borders of the former Soviet Union, whose break-up Putin and his fellow ex-KGB operatives consider to have been the worst things that ever happened to Russia...I have no doubt that most of what is currently Ukraine will become part of Russia, as will some or all of Moldova and potentially other areas as well...How does this affect us in real life.  Actually, very little if at all.  We have no strategic interests in that area despite all the bluster from politicians and talking heads. ..Obama is taking a slow and cautious course, but in the end Putin will win those areas and absorb them into Russia.  And Putin's favorable poll numbers will continue to climb, even past their current approval ratings of 80.","It's clear what will happen.  Putin will do whatever he needs to do to gain control of a major land bridge to his naval base in the Crimea...Without that land bridge through what's now eastern Ukraine, his warm-water port and naval base with ready access to the Mediterranean will be largely inaccessible except by air, or by long sea voyage from his ports in the north that are locked in by ice every winter.  ..Putin is devious, but he's predictable.  Are we, much less Europe, ready to go to war to deny him access to the Crimea?  Only fanatical Republican war hawks in Congress and their financial backers in our war industries are crazy enough to wish us into total war with Russia.","Well, it's just more nonsense, isn't it?  Putin's denying involvement in the civil war is absurd, what with Russia supplying the rebels not only with heavy armor, tanks and artillery but also guns and missiles and with Russian soldiers pouring into eastern Ukraine, supposedly on vacation.  Just absolute nonsense...A cease-fire would enable the rebels to regroup and consolidate their strength, build up further supplies of military hardware from uninvolved Russia, repair and create new fortifications, and solidify their self-rule...Let's not forget the Russian invasion and conquest of Crimea, which seems to have become lost in the throes of events in the east...For any ceasefire to work, Russian troops in Crimea need to return to base and return the Ukrainian bases they captured to Ukraine, Russia needs to withdraw its troops from eastern Ukraine and tell its troops that their vacations are over, and Russia needs to return control of eastern border crossings to Ukraine...That would be a good beginning.","As expected.  Now Putin has another big excuse for an armed 'intervention' to 'save' the Russians in eastern Ukraine - a humanitarian crisis!..Next step after that will be annexation of sufficient land in eastern Ukraine to give Russia a land bridge to Crimea, which is essentially an insupportable island with no direct land contact with Russia without Ukrainian permission...And so it goes.  Russia re-expands, the Russian people go crazy with patriotism, and Putin wins another round.","If I'm not mistaken, Khodorkovsky's gigantic wealth, like that of the other oligarchs, came about when he grabbed a gigantic portion of the wealth of the Soviet Union as it was disintegrating.  In Khodorkovsky's case, he grabbed Yukos oil and became Russia's 1 oil baron...He wasn't born to it, he didn't earn it, he just plain stole it from his country.  Then Putin stole it from Khodorkovsky and threw this oligarch into prison in Siberia.  Other oligarchs either stayed put and paid off Putin and his gang, or else headed over to London (what author Daniel Silva calls the Russian city otherwise known as London...While I do sympathize somewhat with Khodorkovsky - nobody should have to endure a Siberian labor camp - my sympathy doesn't extend to his losing his unearned fortune to the PutinKGB Mafia that runs Russia.","It's been obvious from the beginning, when Putin had his naval troops in Crimea take over that peninsula for Russia, that Russia would need a land bridge to connect the Crimea with the rest of Russia.  Otherwise, how would it be supplied and be an effective part of Russia?..The Crimea and its Russian bases are Russia's only real outlet to the Black Sea and are essential for Russia to have a military presence on that sea and in the Middle East.  With a series of fickle governments in Kiev, it made sense militarily, strategically and economically for Russia to directly control all of Crimea.  It's Russia's route to the Black Sea and from there, out to the world...The only question has been when and how Putin would achieve that land connection.  Apparently he's devised what appears to be a very workable plan to gain at least the land bridge to Crimea, and perhaps a larger chunk of Ukraine as well.  ..Remember that all of Ukraine was historically a part of the Russian and, later, Soviet empires.  Going back further, Kiev is where Russia - the land of the Rus - began.  ..Putin's intentions are clear and his approval ratings in Russia are out the roof.  He's not going to stop now, Ukraine can't possibly stop him even with their newly-instituted draft, and Europe isn't going to war.  My guess is that he's going to take a lot of land in eastern Ukraine and in the eventual negotiations to end the war will settle for the essential land bridge to Crimea - for now.","It's pretty obvious that the surface to air missile that brought down this civilian jetliner originated in Russia.  It is indeed doubtful that it was captured weaponry from a Ukrainian military base, and more likely that it was brought in as part of the military supplies and hardware supplied to the pro-Russian militants in Eastern Ukraine and their numerous Russian military advisors and participants...From the messages sent back and forth by the rebels, it appears that the idiots who shot down the jetliner had no idea that they were located on a major commercial air route from Europe to Asia.  They should never have been given the weapons in the first place, and at minimum supervised in their use...Now the bodies of the victims are being removed along with their belongings and belongings of unidentified sources.  Body parts litter a wide area, and there's little cause to believe that the perpetrators, their fellow fighters and their Russian advisors will do a respectable job not only of showing the area of impact of the missile on the body of the plane, because that would be proof positive of a missile strike, finding parts of the missile itself so its type can be identified, or of handling the scattered remains of the 295 victims of this atrocity, which will probably never be sent on to their families in their countries of origin...This is an atrocity of war, aided and abetted by Vladimir Putin and his gang of thugs.","President Obama has recently ratcheted up our sanctions about the Putin crowd.  That's what he's doing about it, in addition to having Secretary Kerry press harder for the EU to join in the expanded sanctions but there's little more that can be done short of putting boots on the ground and becoming engaged in what would become a major war.  And only Senator McCain and some other Republican crazies want that to happen...The EU is hobbled by its dependence on Russian natural gas; an alternative pipeline through Turkey and the Caucasus is years away.  ..Sometimes reality bites.",,
Katerina,,,,"Wouldn't it be lovely to know what percentage of the Russian people Mr. Navalny really represents? If Putin stopped jailing opposition candidates, denying them access to the media that he and his supporters enjoy, repressing opposition protests and so on, Mr. Navalny's support could be accurately quantified in a fair election...Of course, this isn't happening any time soon. Because Putin understands that if Mr. Navalny got nearly 13 of the vote in an unfair election, there's a good chance he would get a majority in a fair one.",,,,,,,,,
Szafran,,,,"To the people posting here about restoring the Russian dignity by Putin and international conspiracy to bring Russia to it's knees...I would advise you to talk to the people in Germany, about how it happened that 80 years ago a majority of people in Germany I think really honestly believed that their patriotic duty was to assert the assaulted pride of Germany as a nation, and to fight an international conspiracy against Germany...Germany people recovered, but the process had been tragic for both them and the rest of the world.","Why do the USA, EU, and NATO characterize Mr. Putin's support for self-determination by these actors aggression?..Because he is sending military units (GRU) into an independent country. This is called aggression...Russia (under Putin or anybody else) could have openly lobbied (diplomatic means) Ukraine to guarantee  to Russian minority (do not confuse this with Russian speakers) things like use of language or  favored conditions to  legislative representation (e.g.  in Poland ethnic minority parties do not have to clear an otherwise required 5 popular vote threshold to get representatives  into country's parliament)...There are tons of rules and laws in the European body of law intended to guarantee two things: that minorities are not discriminated against, and that there is no reasonable cause for governments to support separatism in another state. Otherwise everybody in Europe would be at everybody else's throat over the minority rights.","Nancy: Russia has been judicious and tempered?..A military annexation of Ukrainian land you call judicious and tempered?..Sorry, it was Ukrainian government that was tempered to the extreme. Just that one fact (Crimea) is a casus beli. You know, this thing with killing people by the thousand. It was the Ukraine government which did an extremely hard, but the right thing at that moment. ..Writing about poor unjustly vilified Putin in this context is a travesty.","So, we have the Remember the Alamo phrase being used to support the some people idea of joining Putin's Russia...I used to think that Alamo meant something else..But well, I am not American, if Americans tell me that William Travis would fight to the last in order to be given hero's funeral at Kremlin I guess I have to believe it.","Good essay. Not the least because it does mention US did in the recent past some questionable acts, at least in a hindsight. Perhaps this is still something US stands (positively) out - readiness to openly reexamine and reevaluate past policies. ..Putin is right at some points - that West wanted to push on Russia things like free speech or rule of law. But it appears he counts this as aggression, which people of the West find incomprehensible. Additionally, he sees free speech as a tool of psychological warfare against his country. So this may well be, unfortunately, the ideologically rooted conflict. ..I really wish Putin and people who support him in Russia red and understood the sentence in the assay conclusion: A democratic Russia will not always define its interests as we do, but will become a more stable partner with other democracies. This is not about subjugating Russia.","Greg: except it is Putin who supplied those SAMs to separatists. ..Yes, it was probably a mistake, if killing of 300 people (80 children) can be called that. But the responsibility goes up the chain, even without the fact that all the armed killing in Eastern Ukraine had been started and is fueled by Russia.","Mark: Novorossiya - the term introduced by Mr Putin during his we got Crimea and what you can do about it? speech denotes much more territory than Crimea and Donbas. ..Hysteria? I would think the other way - in this year one major European country grabbed pieces of another country, using military force, at the cost of many thousands civilian and military casualties. Violating numerous international agreements. And the agreement violations and lies continue. I see rather than anyone trying to think business as usual is a bit divorced from reality.","R36: there is a world of difference between deny self determination and suppressing armed movement supported and initiated from abroad. ..The question of what does Russia want is becoming much harder when on the same day that Mr. Putin officially denies Russia's involvement, Russian APCs drive into Ukraine and engage in fighting there. Because this would seem impossible, other seemingly impossible things no longer seem impossible...Many of us at some point discover the terrible price of lying - even if we say the truth, rational and logical, nobody believes us any longer. Not because of spite.","Yulia,..others had already pointed it out: civilian aircraft squawk their identity to everybody around. There is zero chance for a military integrated AA defense system to target MH17 while thinking it is Putin's plane...Also, it would be a huge stretch to think Ukrainians would deliberately hunt (with SAMs!) for the top of Russian command and control. They are not at war. First, Russian response would be devastating. Plus plenty other reasons.","vs: if it was a fighter which had shot down the plane, with guns, talking about markings might have a (very remote) sense. ..But civilian planes have radar transponders identifying them. The one from MH17 worked correctly until shot down. And it was shot down by a radar guided missile, not visual id. I someone was hunting for Putin (preposterous), hunting a specific plane, no way heshe would target (instantly identifiable) MH17...Also, those two planes (Putin's and MH17) were together over Warsaw, over half and hour apart. Routes to Moscow and to Kuala Lumpur are quite different from there...So this whole Putin's plane theory is just muddying waters."
Babeouf,,,,"Hilarious stuff. One of the aims of Us  policy around its support of the Ukrainian coup was the isolation of Russia from Europe. Of course ,without recourse to any act of genius, Putin will instead move Europe and the US further apart Well what did you expect. A Russian Tsar visited  Britain before the USA existed. Europe and the Russians go back centuries. And this isn't going to stop because European leaders got into the  bad habit of taking their foreign policy wholesale from Washington.

Viktor was not Putin's puppet, as Putin knows. Yanuk's political base was the Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. But Yanuk governed in the interests of a clan of oligarchs. Just before ,the democratically elected, Yanuk was overthrown in a coup, he blackmailed Putin 16 billion or else (Russian navy out of Crimea). Yanuk and friends would divide the spoils. And when it was gone they would demand more. What saved Putin from this public humiliation@? It  was the US State Departments pro coup policy. Putin's trump card is the stupidity and ignorance of US officials.",The Russian leader Putin has about 80 of the Russian population backing his Crimea gambit. The EU cannot get majority support from the public of Western Europe for any confrontation with Russia. Economic or otherwise. Hence the need for sanctions that the ordinary Western  citizen doesn't notice.  The bout of bankrupting Wsetrmn Imperialism from Iraq to Afghanistan to Libya is remebered  across Europe. Whose current leaders will be quite unable to whip up the froth on a cup of coffee over Putin's move . The Crimean people voted to reestablish the pattern of 1954 (or there abouts) so what. Putin took advantage of a Western Coup that hadn't been properly thought through. He was awake then which is more than can be said for the chancellor of Germany.,"He has lost interest in the West as the magnet of Russian development, portraying it rather as the flawed and predatory civilization ' Which of course it is.

The Bear has certainly turned and about time to.",Putin is no longer required to do anything. The use of fascist irregulars  to overthrow the democratically elected President of Ukraine did what Putin couldn't do  It mobilized the ethnic Russian population in the South and East of Ukraine. Pressure from the fascists in Kyiv on the political  representatives of Ukrainian oligarchs led to the military punishment expeditions into the East of Ukraine. And directly to the murderous burning of ethnic Russians in Odessa. After this events acquired their own momentum in the East. So now its further  fragmentation or a federation that those in the East will accept.  Putin is waiting to see if the US government intends to continue gnawing on the bones of its Ukrainian coup or negotiate. When the US makes its position clear in its  practice Putin will reply to the Donetsk appeal for incorporation into the Russian federation.,"If the West didn't want Crimea to vote to skeedadle they shouldn't have recognised an armed  Coup in Ukraine involving fascists.  And I'm stating again  what should be obvious to a turnip by now. If the West doesn't negotiate seriously with Russia over the political structures in the radically changed  Ukrainian political landscape the East of Ukraine will skeedadle next. Humans are a species of animal and like other animals they get spooked, from time to time. The people in the Russia speaking regions of Ukraine are spooked and are liasble to bolt for an exit. No blather from Western politicians will make the least difference here. What Putin says might. If he says it strongly. If he believs what he says. Its up to the Wewstern leaders now. On the basis of their performance so far I expect the East of Ukraine to split off.","The idea that an ex Oligarch was going to prove a substantial threat to Putin was always farcical. Perhaps the US is an exception ,as in so much else, but in the rest of the world many people would think 'Why lock up only one?'","Putin made it clear from the very start of the Ukraine crisis that he was open to negotiations. And Western leaders made it clear that there was nothing to negotiate over, the Ukrainian coup was a 'done deal'.   Now he makes the offer again. Given previous reactions by  US  political leaders  Putin will be basing his plans on a further  rejection. By  Western leaders  and whichever Oligarch is declared to be  the winner of the Ukraine election.  Putin will by now believe that US leaders are quite incapable of changing their 'Take it or leave it', view  of  'partnership'.  So Putin can afford to appear reasonable. He expects US intransigence and a worsening of the Ukraine crisis.","A lot of comments here show how utterly out of touch the US has become. Putin won't become 'a pariah' just because leaders representing about 17 of the worlds population say he is. Clearly he has China's support. Is India going to stop purchasing Russian weapons,oil or gas? Have you hidden knowledge known only to the Western cognoscenti.  The behavior of Western leaders is going to look, outside the Western media, more and more ludicrous to the rest of the world as this century advances. 2016 (using  PPP) China becomes world's largest economy. By 2036 twice as large as its nearest rival. Hey wasn't that US government policy at one stage to promote China in its struggle against the USSR .  Very successful. But its a bit late to resurrect this ploy against Russia after announcing  the pivot to Asia. But that is how Empires end the tasks become to great for the center's resources.",Yulia lost the election because she lost the economy. It was 'the economy stupid'. If Russia offers loans and industrial projects they will now get an appropriate welcome. It was a 'Bread and Peace' election and the last agent of Orange could offer neither. And just for those who don't travel outside the USA.  Using European political  categories  Putin is a right wing authoritarian. As is the government he heads.

Dan Kuhn,,,,"Invade Russia? Who? The USA? Europe? NATO? That would mean total war, nuclear war. So when the 20,000 or so thermal nuclear warheads start exploding all over the norther hemisphere where are you going to hide and what are you going to eat, if you should survive the initial exchange, after three or four years of nuclear winter?..President Putin has a doctrine. You know those things that American Presidents are fond of creating, such as the Monroe doctrine? That doctrine is; That since Russian disbanded most of its conventional armed forces after the Cold War ended, that if Russia were attacked, that it would respond with nuclear weapons. You do know what that means dont you? That means the end of the world. The Northern Hemisphere immediatly and the rest of the world with in a year or so..If the US had not put 5 billion dollars into the overthrow of the freely elected president of the Ukraine we would not now be in this mess. NATO is not only dancing around what to call what they claim Russia is doing in the Ukraine, they have made it perfectly clear to the Ukraine that NATO will not be taking military action against Russia to defend the Ukraine.( Hence the peace talks.) You do know why they have made this perfectly clear dont you? Well it is because the NATO countries are not suicidal. NATO does not  bomb or invade nuclear armed states such as North Korea and or China or Russia, it bombs and or invades third world countries that have no real military to defend themselves.",Do you know something that the rest of the world does not know. It is NATO that is expressing fear of Russia no the other way around. Putin is not afraid of anything at all. he knows that NATO countries do not have a death wish and so will never attack Russia.,"Mr. Putin as thug. Is Mr. Putin a thug? Really? If you compare the invasion and total destruction of Iraq to the bloodless take over of Crimea Mr. Putin looks like genius. Iraq cost the USA 3 trillion dollars,close to 5,000 dead soldiers, never mind the walking dead, possibly a million Iraqui lives lost and of course the loss of the aura of invincibility of the US armed forces.  So, did you call Bush, Cheney, Perle and Wolfowitz, thugs for the invasion of this weakened country that was no threat to the US, on a bunch of deliberate lies?..Mr. Putin is responding to the EU and US push to take over the Ukraine and install NATO and an anti ballistic missile system right on Russias border. Clearly an existential  threat to security of his country. After the Second World War and even up to the present day NATO and in particular has sought to make Russia an enemy. Why?  Because the US always needs an  enemy to feed the national war machine and keep the money flowing to the MIC...Just exactly what has the West to offer Russia or for that matter the Ukraine? Democracy you say? What has that done for the West? Central banks own the West  outright with the citizens of the West paying billions of dollars a day in interest to the money lenders and their standard of living falling year after year. An infinitismal percentage of the population of the West living in opulance and the rest working three jobs just so that they can eat. Democracy the best system? Really? Not from where I sit.",,,,,,,
r.j. paquin,,,,"It's about time someone told the Russians to take a long walk off a short pier, to take a hike, learn to count past three, and get plenty of rest with their nappy blankets..Maybe then they will become part of an adult world and start taking care of their own within their own borders...Gads, there are Russians living in NYC and Cleveland.  Wonder if Putin feels responsibility for them?  Well, come on big boy, pick on the big dog in this hemisphere.","Do understand, for Putin communism is a religion with moderates and radicals. Not unlike all religions.  He is a communist..Similar to the radicals who did a number on the USA in September 2001, he is a terrorist.  Of  late, though, he hasn't demonstrated the traits of a terrorist; he does what says he will do without all the sneaking around. His intentions are evident for all to see...As for our POTUS, when, not if, sanctions become the m.o. he needs to forget about baby steps.  He needs to come down like a giant squashing a bug..Oh, we wring our hands, speak sweet words, but a religious fanatic like Putin takes that all into consideration and does what his faith tells him to do..Well, we in the west should look to our god, greed, and make Russia very poor so it never returns to play the games they play now.  This generation of Russians has toilet paper, but it was their parents who stood in line to buy it; you would think the parents would pass on that history.  But, oh no, they have a spark of the old time religion.",,,,,,,,
K.S.Venkatachalam,,,,"The German Chancellor and the French President have offered an escape route to the Russian President by brokering a cease fire with Ukraine. Putin,  who was facing one of the worst economic crisis with falling oil prices, tumbling Rubble, and virtual ostracisation by the West, was losing ground in terms of his popularity in Russia. The peace move would not have come at a better time...It must be remembered that any military assistance to Ukraine would have made Putin a hero in his country, and would have led to a cold war. It is in this context, the brokered negotiation by Angela Merkel should be understood and appreciated. Russia should not attempt to break the peace deal, as it is not in its interests to see its neighbor being fully armed by the West. This would lead Russia to be perpetually engaged in its limited war  with its neighbor and, in the process, see  its economy on a free fall. A situation not in the best interests of the ordinary Russian.","I'm always amazed by the double standards adopted by the US and its allies when it comes to taking a firm stand against countries forcibly annexing small countries. The anschluss of Tibet by China met only with token protest by US and other countries. By not taking a firm stand, the US can't now suddenly wake up and criticize Russia for annexing Crimea. Timely action against China would have deterred Russian is forceful annexation of Crimea. ..US should understand that Russia is no Iraq or Syria. It is a superpower and can't be bullied into submission by  economic sanctions. US, after the breakup of USSR, had always underestimated Russia and forgot that Vladimir Putin is Mikhail Gorbachev. He is a shrewd politician and an astute strategist. He has had a firm grip in Russian politics for over two decades...President Obama should initiate steps to engage with Russia to find peaceful solutions. he must also remember that sanctions work only when countries are contemplating waging a military intervention in other countries. In this case, Crimea has already been annexed, and sanctions would not act as a deterrent against Russia. Only meaningful dialogue would put an end to the conflict in Ukraine.","I'm a greater admirer of Friedman's columns in NY times. However, his column    It's all about May 25 has come as a big disappointment. It lacks both the intellectual rigor and an understanding of the situation prevailing in Ukraine. The maidan analogy does not apply to Ukraine. The revolt ls  against the Russian opposition to Ukraine joining  EU, whereas the protests in Egypt was against their own government.  ..The attempt by NATO and US forces to keep their air force and armed forces ready  in case of Russian invading Ukraine is very confrontational, especially when Putin has agreed for talks to end the conflict. Secondly, there is no guarantee that EU will admit Ukraine in their fold. Moreover, a small misstep by NATO or US can lead to full blown war in the area. President Obama should engage in a dialogue with Putin to end the conflict as military intervention is fraught with danger. One must remember Russia is a super power, and will not kowtow to such confrontational tactics.Let better sense prevail among all the leaders to find a solution to end the conflict.","Putin earned the unconditional support of the Russians during the first two terms as the President as, for the first time ever, the middle class started to prosper in his regime. The real income of Russians tripled and Russia witnessed a high economic growth. Being a shrewd politician that he is, he circumvented the law of being a President for two straight terms, and chose to become the PM for two terms. He has again become the President. However, over the last 2-3 years, he is slowly losing his aura as a reformer, as he is not able to  meet the expectations of the Russians, who are looking for better economic prosperity. What does he do to retain his control of Russian Politics? He annexes the predominately Russian speaking Crimea from Ukraine.  The US seems to be clueless while dealing with him, for he is no Saddam Hussein. Moreover, the US is slowly losing its influence in international politics. The best way is to engage with Vladimir Putin and persuade him to withdraw his forces from Crimea. Ukraine, on the other hand, should abandon its confrontational approach with Russia, by aligning with the West, which is perceived as a direct threat to Russian interests,and should instead enter into a dialogue with Russia to find a mutually acceptable solution. US,on the hand,should abandon its obscurantist policies like economic sanctions, as it will have no effect on the Russians. The only way to find a solution to the crisis is by engaging  with the Russians.","It is rue that Putin's luck is running out, after the free fall of Russian rouble due to falling oil and  gas prices, and the sanctions imposed by the West.  Putin committed two blunders; one, by annexing Crimea, thus inviting the wrath of Europe and the United States and, secondly, by not investigating shooting down of a passenger plane belonging to Malaysian airlines by the Russian rebels, which resulted in the tragic loss of over 200 innocent passengers. There is an old saying You reap what you sow and Putin is paying a price for his arrogance...However, in spite of Putin's failure, the West must not gloat over Russia's failing economy. We have seen in the past that the economic collapse of any country can have a domino effect on other countries. One must also realize that the poor Russians should not be faulted for one person's arrogance and misadventure. Russia, if it wants the sanction to be lifted, should immediately give back Crimea to Ukraine, which it had wrongly annexed. If Putin does not see the writing on the wall, it is only a matter of time when he will be consigned to the dustbin of history.","I have read a single well researched analysis in NYT on how to De-escalate the continuing crisis in Ukraine. on the other hand, we are continuing to read of imposing more and more sanctions against Russia to force it to mend its ways. I doubt whether such sanctions will yield the desired results.    ..One must try to understand why Russia is behaving the way it is doing. Russia is yet to get over the dismemberment of the erstwhile USSR. Putin wants to impress his fellow Russians that he will not allow the US to browbeat his country this time and, by doing this, he trying to become a hero in his country..You state in your OP ED that Ukranians, as individuals and collectively, are challenging Putin's values. By antagonizing their powerful neighbor they would be doing this at their own peril.","Thomas Friedman's article Putin and the Laws of Gravity is biased, as it fails to address Russia's concerns. There is no doubt that Ukraine will prosper by becoming a member of the European Union than under Russia. There is also no denying that the action against Crimea was deplorable, even assuming the ethnic Russians would have preferred to be part of  the EU than Russia.  However, it should be kept in mind that by letting off Ukraine from the Russian influence, the country would be a perfect  candidate for a  civil war, and the Ukrainian government would not be able to prevent ethnic conflicts between ethnic Russians and the radical elements, who want Ukraine to move away from the sphere of Russian influence. Putin, being an astute politician, realized the consequences of not interceding in Crimea. He certainly does not want Ukraine to go the Iraq way. I think only through dialogue, peace can be restored in Ukraine. The growing fear that Russia would send troops to Ukraine is way off the mark, as it would be dangerous for Russia to take such a foolhardy step. Putin is too shrewd to understand this.  ..Obama has completely misjudged the conflict and, if he thinks by imposing sanctions, Russia would kowtow to the such pressures, he has failed to appreciate that, unlike Iraq and Syria, Russia is a superpower.","Sir, your editorial is one sided and does not present the concern of Russia about the plight of Russian speaking Ukrainians in eastern Ukraine. I think your editorial and the US approach will lead to hardening of Russian stand. I think, unwittingly, we are provoking a potential conflict in Ukraine instead of finding possible solutions to bring Russia to the negotiating table. I understand that Russia has agreed for talks with Us and EU. ..One aspect which is worth noting is the complete silence of China on the Ukrainian conflict. China, as we all know, is a strong supporter of Russia. ..I feel a more sombre approach is needed to end this crisis. US should directly engage with Putin to find ways to end the  crisis instead of attacking which will not yield solution. One must keep in mind that Russia is no Iraq or Syria and can't be handled with kid gloves.","I don't  think US has any worthwhile strategy to deal with Russia. Putin, a shrewd that he is, will not risk his reputation or for that matter Russia's by trying to annex Ukraine, as by doing so, he would be putting enormous risk to his own reputation and also that of Russia's image. The only way of assuaging Putin's massive ego is to enter into a meaningful dialogue with him, and persuade him to withdraw his forces from Crimea till such time US and its allies are able to broker a  settlement acceptable to both Ukraine and Russia. ..US should forthwith stop its tirade against Russia and enlist the support of leaders from China, India, UK, France, Germany to jointly talk to the Russian leaders in exploring a settlement  acceptable to both Ukraine and Russia. If US continues its anti Russian rhetoric, Russia will attempt to exploit the t the  regional differences subsisting in Ukraine to its advantage.",
blasmaic,,,,"The take-down of the Beijing-Moscow alliance was not fitting of a New York Times editorial.  It basically says Putin is too proud to align with the largest country, largest Communist country, and nearly the largest economy on earth.  Explain in detail how that is just too humbling for Moscow after all its been through in the first two decades of post-Soviet government.  ..Affirming the American belief that consent of the governed is key to legitimacy is a better stance on Greater Crimea than inflaming nostalgia for Communist alliances with sanctions.  Even more simply put, the West has never been less important to Russia now that China is rising.","Areas of Ukraine that are contingent to and predominant Russian in language, ethnicity, and choice, should naturally be a part of Russia.  Putin has not gone far enough.  The new lines of demarcation should be stable lines that will last for decades or centuries.  The piece-by-piece annexation of lands that are Russian in all respects except name is a course of action that will maximize bloodshed and prolong strained relations.  Peace, stability, and normalcy require that the new borders be authentic to the will of the people who populate the land.",,,,,,,,
Elizabeth Renant,,,,"The EU is a tyrannical centralized bureaucracy reshaping European cultures and populations to suit its own agenda, which includes fronting for global corporatists only interested in gobbling up the world. If Putin weakens the EU, some of us will be delighted...That said, I do seem to recall that when Russia marched into Georgia, the West including George W. Bush screeched the word unacceptable! many times - but did nothing. So this isn't all that recent and the Ukraine is probably doomed. Come to think of it, Bush waggled his we're running out of patience! finger at Khartoum, too, over Darfur in the Sudan. But did - nothing. How many died there? One million give or take a few?..Wait till the floods of Ukrainian asylum seekers join the boat migrants and bang on the doors of Europe - Poland is already turning them back remorselessly - Poland loves helping the UK achieve multiculturalism by off-loading its excess unemployed there and welcoming back all that benefit money, but doesn't see why it should disturb its own cultural homogeneity or risk its economy with a flood of desperate cheap labour...Let's see if the West and Brussels ring their hands over these non-ocean going, Christian, pale-skinned asylum seekers the way they have been doing over the boat migrants from Africa...Mr. Cohen is shocked at the hypocrisy of the neoliberals in the West? Dear me. I'm not.","Any foreign office and service analyst off the record will tell you that 1) everyone knows perfectly that this is an invasion, and that the west isn't calling it one so that, should he be so moved, Putin can backtrack more gracefully, and 2) any ceasefire or peace agreement is mostly a sham. I saw our former ambassador to NATO on BBC news and he made no bones about it: eventually, Putin will have what he wants: the annexation of eastern Ukraine and possibly the rest of it, just as he did Georgia while Bush was in office, and the EU will do nothing and the rest of the west will do nothing...Russia's economy is in complete meltdown - any peace agreement (which will probably demand that eastern Ukraine become an autonomous state) will be agreed to only to lift the sanctions and give Russia's economy time to recover before it goes back and solidifies its gains in the Ukraine...As for Merkel - you would be surprised at how many people in Europe are beginning to talk about the specter of a Russo-German alliance.","Actually, the Deep State has no nationality - calling it American is disingenuous. And the Deep State deals mostly in money, not in incidents like these. Russia doesn't exactly have the cleanest escutcheon in the world, either. Trying to deflect attention from Putin's insanity (ummm, he did march into Georgia a few years ago, remember? and there is the little matter of Chechnya) by pointing to some massive conspiracy in the West rather smacks of a pot-kettle situation.",,,,,,,

I'm not thinking that my country is paradise and my President is angel. But I'm against this information war.

Philip,,,,"I do believe we should send arms to Ukraine, but of course not NATO troops, as Ukraine is not a NATO member.  If NATO limts itself to only providing non-lethal aid, while Russia is not only sending lethal aid but also the troops to use the weapons it sends, we are encouraging Putin to continue following Hitler's pre-WWII playbook on invasion.  We all know how that turned out.  ..The only way to stop Putin's continued land grab, is to match his conduct along with crippling sanctions.  This does NOT mean that the US is going to war with Russia over the Ukraine, and it does NOT mean that we are going to fund the lion's share of any aid provided.  The majority of aid expense should be shouldered by the EU, as the EU is the party directly threatened by Putin's conduct.","Neville Chamberlain (one time I called him William and got skewered by 10 people) reincarnated into Hollande and Merkel meet with Hitler (reincarnated in Putin) to reach a deal that isn't even clear; and truthfully has no chance of achieving anything...I don't want the Ukraine to join Nato now, because I don't want the US to have the responsibility of putting troops on the ground in the Ukraine.  However, who is Putin to tell the Ukrainian government whether is can or cannot join NATO. If the Ukraine ever does join NATO in the future, we should kick Turkey out of the group, as it is a primary supporter of ISIS, and let Ukraine take its place...The overwhelming issue right now is the security of the Baltic States, and NATO shoud amass troops on their borders with state of the art weaponry to make sure our NATO commitments to these members are kept. And, if this agreement on Ukraine falls apart, new and wide sweeping sanctions should be imposed on Russia and the US should send lethal weapons to Ukraine...Putin will break any agreement he ever makes, and is a compulsive liar.","Bravo to the Times Editorial Board for saying the unpleasant truth about Vladimir Putin...What the Times didn't say bluntly, but certainly made clear through its description of Putin, is that he is the world's next Hitler. All that crony capitalism. and the finding of a scapegoat in the LGBT community for the Russian community to take out its frustrations on, is so similar to Hitler that the comparisons cannot be denied. Then, when you look at his land grab of the Crimea and his undeniable support for the insurgency in Eastern Ukraine, it becomes quite clear that the world is dealing with its next fascist monster...For many, including myself, the Ukraine had become old news.   But the downing of this passenger jet brings Putin's behavior back front and center; and this time, I believe the whole world with the exception of China and North Korea will treat him and his form of government like the world pariahs they should be.","Sanction heavily, and send massive amounts of weapons to Western Ukraine, as well as military advisors to train the Ukrainians on how to use them.  Already, NATO is moving troops to Eastern member states...This round of sanctions needs to be truly crippling, and Europe needs to be fully on board.  I realize many European countries' economies are already reeling without factoring in limits on their trade with Russia, or Russian natural gas to heat their homes this winter.  However, if they don't take a strong stand now, such as freezing all Russian nationals' assets (which would go into the billions), and then using the liquid assets to buy oil from the Saudis for the winter, Russia will never stop pushing the envelope...Russia's leaders, who are used to an international lifestyle of culture, privilege, and luxury need to also know the party is over.  Once Russia is broke with its economy in freefall, and Russia's 1 is getting their money stolen, at the same time that they are barred from travelling to their Western European, New York, and Miami palaces which have been confiscated, the world will see a new and truly peace loving Russia very soon; and Putin's current friends in high places will turn on him.","So far, all sanctions have accomplished is stronger ties between Russia and China. However, if we undercut Russia's influence by getting closer with the Chinese, that, plus the increased sanctions, are going to hit Russia hard.  Putin's attitude towards the world is so fascist, that it could not be ignored, and sanctions are the least violent way to respond, and to let Russia's business community know that Putin's aggresive land grabbing will not in the long run further its interests.  Cultural isolation will add extra power to the punch.","To me, there is no mystery: Russia supplied the missile that downed the passenger jet; and trained the insurgents on now to use it.  There are photos of similar missiles being shipped back to Russia in the middle of the night after the tragedy, recordings between the separatists and Russia about the downing of the jet, and the obvious withholding of evidence to tamper with it. Believing Putin on anything is akin to purposeful stupidity...Now is the time for the leaders of the European Union to show whether they are all words and very little action, or whether they have more guts than William Chamberlain before WWII by heavily sanctioning Russia for assisting in the mass murder of their citizens.  If there is a united economic front to heavily sanction Russia, even though it risks financial damage to the EU, this mess will quickly end.  If the EU continues to be wishy washy, its leaders  might as well throw a press conference and tell its constituents: We do not have the guts to stand up to Russia, even if Russia aids in killing you, so you are on your own...Moreover, as we incur great expense defending Europe, our leaders tell us there is not enough money for OUR safety net; and Europe rightly criticizes us for not taking care of our citizens as well as EU countries take care of their consituents.  Fine, its time for the EU to pay its rightful share for its own defense.  Then the US can maintain a wonderful safery net for our own citizens.",,,,
Marina Dillon,,,,"Adam, don't be naive, IT IS just another achievement of his, have no doubt about it. There is a solid proof of that and if the world stops denying the fact: Putin's military has invaded and are controlling another part of Ukraine while the heroic Ukrainian army is trying to resist them and not let them further west. They have just shot this airplane with Buk, the missile system everyone in Ukraine knew they had there. They just thought they are taking down another Ukrainian  aircraft , that's it","Yes, but Putin's armed forces have been shooting every airplane that could in the territories of Ukraine they now control. They have shot a number of helicopters and airplanes in the past months along. This one happened to be international, otherwise nobody would cared if it were a Ukrainian aircraft with like 50 Ukrainians, like they did a couple weeks ago","I'm amazed by the naivety of commenters here. It's Russian military forces that has entered the territory of Ukraine and fight with the Ukrainian army trying to decent it. They have been shooting down airplanes on a regular basis since they've occupied, this time they thought it was another Ukrainian aircraft. Putin has armed morons with the most sophisticated missile systems  who have just killed 300 civilians, this time non-Ukrainian civilians. So this time, the world cares a little bit. Thank you Frau Mekel for supporting Putin and forcing the Ukrainian President to negate with the terrorists!.","This is just another Kremlin bot, making some cash on the side. Don't work so hard, despite Russian millions spent on Kremlin propaganda in the western media, most understand that all your ultra-right and fascism are the invention of Putin's political technologists. The revolution in Ukraine has been done by the best and biggest part of the Ukrainian civil society that have nothing to do with fascism. Do I near to mention that the newly formed interim government of Ukraine includes ethnic Jewish, Russians, Armenians and even a Roma?",,,,,,
Patrice Ayme,,,,"Putin is a dictator passed the tipping point into ever more violence. Should he conquer all of Ukraine (which he himself defined as his real problem), he would militarize Russia even more than it already is, and make the economic situation even worse. So only more aggression would then stabilize his regime...This pattern has been seen throughout history: militarization and invasion stabilize the augmentation of dictatorship...Once Putin has conquered Ukraine, he will push for more: he has already partly occupied Moldavia, WEST of Ukraine. Putin is already messing up with Hungary: there were street demonstrations about this, just yesterday, in Hungary. Putin uses the fact that Hungary is extremely dependent upon Russia's fossil fuels. ..Thus, piece by piece, Putin is exactly following Hitler's playbook, complete with a collapsing, over-militarizing economy. Putin is just more careful, because he knows Hitler went too fast. We have to give him an unambiguous warning that he will be stopped. The earlier, the less costly.","The methods used by Putin are exactly those of Hitler in 1938. In excruciating details. True, after killing 50,000 people in Chechnya, Putin was slow and careful, but not he has crossed a psychological tipping point, into the Dark Side. For the details:.<a hrefhttp:patriceayme.wordpress.com201403161938 titlehttp:patriceayme.wordpress.com201403161938 targetblank>http:patriceayme.wordpress.com201403161938<a>","Dont Feed the Bear.Pacifists say: do not provoke Putin, he has nukes and will attack if lethal defensive weapons are sent to Ukraine..This is a rather curious argument..Indeed, it makes the opposite case: that the greatest severity ought be applied on Putin, right away...Because what are pacifists saying? Putin is the most dangerous Leader, ever. So let's be nice to him..It is now known that, had the USA and Britain be as firm as France against Hitler in the 1930s, Hitler's own generals would have made a coup against him..But, instead, Britain and the USA made concession after concession to Hitler. So Hitler flew from success to success, undermining the position of the top German generals and marshals who thought that the dictator was completely crazy, and a danger to Germany.   ..Something similar is developing with Putin. As he occupies and annexes pieces of territory in Georgia, Moldavia, and now Ukraine, and the West is incapable to stop Putins avowed goal of bringing back what he calls the New Russia (half of Ukraine) and the Big Country (the USSR), Putin flies from success to success. ..So where does Putin stop? We have to know, if we do not want to be evil..But of course, pacifists dont know..Should we then keep our fingers cross, and hope for the best?.Why?.Behaving now as nothing will stop Putin, but for force, is not safe, but it is the safest strategy. If he is not completely crazy, it will stop him..Not trying to stop him, will certainly make him crazy","Roger is right...Not too smart appeasers say: don't resist Putin, he is a madman! He could start World War III! Kneel, and give him what he wants: Georgia, Moldavia, Ukraine, even Hungary.....So we give, and then what? Putin's economy will still be sinking under the weight of militarization. Putin is on the attack, because then he looks like the great defender, and he gets Hitler-like approval ratings of 85...What Putin needs, what will satisfy Putin, is not territory, it's war. So he will go on so that Russia feels at war. Give him Ukraine, he will invade WEST of Ukraine (as he is already doing in Moldavia)...The only thing that could, and will, stop him? External force. Psychologically, and politically, Putin needs war. Just not too costly a war. ..Spurning a Republic under fascist attack was tried in 1936-1939, when Spain was attacked by the dictators Hitler and Mussolini. Do we need a repeat?..Then France declared she would sell weapons to the Republic. Britian and the USA thought that would be a very bad idea, for the exact same reason evoked today to protect Putin. ..Result? Spain fell, millions died there. Worse: the Nazis learned to use modern weapons, and caught the Brits and French by surprise in 1940... From the training they had done in Spain. ..Ukraine gave up its nukes under defense guarantees.

What does peace fear? War. The president of France said there was war in Ukraine. The pacifists say no French, German or American, should die for Ukraine: Putin wants it, let him have it. Peace will follow...But then the question is: why does Putin want Ukraine? Does Putin wants all this property for the same reason as Hitler wanted the property of the Jews in 1938?..What else? Hitler attacked the Jews because his massive militarization program had impoverished Germany. He needed wealth and to look victorious. Same with Putin: he is remaking his entire military, all the way to nuclear forces, as if he knew world war was coming. ..Then pacifists said: let Hitler have the Jews, that's what he wants. No French, British, let alone American, should die for Jews..However, there was a matter of principle: can we let the leader of a great nation use massive lethal force to steal massive property? Can we tolerate crimes against humanity?..Putin is the first to annex territory in Eurasia, since Hitler..Some warn: dont make him mad, he is Hitler, with nukes..Question: why was Putin not acting like Hitler before? Because, before, he was afraid. Now he is not. Thus, to make him stop, one has to scare him..Some will say its too scary to try to scare him..Why?.Because he is Hitler, whine the pacifists..Then the question is this: did appeasers not learn history?

Like the Kaiser, a century ago, he hopes to win quickly, because the democracies are weak, in weapons and resolve. What could go wrong?","Less Democratic Than 1938:.Putin is a predator that has tasted blood. He loved it, and found the feeble and pathetic opposition exciting. His grotesque ideas, such as Kosovo (an independent country) is equal to Crimea (a territory Putin stole), have been respectfully received. ..Putins larbin Lavrov, another survivor from the Soviet dictatorship, is negotiating with John Kerry, the USA foreign minister, in Paris about the fate of Ukraine. ..Apparently, Putins crony historians identify the present Vladimir with Vladimir I of Kiev, who conquered Crimea, and converted there to Christianism in 998 CE (not 1998, 998 CE, 1016 years ago)...At least, in Munich in 1938, the Czechoslovaks were represented in personNow, no need for this. In Munich in 1938, Hitler wanted just a piece of Czechoslovakia, and he asked for permission. Later, having obtained what he wanted, he grabbed the rest of the country, cutting it in three...Putin asked for no permission to grab a piece of Ukraine (a country more than twice older than Russia). Putin does not even try to hide that Ukraine is his place, and he will do with it what he wants..What to do? Gain time, arm Ukraine, prepare for war. Only thus war will be avoided, if it can be. ..Otherwise what happened in 1936, and afterwards, will be repeated.","Ukraine was always turned to the West. This is what the conversion of Vladimir ! to Christianism in 998 CE, after he conquered Crimea, meant..Ukrainian princesses married early French kings..Moscow is a different story. A fort on the woods, it was founded by the youngest son of Alexander Nevski (who had beaten the Teutonic Knights). Moscow rose to prominence by collecting tax for the Mongols who had invaded and occupied Russia. ..Russia defeated the Mongols by using the same methods, only more ferociously. The Church was used as a secret society. The first Czar was Ivan the Terrible. His successors stayed terrible for 500 years. Stalin and Putin embodied that terrible mood. So this is indeed an existential crisis. Putin represents a mood of ravenous territorial conquest that characterized Moscow since its foundation, allowing the worst of the Dark Side to come in play. That mood is supposed to crush all in the way, including the exuberance of ideas. Including all complicated civilizations, all around, that are not under Moscows boot...That mood of invasion is best served by abjectly prostrating to, and obeying absolutely every word of, a supreme fascist leader, a Czar. ..Czars have only been checked by a violence stronger than the one that they had instigated. Sometimes, war is not the worst outcome possible. The worst outcome is to try to live under the boot of the beast..<a hrefhttp:patriceayme.wordpress.com20140421kremlin-protests-kievs-protests titlehttp:patriceayme.wordpress.com20140421kremlin-protests-kievs-protests targetblank>http:patriceayme.wordpress.com20140421kremlin-protests-kievs-prote...<a>"

That may be so. But it still does not mean the threat was there.","People of Crimea have a right to self-determination. But self-determination is not achieved by a referendum hastily called for two weeks from now, with no debate of the issue allowed, and with armed and masked men stationed in most cities. We do not know that most Crimeans wanted to rejoin Russia. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. Putin never bothered to find out. Had they called a referendum for, say, six months from now, removed all the armed people, allowed for free debate without intimidating journalists and cutting off TV channels, and allowed an option of stay in Ukraine as is in the referendum questions -- then we can talk about people of Crimea making a choice in their self-determination.","When we bombed Serbia and pried Kosovo lose (in the teeth of Russian opposition) US policy was all about self-determination and breaking up sovereign states if the will of the people favored it. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT PUTIN DID IN THE CRIMEA.No, this is not what Putin did in Crimea. He did not stop at prying Crimea loose from Ukraine, as you claim NATO did with Kosovo and Serbia. Putin went on to annex Crimea to Russia..The other differences was already pointed out by others -- the reasons Putin gave for invading Crimea (protecting ethnic Russians from some unspecified threats) were bogus. Ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was a fact.",Ukraine's main economic problem is the oligarchs. Unlike in Russia they are still in charge..Are you saying oligarchs are not in change in Russia?

He can cut gas to Europe. .Putin can do all those things even if no sanctions are imposed on him and his cronies. That is the point -- it is difficult to discern what Putin wants. If he really wants to restore some version of USSRRussian empire (there is no way to know for sure if this is what he wants, bu one has to wonder), then nationalization of Western companies is coming no matter what the West does.","A politician is eagerly giving an advise to his own country's adversary how to make his leaders (democratically elected, legitimate, highly popular now) vulnerable..Are you saying that Putin was democratically elected? I suggest you look up the definition of that. Getting a majority of votes after exerting pressure on the media and tightly controlling what it says, and after jailing of exiling all serious political opponents does not count as being democratically elected..being highly popular (which I am sure Putin is -- but how much of that is due to the coordinated efforts of state-controlled media?) is not the same thing as legitimate or democratically elected.","Dmitry,.your point seems to be that Putin's regime is not nearly as bad as USSR in 1960s.

nvr,,,,"Russia's covert strategy successes can be partially attributed to lessons learned by President Putin while he was stationed in Europe with the KGB..His teacher? Why the best teacher at destabilizing countries and governments which they do not like;The United States...We destabilized Poland, Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, not to mention, Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Philippines, Columbia, and the list goes on and Putin witnessed it first hand...Later, in a few short years, Russia witnessed itself surrounded by ex-Soviet Union countries now newly minted NATO members and they were not about to see that happen to their largest next door neighbor Ukraine..If the US, and the EU acted responsible they would have kept Russia's security and national interests in mind when they sought out Ukraine to join the EU and likely NATO membership...What the US and EU should do is direct Ukraine to hold free elections, to give more autonomy to Eastern Ukraine in governing their regionsstates, safeguard the rights of ethnic Russians including their language and guaranty that Ukraine will never be a NATO member nor store advanced or nuclear weapons inside their boarders...We threaten the Soviet Union with nuclear war in 1962, when they wanted to place missiles into Cuba and we cannot expect Russia to feel any different as they observe the US, EU, NATO, and Kiev's actions.","CAF....I agree with you on your point and we in America have a very long history of grabbing land, territories, installing dictators to ensure our direct or indirect control of natural resources and assets and going to war over control of geographical areas deemed to be in our national interest..The two most recent grabs were Iraq, our wanting a large military complex next door to Iran and control in Iraq's oil industry, but it did not work out due to armed civil resistance by the Iraqis and world opinion on our naked aggression, and Afghanistan, where rare earth minerals and to thwart Chinese gains in developing mining with the Afghans are our regarded as paramount to our government's national interest...Right or wrong, Putin is doing just what Bush Jr., Cheney and now Obama do. ..In the Middle East, Central Americab, Asia and now because of what we perceive as the Chineses grab in Africa, we now are finally showing interest in that long negelected continent.","CAF....I agree with you on your point and we in America have a very long history of grabbing land, territories, installing dictators to ensure our direct or indirect control of natural resources and assets and going to war over control of geographical areas deemed to be in our national interest..The two most recent grabs were Iraq, our wanting a large military complex next door to Iran and control in Iraq's oil industry, but it did not work out due to armed civil resistance by the Iraqis and world opinion on our naked aggression, and Afghanistan, where rare earth minerals and to thwart Chinese gains in developing mining with the Afghans are our regarded as paramount to our government's national interest...Right or wrong, Putin is doing just what Bush Jr., Cheney and now Obama do. ..In the Middle East, Central Americab, Asia and now because of what we perceive as the Chineses grab in Africa, we now are finally showing interest in that long negelected continent.",,,,,,,

James,,,,"Honestly, Mr. Cohen.  If you and your family wish to go to battle with Mr. Putin on the basis of his threat to you and your family, please go ahead.  The moment Mr. Putin represents any real threat to the United States, I am sure we will collectively rise to the occasion.  The use of our forces for so many unworthy and immoral causes over the past two decades has, however, increased our scrutiny of what represents an honest threat.","It's always better to talk with your adversaries than not, but if the President agrees to a meeting with Putin, it should be on his terms, not those of the Russian leader.  It is obvious that Putin wants to use his UN foray to legitimize himself once again with the civilized world, and to try and talk with the big boys about Syria while giving Ukraine short shrift.  Obama shouldn't let him. The topics of the discussion should be agreed beforehand, as well as the report (known as a communique) on whatever results were achieved, just as in the Soviet era.  By the way, since we are agreeing to take Syrian refugees, why not ask Russia to do the same? Also, why not ask Putin to agree to re-admit OSCE election observers to future Russian elections?  That ought to spice up the conversation.","One can see why certain Polish politicians, including ex-Speaker Sikorski, have been so critical of U.S. support to date. If this is the best we can manage sixteen months after the covert Russian conquest of Crimea, the invasion of Eastern Ukraine, and increasingly threatening moves  by Putin's Russia against our Eastern NATO allies, maybe Sikorski's scatalogical description of U.S.-Polish relations was not too far off the mark.","What possible good could come from taunting the Russians, who have suffered more death and destruction by invading forces than anything the US has ever endured?  Mr. Putin cleverly uses the genuine fears and memories of his country to generate a national paranoia that is not unlike the fears created by the Bush Administration as a ploy to engage in wars of opportunity.  In Putin's case, however, he has a legitimate point: NATO and western forces continue to surround Russia.  As was true for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the only possible beneficiaries from this new action are the military contractors, who generate obscene profits whenever they can send in more heavy equipment.","Putin's call to postpone the separatist referendum is one of three logical choices he had. The second was to invade Eastern Ukraine right now, using the violence in Donetsk, Odessa and elsewhere as an excuse. This latter choice would be a serious mistake, since it might harden the Europeans against Putin and make Russia even more quickly into the pariah state it is gradually becoming. Endorsing the running of the May 11 referendum would also be a serious mistake, since a majority of Eastern Ukrainians still favor staying in Ukraine, and because the referendum itself will be chaotic, violent, and most likely sparsely attended.  Putin also had a third logical choice, which he has evidently made, to continue building separatist power in Eastern Ukraine until such time as any referendum, if it is run, will yield the desired result. In the meantime, there will be plenty of opportunities for increasing the pace of destabilization operations, and for gathering up any political advantages that result. All the more reason for the Obama Administration to get more aggressive in its Ukraine policy, and to provide the Kyiv government with the wherewithal to purge its military and security ranks of fifth columnists, while building up the remaining force to enable it to take back those areas of the country that have fallen to the separatists.","Goodness, yes!  The one thing we don't want is a Ukraine that is able to defend itself!  Better to rely on Putin's generosity and sense of fairness. That should work out very well.","Negotiations from a position of weakness will always fail with someone like Putin.  He will just view it as an invitation to further aggression.  The U.S. and the West must be realistic and take a stand now, recognizing that such a confrontation is inevitable -- it is only a question of whether it occurs sooner or later.  Critics say that if we supply Ukraine with the arms it needs to survive, Putin will just double down and we'll be back to where we started, or that we will somehow get into a war with Russia.  These are valid concerns, but both are oversimplifications. There are limits to what Putin can and will do. Putin wants war no more than we do, because it would threaten his own destruction. Moreover, the Russian people will not be forever blind to the carnage that Putin's policies are wreaking on the Russian economy, and to the increasing isolation of Russia itself. There will come a time when Putin will have to make a rational calculation of his own interests, and stop blindly lashing out, as he has up until now. This will be a long-term struggle, but eventually, if Ukraine is given the ability to resist, Putin will fail. The West is not being asked to fight, just to give Ukraine the tools to fight.  Unlike Iraq or Afghanistan, the people of Ukraine actually want to be part of the West and are asking for our help.  If we forsake them, we are giving up on everything we stand for,","you forgot the most likely outcome, Putin takes at least 50 of the Ukraine and Obama talks about it.  In the history of mankind, there have been dictators and thugs like Putin.  Saddam,Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Ho, Castro, etc. and all of these could spot a weak enemy immediately, one they can ignore and run over.  Unfortunately, Obama is the weakest of the weak and has destroyed all respect for the US in the world.  This actually encourages dictators to be aggressive and Putin will therefore do exactly as he wants and could care not one iota what Obama thinks or says.","I keep hearing the mantra that Putin is a chess player and that he has carefully calculated all his moves against Ukraine and the West.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Putin's actions against Ukraine were not calculated at all -- they were a visceral reaction after his ill-considered and brutal plan to keep Yanukovych in power in Kyiv blew up in his face.  Putin has been lashing out again and again ever since then, and every new setback has not prompted the least bit of reflection on his part.  Putin is interested in three things: retaining and building on his power, safeguarding his cut of Russia's oil revenues and those of his closest allies, and building up Russia's military power.  You will notice that concerns about the Russian people are nowhere in his thoughts, and because of this they are descending into economic distress unprecedented in this century.  Putin is a bully who must be made to understand that doubling down on a bad strategy will not solve his problems.  The West, and specifically the United States, need to keep up the economic pressure on Russian and provide Ukraine with the economic and military power to resist Putin.  Otherwise, Ukraine will not be the last of Russia's neighbors to be victimized by Putin and his kleptocracy.","Putin has just trapped himself -- again.  As usual, he is engaging in a tactical push for temporary advantage, but where is the long-term strategy? I think we can take it as a given that Putin is increasing Russian involvement in Syria to prop up Assad, deflect attention from Ukraine, and build up a new enemy to keep the Russian people distracted from their economic malaise.  I think we can also assume that Russian forces will be attacking targets that threaten Damascus directly as well as Russian forces in and around Latakia.  It turns out that most of these are not ISIS, but other groups, including some that we support. The best thing we can do at this point is to come to a working arrangement with the Russians that will de-conflict our military activities in Syria, and then let Putin and Assad stew in their own juice.  This kind of Soviet-style Afghanistan-lite intervention has all the hallmarks of long-term catastrophe. What happens when truck bombs start hitting Russian bases in Syria and Russian aircraft, and their pilots are shot down and perhaps captured by the Islamic State? What does Putin do then  step up his intervention?  Putins course is a useful diversion for a few months, but there is no endgame, except perhaps an eventual de-escalation by Russia followed by military involvement in some new crisis.  This is no way to run a railroad."

Who needs all of those problems and all of those bills? But it is correct to think Putin won't let Donbass go. It is leverage against a Ukraine tied to NATO that is looking increasingly hostile. It would also be very damaging to his public image to look sit idly by and watch as a natural constituency is liquidated. This is precisely why arming Ukraine is such a bad, bad idea. Kiev isn't going to win this one. Arming it will only prolong their eventual defeat, make the threat of catastrophic escalation more likely,and leave the US and Europe with massive PR problem similar to what the US had coming out of Vietnam. Coddlers and enables of a corrupt and murderous regime. The fact is the Kiev regime is a venal flock of criminals that deserves to fail.

Why is anyone mystified?..We will never know Putin's entire list of motivations for taking over Crimea, and for eventually subjugating Ukraine (after much harassment).  But some motivations are clear:.Chief among them: send a clear message that Russia will tolerate no pro-western (NATO) regime on his border, nor a democratic one - lest it infects the nice kleptocracy he has produced in Russia.  Governments that loot and pillage the country (Ukraine), but are pro Russia are welcome.  What he is saying is: See what I did in Chechnya (not a peep for anyone that mattered), Georgia (not a whimper), and now Ukraine (go ahead, make my day, your sanctions will hurt you more than me).  If I can do it to them, I can do it to you)...Ukraine is Russia's Granada...I know we are losing because Strobe Talbot announced that this is going to hurt Russia in the long run.  Hmmm, that is the victim's way of consoling ourselves that even though we could do nothing, eventually GOD will intervene and hurt the oppressor.  Nice one Strobe!..I am rediscovering the wisdom of Reagan (do everything to tell the Russians and others that we have secret weapons (like star wars, when we really do not), act crazy and with certitude (arm the Mujaheddin), double the arsenal, and send ships and planes to buzz the Soviets at every opportunity, so that everyone is convinced that if they step out of line, they get nuked).  Yes, it is morally corrupt, but it seemed to have worked...Kalidan","That a people would want to join the embrace of mother Russia when they have their own independent republic, and are willing to take up arm and go for broke speaks volumes for the kind of independent nation Ukraine became, the way the leaders ran the country (basically stole everything including stuff that was nailed down), and the unemployment and deep alienation of ethnic Russians they caused...Putin has a very clear aim; to invalidate NATO.  To do so, he has to ensure that the countries on his border (buffer states) are in chaos, and NOT aligned with the west.  In a short while, he is going to invade a small NATO country.  I think Latvia.  ..When NATO does little, it (and other notions of western, democratic alliances) will be weakened, perhaps irreparably.  West zero, Putin game set and match...I will leave the smart people I see on TV spewing well rehearsed cliches and non-sequiters to solve this problem.

I suppose Putin is doing what he can do; the sanctions we impose trigger bolder, more galling responses that clash with our espoused values...That we do not live our espoused values (capitalism, freedom, democracy, law and order); that we say one thing and do another (culture of dependency, government sponsored snooping, support for military dictators and monarchies, and refusal to tame our robber baron class) - and do so rather shamelessly, is another matter...What I am learning is this.  To the extent we believed, after WWII, that American values will prevail in the world, that people will clamor for freedom because it is their innate instinct, that democracy is the best form of government - we may have well passed the sell by date.  ..American think tanks (I hope the Heritage Foundation is paying attention) must think through a discontinuity, and their fundamental notions of the current reality.  The logic that drives others (Europe, Middle East, Russia, China, Latin America) is opaque to us, hence our actions (sanctions, bombing, supporting coups and plots, foreign aid) do not produce the consequences we think they will.  ..Back to the drawing board - ye thinkers...Kalidan","Today Putin is winning.  Because his mind seems uncluttered, and he is clearly focused on profit.  He has an airbase, and active operations in Syria.  He gets to sell (not give away, like we do) his arms and munitions to nearly a billion people, all intent on using it for one purpose or another.  ..Much of our thinking about Syria (indeed all Arab countries) is tethered to some ill-advised notions of moderate Arabs.  Moderate Arab has less and less of a real world analog.  So poorly do we understand this market, that we have developed a product no one wants (freedom and democracy at gunpoint).  Putin seems free from such nonsensical notions. ..We lost because our policies and actions were dictated by paranoid neocons, by our naive belief that people will choose to live free.   Putin's policies and actions are informed by his success in Chechnya (where he has managed to completely tame and neuter Islam and Islamicists, who currently cower under him), driven by his desire to keep himself in power, and by his need to ensure that his generals and circle of oligarchs profit (from sale of arms).  He has found a market (Middle East and all of Africa) for his arms now. ..Yes, he is winning.","The west gets to declare victory, and everyone goes home.

First, Mr. Putin does not seem to care about alienating Ukrainians.  Second, it is not like Ukrainians have real choices; aligning with the west is silly when the west has no will nor ability to ensure their safety.  So they can cry in the wilderness for all the difference it will make.  Third, Obama means well; but Putin does not have to look much beyond Afghanistan to know this is hot air from Washington.  Ukes do not have a formidable lobby in Washington for it to matter to the US...Looks like Putin knows exactly what he is doing, and will likely get the outcomes he imagines he will.  He is betting on the world community to say, oh well, we tried, and let it go at that.  It is unimportant how I know that; take a look at how the Ukrainians are responding.  It should tell us that THEY know that...Kalidan",,
natan,,,,"Yes, because nothing good ever came from defeating Hitler and liberating Europe by military means. And of course we all know that minorities will be best protected by Putin's Russia invading Europe and breaking up the EU.","How about Russia backing off from its borders with NATO? Russia is already attacking civilian ships in the Baltic. NATO nations have every right to prepare themselves and put their arms wherever they want in THEIR territory. And yes, if Mexico wanted Russian bases in its territory there is nothing US should do about it. That is a stupid analogy too.  Liberals supporting Putin don't understand the concept of suverenity. It is the Baltic states that get to decide about their own defense and membership.  US liberals are nostalgic for USSR and totalitarianism. This is a good time for the Putin loving leftists to keep quiet.","While I strongly disagree with pro Putin leftists who claim that the West has no right to put its armies to its own territory by the Russian border, I do agree with commentators saying that EU is not contributing enough to its defense. I agree that the US should not pay all the bills for the Baltic states. That's just unfair. But NATO must exercise its main duty - defense of all memberstates.","There are two concepts here that pro-Putin US leftists don't understand: territorial sovereignty and democratic decision-making. Eastern members of NATO have every right join any international organization that would take them. So they have joined the democratic clubs, the EU and the NATO, rather than the totalitarian, xenophobic Russian regime that had been enslaving and killing them for half a century. They have as much right to put defensive weapons anywhere in their free, democratic lands, as does Russia in its own territory. The Putin loving American leftists don't want to recognize borders between democracy (EU, NATO) and totalitarian Russian Federation.  ..The Cuban crisis is a very bad analogy, unless you want to convince anyone that the point of putting NUCLEAR weapons to Cuba was to defend Cuba.  The Russian bases in Mexico hypothetical is even more disingenuous. If for some reason Mexico wanted to have them in their territory, on there side of the Frontiera, they would indeed have every right to host them. That's why there are borders. It is becoming very obvious that American liberals want totalitarian USSR to come back and continue slaughtering democratic nations, with no regard to their territorial sovereignty.   <a hrefhttps:twitter.comFluidEyes titlehttps:twitter.comFluidEyes targetblank>https:twitter.comFluidEyes<a>","By getting closer to the West Ukraine can still win the day. Learning from European successes and failures Ukraine can have a nice fresh start within Western democratic world. ..However, joining the EU is not a serious option for Ukraine. The next expansion of the EU will not happen in the foreseeable future, if ever. The EU is concerned with its own survival right now and some member states are getting loose (UK)... Neither would joining the EU necessarily help with killing of the corruption. It did not do much for Bulgaria nor Romania (in terms of corruption at least). But that does not mean that Ukraine cannot become a close partner with the West (whatever the West means these days). Ukrainians should continue fighting for democratic values (number one: protection of minorities), education and anti-corruption. This fight is just starting. ..There may be major sacrifices though. Putin is playing a game similar to Milosevic's in former Yugoslavia: supplying the Russian ethnic minority in Ukraine with hate and ammunition without getting directly involved. Ukraine may face a break-up. But this will not be the end of it. Let the smart join the stronger (the West) and then help the rest from the safe side of the border.","Russia is one big red state. The urban elites understand everything that Tom is saying here. (I don't mean the oligarchs but rather most educated folks in Russia.) Russia is a textbook case of the tyranny of the majority. That is, the tyranny of the rural romantics. ..Russia has enough of young talent to become a superpower and Putin knows this. He and his rural red state supporters don't want this! They don't want Russia to become powerful on the global stage at all. They want their irrational, rural, romantic values to persevere. Nothing else.",,,,

Heshe has it 100 correct...If Putin were to expand into other areas of Ukraine that would be a different matter, of course.  But I predict he won't, he's not that stupid.  A boor perhaps, but not a twit.","Hey Hillary, what happened?  Putin doesn't seem to be behaving like a Hitler after all?..Hillary, please don't be the Democratic pres. candidate in '16 or I'll have to go third-party.","Time for the West to stop its various forms of saber-rattling.

Aslan,,,,There are no Western forces in Ukraine.  Putin admits there are Russian forces in Ukraine.,"What really steams me isn't just the way Putin is acting  in Ukraine -- as someone who happens in fact to be an American citizen who really values free access to information, free expression and  a relatively free press, it's pretty annoying when the New York TImes comment section is being used by Russia, an authoritarian country and the clear aggressor in Ukraine, as part of its information campaign.  The Russian government plants comments on media web sites.  That's pretty clearly established -- just use a google search and you'll see articles in the Guardian and the Atlantic about it.  Russian Anonymous released a lot of emails about it.  And it's pretty clear from reading the comments here that a lot of them are part of that effort.  I admit, it gets me angry.  Now, I doubt that comments on web sites are going to do much to influence public opinion, but still -- it's dishonest, callous and really, really annoying.","I am sure the comment section would be much different if we could see the actual country of residence of each person posting a comment...What Putin is doing in Ukraine is outrageous: because he doesn't like the politics of the Ukrainian government -- and wants to ensure there's no chance of a Maidan in Moscow -- he has invaded Ukraine, annexed part of its territory, sent people in to stir up trouble (remember the guy from Moscow who took a selfie raising the Russian flag over city hall in Kharkiv?), organized self-defense forces that have kidnapped elected officials and European observers.  ..And closer to home, it appears that the manipulation of the story in Russian media has extended to the comment sections of western news sites.  Recently the Guardian reported on emails leaked by the Russian Anonymous group detailing efforts to use dead souls -- false internet posters in news and social media sites -- to discredit those who oppose Putin.  ..So who is posting here?","Dear commentators: If Putin's actions in Ukraine are permissible, what, then, is prohibited?",There is no good that can come from this tragedy.  But at least now the world has truly had a look into Mr. Putin's soul.,"There are many in Eastern Ukraine who do not support separatism.  If it were possible to hold a fair referendum, that would be a legal way forward; but when unidentified people with guns are taking over police stations, there's no way to hold a far and legitimate referendum...Putin's goal is instability, making Ukraine chaotic and unreliable and therefore an unlikely candidate for western institutions like the EU.  Simple annexing the region might have worked in Crimea, which is easily isolated, but military occupation doest work so well in eastern Ukraine.    But then, Putin doesn't really care about the people in Donetsk and Lugansk.  He just wants to make sure Ukraine stays divided and weak.","Of course he blames his own aggressive moves on The West.  But isn't it worrisome that Putin says he will defend Russian-speaking people wherever they live?  What if a French leader said he will defend French-speakers wherever they live?  Or if an American President said he would intervene on behalf of English-speakers wherever they live?..Putin has shown himself capable of invading sovereign countries and annexing parts of them, and he claims a right to military action to defend people who speak Russian wherever they live.  That is very, very dangerous.","I see no venom regarding Putin in this reporting -- it's pretty factual.  And isn't it kind of unfair to the NYT, which does a pretty good job of honest reporting, to claim that they're defaming Russia or Putting?..Perhaps the answers to these few simple questions will help clarify the position of the NYT (which is not that different from just about every other newspaper outside of Russia in covering Ukraine): Who was it who invaded Ukraine?  Who annexed part of Ukraine?  What legal basis was there for any of this?","For those writing on behalf of the Russian government and suggesting a referendum for Eastern Ukraine: perhaps first there should be a referendum on Kaliningrad, where Poles and Germans get to vote on that territory that has been occupied by Russia since 1945?  Or perhaps a referendum in Chechnya and Ingushetia?  The Far East?  ..If Putin opens that Pandora's Box he'll wish he hadn't.","If they were Ukrainians and not imported mercenaries, perhaps.  But Russia itself has generated so much confusion with its games of smoke and mirrors in Ukraine it is impossible to tell what people want.  They probably want an end to war 00 in fact, the reason there are Russian merenaries carrying on the way in Ukraine is that the local people no longer want to do so, and that doesn't suit Mr. Putin's purposes at all...If Putin plays fair -- and I have some doubts that he can after a life of duplicity and double-dealing, first in the KGB and then in Russian politics -- then everyone else might be able to play fair as well.  As it stands, he is the one who's brought matters to such a state, and he is the one who should make it stop."

The approach is the opposite if Crimea, but the result will be the same: part of Ukraine will become Russian soil.  The question: What become of  western Ukraine after that pro-longed land grab. Does Putin stop? My guess is that he keeps pressuring until he is forced to stop. He will look to all of Ukraine, make sure that it  is in continued disarray, and inch by inch.....At some point the EU and The United States will have to directly help Poroshenko with military aid.

And let the  United States help Germany and England. We have led far too often when it comes to policing of the world, and we have no business crossing the Atlantic to police this conflict. We should provide money and aid, let the EU supply military support for the beleaguered Ukrainian Army. Russia has broken international law by taking over Crimea and using unmarked soldiers and equipment to try and over Ukraine. Putin will back-peddle if confronted with extreme sanctions and a coalition of EU force. More than that: Russian Oligarchs will back peddle.","By the end of this, I wouldn't be surprised if the oligarchs in Russia hold a secret meeting with the goal of ousting Putin. He has ruined Russia's reputation with his behavior in Ukraine. If Putin supplied the weaponry, Russia should pay restitution to the families, and apologize. But he won't do this.  It would serve Putin well in this crisis not to act defensive. He should acknowledge the possibilities and work with all countries to find the truth; hedging on any of that digs a bigger hole for him to try and crawl out of--but, I don't think he'll find his way out of this one.",How can anyone trust Putin to follow these agreements? He breaks rules and treaties at every turn. He can't be trusted. It sounds like he is asking Poroshenko to clear artillery out of eastern Ukraine so he can move in without conflict.,"A smoke screen. Remember the other headline today, posted at the bottom of this one: Putin Asserts Right to Use Force in Eastern Ukraine. He already has a plan to assert this right, the wheels are in motion.","Ukraine is helpless against the Russian supported militia, or better, the Russian army without insignia. It looks like the western strategy is to slap the wrist with sanctions and let Putin have eastern Ukraine, maybe all of Ukraine. If that is the case, we are entering a new era of imperialism, where despots can expand borders, Crimea-style, into weak countries, and democratic leaders will only sanction, for fear of nuclear retaliation. Soon we will need 5 star generals with PHDs in global economics. Still, the western generals must have a military plan if Putin goes too far--but, what is too far?"

Art,,,,"The hypocrisy the NYT is showing is stunning. Eleven years ago you made a foolish decision to support President Bush on the criminal Iraq invasion--attacking a country 10,000 miles away, that posed no threat to the US. Now you are condemning PutinRussia for meddling in Ukraine (which, of course, he is)...You supported 200,000 troops pouring into Iraq, yet you are distressed that maybe 1000 Russian troops are in a country right on their border. You turned a blind eye while the US killed maybe 50,000 in Iraq, yet you are outraged that Russia has killed maybe 5000 in Ukraine...There was a coup against an elected president (a thug) in Ukraine, aided and abetted by the US. What would you be saying if Russia had done that in Mexico? You apparently believe that the US can do anything it wants if it feels its security is threatened anywhere in the world, but the Russians cannot send tanks into Ukraine...In the case of Ukraine, the US and NATO have purposefully provoked Russia for 25 years, and now you have the gall to object if Russia reacts to the provocations...Yes, Putin is lying about Russian activity in Ukraine, but as a liar, he's an rank amateur compared to President Bush and Iraq...You are foolish to be supporting the arrogant provocation of Russia, a country with 8000 nuclear warheads, and the means to deliver them. You are blindly supporting a course that could lead to a global catastrophe. Remember the foolish moves and misjudgments by great empires that led to WW1.",Instead of the vague near abroad -- which sounds like it could have originated in a tourist brochure -- why not call the countries abutting Russia by their original and more descriptive name: Russia's sphere of influence. This term would more clearly explain Putin's actions.,"The West will come to regret meddling in this internal Ukrainian dispute. The 20 billion from the IMF is but a band-aid on an economy that has been flat for over 20 years. Compared to Russia, they are poorer now than when the USSR was dissolved, and the Russian-speaking Easterners are well aware of this. They also saw Yanukovych, who they supported through three national elections, thieving thug or not, overthrown and replaced by Westerners...The exports of the industrial East go mainly to Russia; where will these products go if Russia spurns them? Certainly not to Western Europe, where there is little interest in buying them. The financial support required will be far larger than that provided to Greece, with uncertain results. How long will the taxpayers of the West support the hand outs? Not for long, I bet. And when the austerity measures demanded by the IMF starts to bite, some Western Ukrainians, too, will quickly sour on their benefactors...So the US and the EU have encouraged a revolution that has nowhere to go; Putin can just sit back and wait for the inevitable counter-revolution. The US might think it has scored points against Putin and Russia, but this power-politics game is far from over, and in the end I fear it is the Ukrainians who will suffer.",Sounds like a salesman for the military Industrial complex. Does the 5 billion already spent by the National Endowment for Democracy count for anything or was that just used to stirrup trouble..With our pit bull ambassador to the EU making her case in front of a Chevron banner the picture of our intentions could not be clearer. No wonder Putin's approval rating is twice  Obama's.,"where the state dominates the individual Sounds like Washington to me..Machiavelli was right. Waring factions begin to look like each other. The USA stands for Democracy in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan,Yemen, Syria, Venezuela and many more places around the globe. All Putin wants is to reestablish the old Russia.   The USA on the other hand wants a global empire. Where the sun never sets on its territory. Someone also said Power Corrupts.",,,,,

Putin is winning the realpolitick game, which we stopped playing when Bush Jr decided to light the match to the middle east for 'freedom' and 'democracy' - concepts the middle east isn't ready for. Putin is winning the right to clean up the mess in Syria, and he'll take out those we've funded as well as those we want to see eliminated. Let him have it.

Until then, Obama is just testing the waters to see if a lesser penalty would influence Putin. But it will not.","The amoral Putin appears to retreat because economic pain is being suffered by Russia from the very mild sanctions that have been imposed to date. Capital outflow in the first quarter of 2014 is estimated to be about 30 billion, the stock market has dropped 20 and the ruble depreciated 8. Russian interest rates have spiked to 7.5 and the IMF considers the economy to be in recession with 2014 growth at 0.2. Inflation is estimated to be 7 to 10. Foreign investment in Russia has dropped to near zero and continued capital flight will cause serious damage. Russia manufactures next to nothing that the rest of the world wants to buy and is reliant on gas and oli exports..If Obama and the EU leaders really wanted to hurt Russia badly, Russian access to the Bank of International Settlements can be denied. The Russian economy will collapse. But Ukraine and some countries in eastern Europe would also suffer a lot of pain. The threat is there. ..Putin and his KGB coterie are an amoral dictatorship.

The tug of war may go on for decades.","The U.S. forgets that In 1867, Russia sold Alaska to the U.S. for 5 million. It was called Sewards Folly and the Democrats, who were out of power, were predictably scandalized...Crimea is Russias only warm water port. The czars spent centuries in southern expansion to finally, in 1783, get Sevastapool and the Crimea...Putin and the rest of Russian elite are still suffering from the collapse of empire in 1992 and the loss of so much Soviet territory. And Kruschachev, according to The Economist, only transferred to Eastern Ukraine (including the Crimew) to the Soviet Republic of the Ukarain when drunk in a fit of guilt when as Stalins director of the Ukraine, he starved to death some 5 million Ukranians when Stalin ordered all their wheat seized so he could sell it for hard currency...Ukraine has existed as a state since 1992. This is the start of a long battle to see if the Ukraine will fall back under the Russian dictatorship or join Europe. The battle may not end for 100 years...Sell the Crimea to Putin for 500 billion, paid in gold and oil. He will be happy and so will the Ukranians.","The big question is will the US directly challenge Putin as Russia bombs ant-Assad areas?..In the same way that Hitler challenged the European democracies in the 1930's, Putin is betting that the U.S. will essentially do nothing...The annexation of Crimea and what is really a Russian intrusion into eastern Ukraine have resulted in rather ineffective Western sanctions. What is the U.S. going to do when Putin continues to bomb all forces opposed to Assad? Send a strong letter?..The West has its chance to rid itself of Assad and did nothing in Syria for three years. Remember Obama's red line? I do not think Obama even owns a red pen. Assad is in power for the indefinite future.","Putin is a KGB spy. The ruling elite of Russia are his friends from the KGB. People like this are calculating, clever and entirely amoral. There is nothing that is not permitted...Putin called the collapse of the USSR the greatest tragedy of the 20th century, conveniently overlooking WW I, many European colonial wars, Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Japanese Imperialism, WW II and the nuclear arms race...The collapse of the USSR was the sudden end of empire for Russians. Kiev was the original home of the mythic Ruirikuran dynasty, lost in the mists of time in the Russian creation myth, lost to the Mongols and then to the Polish Lithuanian empire. Kiev was returned to Russia 1686 when it was ceded under an agreement for perpetual peace by the Polish-Lithuanian empire to the tsars in Moscow. The tsars drove south to the Black Sea for access to a warm water port, achieving success in 1783. The Crimean War (1851) and later the Congress of Berlin (1878) were all about slowing or halting Russian southern expansion...Last week's Economist magazine had a cover showing a map with Russia turned into a bear, already with Crimea in its throat, opening its jaws to swallow Ukraine. This game will be played out over the coming decades, if not longer. What Ukraine needs, in spite of the corrupt members of the Rada and its oligarchs, is economic and cultural support from, and inclusion with, the West. Another Great Game has started...Sanctions can never work too well.","Is Putin using propaganda more than the Western media? It is hard to find a rational voice as Putin, the new czar in the Kremlin, tries to scrabble back what the USSR lost in 1992 when it collapsed...From the Russian point of view, the Ukraine has been theirs since 1783. it is not as if Britain and France did not fight against the loss of empire. Does anyone in the U.S. recall how America the Great got involved in Viet Nam after Dien Ben Phu?..If the natural gas problem in Europe could be solved, the Europeans might be brave enough to consider stronger sanction at the beginning of what is likely to be a decades long tussle over whether the Ukraine, or part of it, will be European or Russian."
Thinker,,,,"A commenter suggests that overt US aid to the Ukrainian government would force Putin to be public in Russia's aid to the Donbass rebels...Well, of course it would -- but so what? ..If, for example, the US starting sending arms to the Ukraine, Putin might announce that Russia will reciprocate by sending arms to the rebels. If the US sends troops to the Ukraine (don't hold your breath), Putin might announce that Russia will reciprocate by sending in Russian troops. ..Hardly surprising. So what?",This commenter incorrectly assumes that everyone who thinks Putin is behaving rationally necessarily believes Putin is a nice guy:..Let's for a moment grant the premise of so many posts here that Putin is a peace-loving democrat who was forced into the ways and byways of land theft by the evil machinations of the US...I don't assume Putin is either a nice guy or not a nice guy. I simply observe that he's behaving as one would expect in these circumstances -- whether he's a nice guy or not.,The best way to reason is to start with your conclusion and then work your way backwards to the facts that you need to support it:..This is the same man Putin who authorized the downing of Malaysia Flight 17 killing all 298 civilians and crew on board just over a year ago.,"It is time to call Putin's military moves. He has no money. ... Good timing...We, on the other hand, have gobs and gobs of money to spend on this. ..Some people worry that this war will only add to our 18 trillion national debt (75 times as much as Russia's). Pssshaw! This war won't cost us a dime. None of our wars do. We just borrow the money from our grandchildren, who, of course, get no say in the decision. Their time will come, though: In 50 years or so, THEY can start wars and have THEIR grandchildren pay for them.","Russia is already attacking civilian ships in the Baltic...Hey, it's a lot worse than that! Haven't you heard? Putin ordered the shoot-down of the Malaysia Airlines plane. And there are columns of Russian troops rolling through the eastern Ukraine, heading straight for Kiev!..I am not making this up. I was just about to post some videos on YouTube - for those skeptical types who insist on what they call evidence. But then something went wrong with my camera and all the videos got erased. I'm sure Putin was behind that too...And this isn't just recent. Remember how everyone used to blame everything on Qaddafi, and before him on the Ayatollah Khomeini? Well, Qaddafi's been dead for 4 years now, and Khomeini a lot longer than that. But this stuff is still happening. ..Makes you stop and think, doesn't it?","NATO has a treaty obligation to defend the Baltics if they are attacked by Russia. Certainly NATO need not wait until Russian troops are streaming across the border. It's common, and useful, when tensions are building, when aggressive troops are threatening a small country, to make a gesture like this -- symbolic or more -- that tells the aggressor you mean business...But when a gesture is made WITHOUT any aggressive act having occurred, then the gesture will be misinterpreted by many to mean that some act of aggression has in fact occurred. That's what's objectionable about this symbolic gesture: those who don't know better mistakenly interpret it to mean that Russia has been behaving aggressively toward the Baltics. It hasn't, nor against any other NATO member. Various commenters allege this, but you'll notice that's all they do -- allege it. Ever wonder why we never see photographs of all those Russian troops that Putin is sending into the Ukraine? Simple: he's not -- or, if he is, he's certainly hiding it well.","Commenter Alex (who says he's from Russia) wonders this:..I'm wondering why Russia and Vladimir Putin is called aggressor...A well-known US environmentalist, Bill McKibben, made an apt observation, albeit in a different setting (he was trying to mobilize support against the Keystone XL Pipeline):..A movement requires enemies...The US government can't whip us into a frenzy just to fight terror   they need to point to actual terrorists  preferably with long dark beards, turbans and dirty, ragged clothes. Nor can they whip us into a frenzy just to fight expansion of Russia into Eastern Europe. Much too boring! They need to personify the enemy, and that's what Putin is for.","A common argument is that, while this step is largely symbolic, it shows clear resolve by NATO to stand up to the Russians if they try to take over Eastern Europe...Two problems with that argument:..1. I think Putin already gets this. As he said, any Russian leader who attacks a NATO country would have to be insane and dreaming. That's true, whether he thinks so or not, and I suspect he thinks so...2. Even if we are correct to believe Putin needs to see some symbolic expression of our resolve to honor our NATO treaty obligations, this expression is awfully feeble. We risk having Putin reach the opposite conclusion. If there ever is an actual battle over the Baltic countries (which I doubt), the stuff we're seeing in these photos and reading about in this article would be so useless that I doubt we'd ever actually use it. And the Russians would just laugh at us if we did.","If someone can meaningfully distinguish between walking away from the Baltic states, and Germany's bloodless (to the outside) acquisition of Czechoslovakia in 1938, I'm listening...You're listening? Good. ..Hitler had his army waiting at the border to attack Czechoslovakia and take it over. Russia doesn't have its army at the border of the Baltic states, ready to take them over. ..See the difference? ..Many commenters SAY Russia has its army at the border of the Baltic states, ready to take them over, but that's not actually true. They just made that up...See the difference?..Putin says Russian leaders would have to be insane and dreaming to try to attack a NATO country. I have no idea whether Putin really believes that, but I sure do. If that happened, the US would fire up its bombers in a heartbeat. And these silly little tanks you see in these photos, and the other military hardware described in this article, would be utterly irrelevant if that occurred. I seriously doubt their engines would even be started...See the difference?","Another commenter nails it:..This has nothing to do with Russian aggression but in fact is simply an angry American response to the Russian refusal to recognize an illegitimate Kiev government installed by American treachery...The Ukraine's elected president had indicated his intention to sign a deal with the EU, but Russia made him a better offer and he changed his mind. The US thereupon backed a group of his opponents who promised to sign with the EU if they got control of the Ukrainian government -- which, of course, they did, once the elected president was forced by the violence to flee the country...To that point, the coup leaders and their US backers were having a good time -- it was all kinda fun. But Putin saw an opportunity. He'd long felt the Crimea should never have been given to the Ukraine. He wanted it back, and he knew the Crimean people would back him if asked. So he promptly pointed out that the Ukraine no longer had a legitimate government and opined that that was reason enough for the Crimean people to decide which country they wanted to be part of. The Crimeans voted overwhelmingly in favor of Russia and asked to be annexed by Russia. Russia was only too happy to oblige. ..Many critics say Russia would have annexed the Crimea even if the Crimeans had voted to stay in the Ukraine. Maybe Russia would have -- I don't claim to know. The question is academic, though, since the vote was a foregone conclusion: the Crimeans have long preferred Russia."
CommonCents,,,,"The alternative speculation is that Putin is pushing the Kiev regime to the edge of totalitarian militarism; and will use the riveting image of the siege of Stalingrad in WWII to rescue trapped Russians in Donetz with overwhelming military force...Ukraine's air force and ground forces would be swept away in a matter of days, unless Obama can convince NATO to commit military forces and strike inside Russia or turn Ukraine into a rubble zone. Never forget who has tactical nukes and a nearly untouchable delivery system!","This wasn't a complete surprise when analyzed from a strategic perspective. Russia has a major highway running down the Coast to Crimea, on one side are ports on the other farms; this provides fast supply routes and difficult for UK. to supply from the North...Then you have the potential of Russian Navy offensive fire and missile power; as well as using landing craft to move APC's tanks, rocket launchers, etc.....all protected by the Russian airforce operating from Crimea and Russia...Even worse, if they secure a strip down to Crimea they can effect a pincher movement against Doentsk...Again this is a brilliant maneuver by Putin &amp; co.","Putin played the democracy card artfully with his referendum on succession; I wonder if he consulted Scottish or Quebec diplomats on the virtues of holding a vote on the matter...Kerry and Obama, on the other hand are reliving the cold war politics and making a mess out of everything; from giving legitimacy to a coup which overthrew an elected President, to a version of playground brinkmanship that has pundits around the world laughing at Kerry's 'dares'.",,,,,,,

Rob Polhemus,,,,"The key fallacy in Douthat's column and in American propaganda is this: After Crimea . . . its clear that Putins Russia is not a flawed Western power, but an anti-Western power with a different, darker vision of global politics.   But all fair-minded Americans will recognize that in the 21st century, no vision of global politics has been darker or more murderous than the Bush-Cheney vision that brought about the needles deaths of hundreds of thousands in Iraq, destroying that country, which had nothing to do with 911.  Putin may be deeply flawed, but he is obviously less violent, less dangerous, and more rational than Cheney and Bush running the ruinous, incompetent but deadly rogue-state America in the century's first decade.  We may not like Russia, but obviously it has been much less immoral than the the killer USA in the present century.  Can someone explain why honoring the wish of the Crimean people to join Russia, done without casualties so far, is not a thousand times less evil than invading Iraq, occupying it and killing tens of thousands of innocent people?","It is obvious that McFaul is dedicated to American-sponsored regime change in Russia.  That's his big hope:  Rich Russians will get control of their country, make deals with Western oligarchs, as in the shameful days of Yeltsin, and do our bidding as our propagandists define it. What makes this article piece and American propaganda in general so sad, however, is the diminishment and slander directed against the crimean people who have democratically expressed their will not to be a part of an anti-Russian, Western-bought, power-seizing, fascist-supported, undemocratic Ukraine government.  Are there really americans so disdainful of Crimeans that they would condemn them to take orders from those who came to power by overthrowing an elected government and condemning the official use of the Russian language.  How any American who supported the Cheney-Bush needless bloodbath of innocents in Iraq can have the gall to demonize Putin is startling.  In the 21st century, my America has been a hundred times worse than Putin's Russian in killing  people needlessly on a wide scale--which is the ultimate form of immorality and evil by the standards of nearly all faith and civilizations.  The problem of the United States is not how to get other nations to do what we want, but how to stop purveying needless violence in the world that helps no one but a few rich war and arms profiteers.  The rogue nation of this century is not Russia but the USA.",,,,,,,,
Iver Thompson,,,,"For me what complicates this whole situation is the rationale at the heart of Russia's annexation.  I hear from Washington things like:  Unconstitutional, illegal, land-grab, or just plain wrong . . .  Things like this just shouldn't happen and there's no place for it in a civilized world...Maybe so, but yet if I look no further than say, Israel; where there I see another occupation of lands designated as that of another - the Palestinian West Bank.  This has been the case for years, but somehow the same rationale doesn't apply there.  It's population is predominately non-Jewish which would justify its separation from the state of Israel, just as Putin justifies separating Crimea from Ukraine by the fact that it's population is mostly Russian, but that hasn't deterred Israel from settling in East Jerusalem and the West Bank and maintaining control of what happen inside its borders. ..Since geopolitics seem to be carried out so arbitrarily and precedents only apply if they're convenient for the intended desire at hand, is it any wonder things are confusing and strong consensuses are pretty much  impossible to achieve.","You've got to give credit to Putin for one thing, unlike we Americans he's decisive and acts whereas we'd just sit on our hands and talk ourselves to death, eventually doing nothing at all.  At least he's either right or wrong, whereas we're neither with nothing in between.  Someone once said something about being too tepid and lukewarm, probably it was referring to us.","Time to put Russia's feet to the fire like that of Iran.  Right?..Sure.  For as much as we'd like to talk tough and say stuff like that, what are the chances that we really had any power to actually do anything other than talk...With all are failed attempted and Middle Eastern realignment and spreading of global democratization, all this paper tiger has proven its good for is talk and bluster...Unfortunately for us and the world, our naivety has not gone unnoticed by Putin who appears more than willing to yank the chain of this tiger really hard, knowing full well it hasn't the guts nor the teeth to back up all its cocky and hypocritical self-righteous delusions of grandeur.","One of the worst things that happened for America was the day the USSR dissolved itself under Gorbachev, leaving the US the unrivaled superpower with unchecked power to do anything it pretty much pleased in the absence of our historical comparable nemesis and their warheads to keep us honest...So along those lines, what do you think Francis would have to say to anyone who he saw kick another of once equal strength the second that other person were down and at an unfair advantage over them?..Would he not decry such cowardly and vengeful behavior, probably reminding they who were doing the kicking something like; if not by the grace of God that may just have easily been you on the ground instead, and is that what you would wish the one on top to do to you?..Putin's geopolitical chip is one thing, but that lumberyard as you call  it Tom, much of which can easily be credited to us, so don't dismiss it simply all to Putin's own mind in creating...Just because US doesn't start with a P, like Pope and Putin, is no reason to minimize it so as to completely exclude it from your P  P  global equation for what will make the world a better place for everyone. ..America, too, has plenty to learn from the popes humility . . . ..That is why Putins leadership matters, and so does the popes. ..Now as the world's only top dog, maybe its our leadership that matters more.  Addressing that so as to get that lumberyard off Putin's shoulder, and the rest takes care of itself.","You've got to give credit to Putin for one thing, unlike we Americans he's decisive and acts whereas we'd just sit on our hands and talk ourselves to death, eventually doing nothing at all.

It may be unfortunate for Ukraine when they've come to realize that had Goliath had the kind of nuclear and nonnuclear weaponry that Russia has, that David's lucky strike to Goliath's forehead wouldn't have mattered much, because David would have been blown away before he even could get the rock into his sling...And if Ukraine's figuring on counting on lots of willing allies to come rushing to its aid, what with all the other big messes in the world going on simultaneously, seems a tad bit unlikely...The world's news really is literally getting scarier and scarier every day!","Besides learning Putin is a big believer in God, with his several God only knows references, we're also learning that Snowden has taken to appointing himself the world's surveillance czar.  Guess Russia's the best place for him to be hiding out...Between Putin's seeming unawareness of history and Snowden's perserverating on policing his new duties, it all comes across as so surreal - these two bedfellows chatting like such chums...Snowden, using whatever opportunity he can to keep himself in the limelight; Putin, without a care in the world about invading wherever he wishes.","I certainly see your point Judy, the world only gets better the more power is shown.  Best to immediately stop the thugs in their tracks right where they stand, and shame on for even daring to step out of line in the first place and thus becoming thugs...The only way to get things back as they should be is to get Yanukovch back inside those gilded gates where he rightfully belongs.  And thankfully he had the good sense to previously unleash all those snipers, for who knows how much worse things would have been if he hadn't...Only, and only after the Ukraine is securely back in Putin's lap will order return.  How dare the EU for even thinking there was any place for it in those parts of the world.  No one messes with the motherland -- got that EU!","The only thing more pathetic than Assad himself, is the fact that the whole Syrian region and all its people are being forced to go to hell simply because two major powers being led by mortal men and their egos, aren't willing to get past them.  All this emphasis on that puppet Assad - just a big doofus with a necktie who inherited the keys to his dad's car so now they call him the driver of Syria.  The whole mess there has been reduced into its most simplistic terms of good vs. evil with Assad as the poster-boy face of it.  ..When politicians start acting and talking in those types of terms, it means they haven't a clue as to what the real problem is, much less what to do about it.  I think Putin says it correctly when he talks not about Assad, personally, rather Assad's army as a key controlling force that Syria needs to keep maintained in the short term, simply to allow time to stabilize the situation with ISIS...I despise Assad as a loathsome person too, but the situation is not just about one vile, insecure creature like himself, but rather the millions of innocents whose sad fate it happens to be to have born in a country under such a ruler.","Personally I'm glad Putin is doing this, for without his action it seems the whole chaotic mess over there would just continue to endlessly drag on and on without any definite resolution - right or wrong, who's to say what either is - leaving the entire world to suffer from this excruciating Chinese water torture know as American diplomaticmilitaristic chutzpah.  All we seem to know how to do is devise and make messes that we just walk away from for someone else to clean up after us for.  Maybe that's what Putin thinks he's doing, and maybe it will work.  Clearly we can't and admittedly so, just read the papers to see how clearly that's stated."
harry,,,,"Do any of you people actually care about the Ukrainian people? At least half do not want to be ruled by Russia and especially Putin any longer. Any false equivalency with the US and Canada is delusional. These people have been brutalized by Russian autocrats for centuries. The Crimean war was not that long ago. Now they have been poisoned by Russian ineptitude via Chernobyl, and you want me to believe Vladimir is their friend and benefactor. I'm just surprised they haven't invaded with their WWII tanks yet, like they did to Georgia.",Hogwash. Putin holds all the cards and everyone knows it. Simply negotiate a split of Ukraine east and west. The EU and the US can help western Ukraine become a viable country with far less money than war. Let Putin take ownership of the east. Time will tell if the old soviet model will bring more prosperity than the west can achieve. War is simply not an option. Defeat Putin with prosperity and hope.,"What to do with your hard earned billions? Deposit in the EU, Caribbean,Singapore or even the USA and risk losing it with sanctions.

michjas,,,,Putin's claim to have pulled out is unlikely to convince anyone that he will refrain from consummating the dirty deed In Eastern Ukraine.,I'd guess that Putin believes he has done what he can to convince East Ukrainians to support his cause and this pullback is designed to win legitimacy for a vote that he will claim was not unduly influenced by the Russian military.,"Putin's remarks, which lasted 47 minutes, were interrupted repeatedly by thunderous applause, standing ovations and at the end chants of Russia, Russia. Some in the audience wiped tears from their eyes...This doesn't seem complicated to me.  Putin has resorted to flagrant demagoguery and it has worked.  Why would anyone think that he would stop now?","Putin compares Crimea to Kosovo.  Others cite a series of recent wars,  But when I hear talk of the tragic break-up of the Soviet empire and of the need to protect Russians abroad, I hear an acquisitive message based on Russian destiny that sounds very much like the U.S.'s 19th century belief in manifest destiny, which justified our acquisition of land from sea to shining sea.","Call me an appeaser but I'm not into tough talk about Putin.  It massages the ego of  Americans.  But compared to all but Gorbachev, Putin is pretty moderate.  If we sanction him into a corner, hold his feet to the fire on Ukraine, arm our friends in Kiev, and expose Putin as an emperor with no clothes, dollars to donuts we get someone worse.  It surely will not be Medvedev.  Ukraine is a pawn in a US-Russian conflict and winning the battle could mean losing the war.","For years, China has used mass relocations to gain control over Tibet and the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.  By contrast, Putin is an opportunist who is exploiting Ukrainian turmoil to send in the troops while pretending they're not there.  Next to the devious Chinese, Putin doesn't measure up.  And we would be wise to stop looking back to the Cold War and start pivoting towards the more nefarious threat.","For both East and West, Ukraine is a pawn.  This is nothing new. The Russians, the Poles, and the Germans have all ruled Ukraine.  It has little history as a sovereign nation.  The current conflict is about us and Putin.  And, as bad as Putin is, he's better than any Russian ruler other than Gorbachev, dating back 100 years.  Our purpose should be to limit Putin's aggression, but with great caution..  All-powerful Russian rulers disappear overnight after fundamental failures.  Considering Russia's economic problems, Ukraine could be fundamental for Putin.  And we don't want to find out who is waiting in the wings.","The Bolsheviks pulled Russia out of World War I and a bloody Civil War followed.  The Bolsheviks ultimately won the war with the Ukraine being formed as part of the peace settlement.   The U.S. and the West supported the losing White Army in the Civil War.  Because of this, Putin may soon claim that the Ukraine is just one big Western conspiracy.","The premise here is that Russians are pretending to be East Ukrainian rebels in order to goad Ukrainian forces into conflicts which would justify intrusion by the Russian army.  If Putin wants Russian military incursion into Eastern Ukraine to appear defensive, rather than offensive. the wise response to his deception would be to ignore it and llok the other way.","Putin has amassed a sizable army at the border, but is resorting to what amounts to guerilla warfare.

AC,,,,He Putin wants to be a superpower and meddle wherever he chooses..As opposed to?,"Mearsheimer is wrong. Putin is not of afraid of 'western influence' moving into Ukraine, he is afraid of it moving into Russia.

RidgewoodDad,,,,Putin is telling another sovereign country where they can utilize and locate their military??,"The U.S. looks weak. That's not to say that we are, but Putin must have sized up the world stage and made a decision that the aggression that was taken could be done, and they could get away with it. The U.S. always seems to look weak BECAUSE we are a country that has a conscience. We want to stand up for the poor in the world, and the inequities of humanity when we could (I'm talking the body of our 250 year history, not any individual event). But if symbolism means anything, Putin looks tough. Lavrov is cagey and looks tough. Kerry looks like an appeaser and everyone knows that Obama recognizes that we, as a nation, want to be less involved internationally and help more of our own at home.

Seldom has somebody dropped in on a situation as desperate and terrifying as the Ukraine's current state, and breezily announced that everything is on the right track and that her work there is done. Russia still occupies the Crimea and there is no apparent way of getting them out. Nobody, anywhere - including in the Ukraine - has lifted a finger to stop them. And that's just the outside military threat. The Ukraine has a well-deserved ranking as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.

The entire closing paragraphs sounds like freshman's attempt at finishing the essay question on her Intro to Politics final exam: Pull together a few buzzwords, add a non-sequitur, and close with a vague choice that we have to make, without any reference to who we are or what the supposed choice is.","Excellent column! First of all, there is absolutely no military option-- we are not starting WW III with a nuclear power to defend the Ukrainians, there is no costbenefit analysis that would justify this. And economic sanctions are working and will continue to work. Putin is a de facto dictator who, like most of his ilk, could give a hoot about the vast majority of his people. The Ukrainians know that their only hope for a better future is to draw closer to the West. Some time in the next decade or so, renewable energy is going to cripple Russia's ability to blackmail its neighbors and this will greatly diminish their leverage. Until then, Putin is likely to steal everything that's not nailed down. It is deeply regrettable, but continued sanctions are the West's only real option.","What Obama innately understands are the limits of American power in foreign policy. Nobody likes the butchery that's going on in Syria, but should we commit troops to a third Middle East conflict? No. Putin is a dictator doing what dictators too often do, expanding their empire, but it's not worth starting WW III over. Let economic sanctions play out in Russia and, by all means, let's work towards European energy independence to take that trump card away from Russia. It's not sexy, but it has a decent chance of being effective. Chest thumping makes the chest thumper feel good, but often that's the only positive thing it accomplishes.",,,,,,

And Mr Putin took advantage of that to solidify his control..It is important to note that the dissolution is the political structure but the oligarchs worldwide are still very united..I am not sure about the 1 of American point though. While the military folks are the ones bearing the brunt, the whole nation bears the financial burden. While the rich and the powerful can afford lobbyists, lawyers and accountants, the jobless and the homeless can't even afford food and shelters..I support sensible energy development and export. There is no need to throw in carbon tax even if it is one of your pet project, Mr Friedman. Trying to ask for too much is a sure way to make any initiatives fail. Other than that, you are right, counterbalances in the 21st Century transcend military intervention. But it requires a bit common sense too. While America should continue to commit herself to real progress and advancements, she needs to do some nation building at home. No more Neocons. China is smart enough to learn from The Soviet Union failures. Maybe Russia should learn from China that the longevity of an empire is long term reform, not oligarchism",,,,

Putin's arsenal of misinformation and corruption is looking foolish right now, but I'm sure his thugs will be dealing with the few independent voices in Russia...As for Putin blaming the US for the protests, all the Obama administration is guilty of is taking photo ops with the opposition and turning our backs on both our promises and responsibilities.  ..We lack the foresight to support any grassroots effort for democracy, we'd rather spend resources developing Cuban Facebook programs and other nonsensical, fantasy world endeavors.  ..But apparently that won't stop B.O. &amp; company from taking credit for anything positive that happens in the world (real or imagined), which plays directly into Putin's corner.","Nothing will teach Putin better than a good old fashioned meat grinder...We learnt our humility at the hands of ragtag Iraqi militants, looks like Russia wants a turn at bat...We should be happy to accommodate them and honor our commitments to Ukraine at the same time.","Conspiracy theory much?..Pretty soon you'll be roaming the streets of New York shouting, Kenneth, what is the frequency?..Sometimes things are exactly what they appear to be at face value.

Reader,,,,"I don't see the devil in Putin. I see oil and gas interests in competition with Russian oil and gas, and that is all this is about. I also see Putin has much support from Russians. He must be doing something they approve of. I read about Biden's connection through family to a pipeline company in the Ukraine. Seems like a conflict of interest to me, but if not that, then a definite crony capitalism thing going on. What I can't stand is hypocrisy and I see a boat load of it here... No, NATO isn't going to invade Russia, but its members don't mind marginalizing her. Russia can't be blamed for looking after its own interests. This is happening, if no one noticed, right on Russia's borders. Putin may not be a nice guy, but the Russians have more important standards when it comes to their safety, even if they have the same oligarch and plutocrat problems we have. I don't equate capitalism with democracy. They are not one in the same. We have capitalism in the West, but little democracy left. Commerce runs everything, including our government. True, it always has, but the veil is off for me. The view is clear as a bell. And I am no longer fooled by propaganda for what is just a game of commercial power and control over mostly oil and gas, but not exclusive to that.","The NYT reported of the Ukrainian army using cluster bombs against the civilian population of East Ukrainian cities shows the extremes to which Kiev rulers will go to suppress dissent in Eastern Ukraine. This civil war began last Feb. after the US and EU supported coup. For over 23 years of Ukrainian independence from the USSR, there was no violence. On Sept. 6 the UN reported at least 2,600 deaths in Eastern Ukraine attributing the slaughter to Ukrainian militarys advances to reclaim territory from rebel control- an euphemism for surrounding cities then indiscriminate artillery shelling to kill Ukrainian civilians. The current estimated deaths is 3,700. When the Uranian army was routed by separatists, Poroshenko cried Russian invasion that threatened all Europe, asked to join NATO but was denied by the US and the bellicose commander of NATO. Kiev' army consists of  50 right wing militias and private armies paid by oligarchs. Certainly Russia supports the resistance to perceived border threats and the US reacts similarly to perceived threats in the Western hemisphere. The 50  year US trade embargo of Cuba remains despite UN condemnation &amp; the CIA paid 6.88 million to right-wing groups in Chile to oust elected President Allende.The last U.S. ambassador to the USSR, Jack Matlock, argues that Putin is acting in response to eastward expansion of NATO. How would the US react if Mexico became an armed Russian ally? Why expect Russia to act differently to border threats.","So, someone in the US thinks that it is a fine strategic move to force Putin to lose face by enabling the Ukraine to kill more clandestine Russian soldiers...Could your article please expand on the questions what happens after Putin loses face? If you force Putin to admit it, he will point to the US military aid as justification of his decision. His popularity in Russia will possibly drop from 85 to 82 or even rise...Then what? You will have supplied military aid to a corrupt bankrupt country without any discussion what the next step is after Russia also supports the Eastern Ukraine openly. You discuss fomenting an open war in Europe without any discussion why your strategic concerns give you the right to do so or why the US has strategic concerns everywhere in the world whereas Russia should be happy about neighbouring countries becoming NATO members...How about to discuss at all the questions of what the Eastern Ukrainian and the Crimean population wants or in what way the US has encouraged Kiev to engage the secessionists with the military from the start. In Europe, most people think that there is a right to secede from a country, especially if the central government does not fulfill minimum standards with regards to the treatment of ethnic minorities...Most importantly, how about what final goal you are envisioning. Do you really think that the Eastern Ukrainian people will ever be a happy part of the Ukraine again?","Sanctions against Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the other Gulf States who are funding ISIS and Al Qaeda's allies would be far more useful than continuing to try to tangle with Putin over Ukraine...The current Ukrainian government, which came to power through a Western-backed coup and now has acquired a thin veneer of legitimacy as a result of new elections, will nevertheless go down in history as a criminal government. As will the Obama administration with its Neocon criminal elements -- Victoria Nuland and company -- who actively facilitated the coup from behind the scenes and who now encourage the use of violence to suppress citizens' revolts against the coup government. These people should go to jail...Biden's son is an a board of Ukrainian gas company now..Unbelievable!","Since Putin controls the chessboard, he knows he will eventually get what he wants: greater autonomy for Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians and thereby a buffer against NATO's aggressive encroachment on Russia's borders...Russian-speaking Ukrainians don't trust the hostile Kiev regime--for obvious reasons. It voted to rob them of Russian as an official language (countered by a Presidential veto, but too late) and then it launched a civil war instead of negotiating. The bitterness that will remain after the shooting stops means that it will be long time before a credible national election can be held. Some kind of negotiated autonomy for the region is the more likely outcome--gaining Russia influence over the region so that it will remain a buffer against NATO's relentless encroachment on Russia's borders. Putin will stop there...For things to be different, the US and NATO would need to make the sacrifices implied by military action or absolute sanctions. They won't. Instead, they'll continue their empty and increasingly embarrassing (because hypocritical) shouting about sovereign nations and their stale Cold War rhetoric (who believes that Putin plans to attack the Baltic states and Poland?)...Russians are strongly behind Putin, and the West underestimates them (again) if it thinks a few sanctions will turn them against him. Checkmate in three moves.","East Ukrainian people do not exist for western media and governments. Donbass and Lugansk are daily shelled by heavy Ukrainian government artillery, small childern and civilians are dying daily. Nobody cares. They are only interested if Russia gains anything seeing this as a direct loss for themselves...The majority of mainstream coverage reminds me of the pre-Iraq war drumbeat by the media intended to influence public opinion in support of the war. Remember what happened? After killing of more than half a mil of Iraqi people, mostly civilians, destroying countrys infrastructure, plunging the country into political chaos, the government admitted it was a mistake. Are we preparing to make another one? Who would benefit from it? We are cranking up the defense budget at the expense of more investment in healthcare and education. We are antagonizing one country after another. Doesnt this perpetuate the terrorist threat to our own citizens? Is all this truly in the interest of the American people? Putin deserves criticism for many of his actions, but, as Stephen Cohen put it, Russia has national interests as well. Would US tolerate if Mexico or Canada decided to join RF or Eurasian Union? RussiaUkraine situation is quite similar.","Want another theory?.Ukrainian military tried to eliminate Putin returning from BRIC summit in Brazil (they had almost 30stations capable of hitting high altitude targets in the area)...Malaysian Airlines MH17 plane was travelling almost the same route as Russias President Vladimir Putins jet shortly before the crash that killed 295...Putins plane and the Malaysian Boeing intersected at the same point and the same echelon.

But if we try to respond with force will we have the Greek air force on our side?  Chancellor Merkel, pay attention.  This isn't about economic ideologies.

For want of the tiny cost of helping Greece &amp; Cyprus we could lose NATO.","Although many russians openly disapprove and denounce Putin's rule (myself included), we all agree on this - bringing back Crimea was a right course of action, no matter what Almighty West thinks of it. ..Concerning warmongering intervention..Based on the agreement with Ukraine, Russia is allowed to station up to 25000 troops in Crimea and is allowed to take any precautions to protect it's naval base. Regular military base staff and the special forces units included it's never even crossed 20000. And they never left Crimean peninsula...Geo-politics..If you look on the map of NATO military bases and anti-missile systems , you can see that they almost perfectly encircle russian borders (with exception of few countries, Ukraine included), and the political pressure of viewing Russia as a second-rate country continued for far too long after the cold war. Putin is right to put an end to it. You can't corner a Bear and.not expect him to fight back...As far as global politics goes, Putin managed to execute a very calculated and beneficial move for himself and Russia as a whole. One has to give him credit for that. He managed to secure the nation-wide approval of his actions (which never happened before), strengthen his leadership, exposed the hypocrisy of the West and generally showed himself as a stronger and more confident leader. ..They say the referendum is illegal and the poll results were rigged. Maybe, maybe not. All I know is people cheering on the streets of Crimea.","I can assure you, that Putin will not continue expansion on the rest of Ukraine, otherwise he will lose the overwhelming support of russian people, which he had recently acquired.

He got what he wanted and more.","It is certainly stupid to allow Russia to control any of our domestic uranium production when we only produce 20 of what we ourselves need for our active nuclear power plants. ..Putin's aims are obvious: to have throttle control over Europe's access to energy. Russia already moves much of the region's natural gas and a fair amount of its oil. For France who derives 75 of its domestic electricity from nuclear, Putin's uranium holdings represent grave risk...With that said, this is a great piece of investigative journalism that sadly casts a shadow over a presidential candidate whom I admire.

Its expansion to Russia's borders, at a moment in history when Russia was at its weakest, was certain to be seen as a provocation.  It's very probable that this foolish show of triumphalism actually greased Putin's way to power, and it now provides him with a ready-made excuse to bluster.",Putin doesn't a totally uncooperative Congress to obstruct even his most benign proposals.,"I wholeheartedly agree that the West's expansion of NATO to Russia's border was a provocative mistake that contributed to Putin's rise to power; but I don't agree that he isn't afraid of the expanded NATO.  Russian leaders throughout history felt menaced by any gathering force on her borders...But I don't think that's the full story of  how Putin rose to the top.  Encouraged by Chicago School economists eager to create an Ayn Rand society (how ironic that this former Russian came back to bite), Russia plunged from communism to a laissez-faire cowboy economy, selling off state assets at fire-sale prices; by no accident at all, the newly minted oligarchs were former Communist and KGB characters in Soviet days, and Putin was in the same network.  The network lives on in the new not-so-improved Russia, other than for those members who were purged out because Putin considered them a threat...As an aside, the admiration of Putin among American righties is quite revealing of how they really would like this country to be governed.  Their professed reverence for the constitution masks an ugly authoritarian streak.","So Putin is trying to weaken western alliances.  ..Surprise!  ..There's such a thing as cause and effect.   Instead of being wound-up when the reason for its existence disappeared with the end of the cold war, NATO not only perpetuated itself but expanded despite assurances to the contrary.   Russia has always been nervous of major powers or alliances too close to its border, so any student (even high-school student) of history should have known that the Russians would see this as a provocation, and that it would give rise to the very nationalist reaction that greased Putin's way to power.","I wish I could agree with you that Ukrainians, as individuals and collectively, are challenging Putins values...But I have my doubts.  They may be challenging Putin's muscle but, just as in Syria's civil war, the opposing sides may have values in common.  Some Ukrainian factions are just as nationalistic as their Russian opponents. ..You write dont let anyone tell you that were challenging Russias space.  But we did exactly that with NATO's expansion to Russia's borders which you previously criticized, and quite properly too.","Much as I have ridiculed Mr. Friedman's formulaic essays embracing the economy, universal entrepreneurship and trade, it's the polar opposite of the praise this article deserves.  He was spot on in his opposition to NATO's expansion - it lost its purpose with the end of the USSR and Warsaw Pact, and should have been wound up.   Its continuation was an irritant that may have helped Putin's rise to power, and its expansion to Russia's borders was a needless provocation that surely cultivated his resentment and belligerence.   Besides, if it had not been Putin it would have been someone else like him.  And it made things more difficult for any US President, of either party, to manage any crisis like the present one.  At least, we don't have a President McCain, who would have been all too easily tempted to use the hammer of NATO to deal with the nail of Crimea...President Putin's action in Crimea, reprehensible as it is, is a mirror image of the Monroe Doctrine in action.  Imagine if Mexico and a bunch of other Latin American and Caribbean nations were members of a potentially hostile treaty organization.  ..I also liked the quote from Larry Diamond about the need to reform and repair democracy in the United States.   How can we lecture other nations about democracy when we are busy corrupting our own from within by allowing elections to be bought, politicians to sell themselves to the highest bidder, and voter suppression.","If Russia sees itself as a besieged fortress, the west contributed to this after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the USSR and the Soviet Bloc by its failure to dissolve NATO. ..The reason for its existence had vanished almost overnight.  Instead, NATO recruited more members and expanded eastward, as if it was the most natural thing to do.  It was not, and the leaders of the member nations never even consulted their publics about it.   Maybe it never dawned on them, or maybe it did and they didn't care, that this would be a provocation of Russia.  It must surely have riled nationalist forces in Russia and greased Putin's way to near-absolute power.

Countries like Poland and the Baltic Sates (and the west in general) would have been better off as neutral states, like Finland which a member of the EU but not NATO.  ..The west will do itself and Ukraine a favor if it encourages the Finnish model of internal democracy and external neutrality.  And by the way, IMF-imposed austerity will only destabilize Ukraine further.","I often disagree with Mr. Friedman, and while it doesn't do much good to applaud him after the fact, I'm totally on board with his opposition to expanding NATO.  It was an unnecessary - and dumb, as Mr. Friedman notes - provocation that indeed laid the groundwork for Putin's rise.  I wrote as much in a comment on David Brooks' column yesterday and was vilified in some of the replies.  ..Now there are even voices pushing for an invitation to Ukraine to join NATO.  Frankly, I think NATO's continued existence is destabilizing because its terms of membership require all member nations to support any member that's attacked.  That almost guarantees turning a border dispute into a major conflagration.  ..Whatever settlement may be reached among Crimea, Ukraine and Russia, there's no way NATO could possibly help achieve it or maintain it.   As soon as the dust settles, lets acknowledge its role in the very different world of the Cold War.  And then give it a decent but quick burial."
Andy,,,,"In light of recent and 20th century history the editorial board is entirely justified in calling Putin what he is : a rogue and a despot. Legitimate criticism does not constitute ideology. In the last decade Russia has invaded no less than 3 neighbours, creating identical frozen conflicts.","This is a great example of the kind of quick, focused operation a powerful dictator can get away with in our cosmopolitan, affluent world.  Just look at the comments rationalizing, excusing or even defending Putin's actions.  People are making arguments that are mutually exclusive (Russians were threatened97 voted to join Russia), logically incoherent (the Crimea vote was legit because America is an oligarchy), and sometimes not even relevant (Vietnam was bad, big corporations are really bad).  We bicker and squabble.  Meanwhile the Crimea annexation is done and dusted...What history teaches us, however, is that these operations are often not one-off things.  Our Grenada and Panama incursions gave us the courage to fight Gulf War I, which in turn gave us the courage to throw our military weight around in the Balkans, which gave us the belief that we could do anything in Iraq, which led to catastrophe.  European history is full of delusional autocrats who convinced themselves the only way to protect their nation was by attacking its peaceful neighbors.  The Russians themselves have done this many times, as anyone living near the Baltic or the Black Sea can tell you with lurid detail.  Those events, sooner or later, lead to catastrophe.  ..I'm glad our leaders, at least so far, have acted with considerably more foresight than most of the commenters here would have them do.

PacNWGuy,,,,"The threats of intervention in Ukraine are another in a line of events in recent years (violation of ballistic missile treaty, crackdown on free speech and gayhuman rights, internal election rigging, invasion of Belarus, poisoning of  Yushchenko in Ukraine, etc) which unfortunately seem to indicate that Putin's Russia has come back nearly full circle to the thuggish undemocratic authoritarianism of the Soviet era.","Unfortunately it seems that Mr Putin's credibility is completely shot at this point. His words recently simply do not match the reality on the ground, so I don't see how the US or any other nation can trust anything he has to say at this point. Once one's credibility is shot in this way, you can only really judge them by their actions, and in my opinion Russia's recent build up of troops along Ukraine's eastern border seems to speak for itself about Russia's future intentions.",,,,,,,,
vova,,,,"The only ones who are pushing for solution are Europeans. US just wanna send more weapons to spread more corpses and make things so much worse..I think this strong involvement of US into Ukraina will lead to a nuclear confrontation. Putin already ordered mobilization of reservists across the country. While American residents are busy with super ball and snow storms, the war is getting closer and closer. Plus, bloodthirsty psychopaths like Mccain and Menendez would love to throw us all into demise.",But don't you think that Putin with this project was just trying to protect Europe from gas supply disruption caused by ukraina? And thats why Mccain went to Europe and ordered them to stop this project with Russia.,"I watched Putin's speech today at Z convention. Great facts and presentation of this horrible conflict. I wish western outlets would report all the details but, i believe, its no on the agenda. Putin was right to annex Crimea, cause there would have been thousands of corpses now, had he not done it. And he was also right about accidental border crossing. This happened many times in the past since the border in that region is very porous and soldiers can indeed cross it without realizing where they are. Sad to admit, but, considering recent developments, we are getting closer to a global military conflict. People just won't learn.","Obama is playing with fire. Putin is not stupid. he surrounded himself with a bunch of national extremists. So, if he gets replaced, voluntarily or not, a really extreme guy will take over considering the degree of anti-americanism that Obama generated by his short-sighted sanctions,and then the world will never be the same....Policing the world is a dangerous and very expensive exploit, mr Obama. And you have to be careful what you wish for this Christmas.","This crisis once again demonstrated an outrageously cynical foreign policy that US and Comp. runs. While Russia is sending food and clothes to civilians in Ukraine, US and its bloodthirsty maniacal senators advocate for more weapons to that country as if 3000 civilian corpses is not enough to satisfy their megalomaniac hunger. I tend to agree with Putin that US handles foreign matters like a monkey with a grenade.",,,,,

jstevend,,,,"Putin emphasized that it was imperative today to withdraw all military units from the southeastern regions, stop the violence and immediately launch a broad national dialogue as part of the constitutional reform process involving all regions and political forces,..Both leaders Putin and Merkel reportedly agreed that the 57-nation O.S.C.E. should serve as mediator in the impasse over Ukraine...Mr. Putin has also said that there are no Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, and denies that Moscow is driving the rebellion there...Thursday was May Day, and in Moscow tens of thousands gathered in Red Square to mark the celebration of the working man. News announcers crowed that it was the first time the celebration has been held in the square since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,..The day is still a main event for labor unions and the Communist Party, which was a strident opposition party for many years before lining up behind Mr. Putin and his United Russia Party...This is probably too complicated for Americans other than experts to comment on. It does look like there is a feeling in Russia (and Eastern Ukraine) that could lead to war. The Pro-West Ukrainian leadership appears to be keeping its head and won't provoke anything...The question is, will the presence of Ukrainian military within its own sovereign borders, albeit in the East, provoke Putin to war?..How could anyone this far removed from it all in America have any feeling for what could happen?","Certainly, because of international law, the West has to protest strongly and sanction, etc., etc.--but keep its eye on the ball...Only one thing is materially important here: to keep Russia from moving into Eastern Ukraine; everything else is international politics...To this end, we should not provoke Russia by supplying arms to Ukraine. Obama should at once concentrate efforts to prevent any of our allies from doing so. That would be dangerous...Crimea is a highly charged emotional issue with Russia, and Putin reflects a country in crisis. Even if it is mostly a personal crisis with Putin and his slim hold on power, we have to remember history and how other actors have behaved in similar political conditions. Think of Hitler and Napoleon.","We are dealing with a nuclear power. That demands cautious calculation of who's power. So look at it as a whole. Crimea has Russia's only warm-water ports and a mostly Russian-speaking population. Of course, Putin violated international law and the U.S and Europe are trying to make him pay with the sanctions, and the drop in the price of oil was punishing too. ..Again, Eastern Ukraine is mostly Russian speaking, and Russians now look on Krushev's giving of Crimea in 1954 to Ukraine as having been a mistake. Though no one in the world at the time could have anticipated the break-up the USSR in the 90s and the independence of Ukraine...So, there is a whole lot going on psychologically. The situation is already rife with high emotion. And there are those nukes...In a way, albeit remotely, it's like Iraq in 2003. Sure they were targeting U.S. planes on their 'no fly zone' patrolling, but Iraq was essentially an occupied country. The inspectors could go anywhere and inspect anything. The Iraqis would balk but then relent. So it was stable to a certain degree...Now we have Russia and the sanctions. Arming Ukraine significantly in a way that is clear to Russian sight is not a good idea. The situation in East Ukraine is tense and violent and there are reportedly out-of-uniform Russian troops and tanks there. ..In a situation so intense, it's too easy to error and start a full-scale war. It is probably at about the most war-like level that it can be without all-out war.","...the latest in a string of successes for what the West has said is Russias covert strategy to destabilize Ukraine and discredit the interim government ahead of presidential elections scheduled for next month...This aspect would see Putin and pro-Russian Ukrainians hoping this 'takeover' strategy influences the elections away from pro-West Ukrainian leadership, at least according to Mr. ROTH and presumably his sources. ..Doesn't make sense, does it? It will harden pro-West Ukrainian resolve, not weaken it. That is only human nature...There is always the chance for missteps that go tragically bad, but the current Ukrainian leadership (of the country as a whole), will likely bide their time and let Western sanctions play out. As long as no one is getting killed or wounded, any other kind of suffering of the Ukrainian people because of these pro-Russian takeovers will probably have to be tolerated. Medical emergencies will no doubt be honored with co-operation, East and West...So hang loose everyone; it looks like I have everything conceptually under control. I'll let you know if I need to tweak the concepts at all in future comments. You're in good hands with old Steve here. Don't worry about a thing.","The tone of all this is peaceful settlement. It could lead to something very creative like an international commission to provide oversight of some kind under U.N, auspices. This requires understanding all around. Putin does not want isolation. He's clearly smarting from Western actions and wants back into the community that appeared to be slipping away from Russia. Kerry and Obama and no doubt the others are smart enough to maneuver this satisfactorily to an acceptable ending for all concerned. This is my bet.","This is a powerful, informative essay, and fortunately, optimistic. Is it too optimistic? Putin's anger is pointed out here. But what about paranoia? Has he reached a point where he cannot bring himself to accept the loss of his power in Russia sometime in the future? Then he becomes maybe a very dangerous man.","It's a very difficult situation in Ukraine and not at all clear what to do, apparently. Arm the Ukrainians? Apparently not for some reason. Putin is a bit of a dicey character, not all that 'real,' meaning he's a dangerous character, to himself and the world. Probably best is accept Russian help if it does indeed lead to rapprochement with Iran along the lines you mention. That done, then deal with Ukraine (assuming nothing drastic will have happened.) Given the nature of the situation, It is probably not in anyone's best interest to try to arm Ukraine unreasonably. To what end? It's likely to do nothing bur raise tensions. No one needs that. The world will probably be lucky if Eastern Ukraine does not break off completely. If that were the solution to keeping Putin from doing something really foolish, I really could not say. You don't want to encourage him either, like Hitler. It's a tough, tough mess. It surely is best if whatever happens does not lead to war.","You need to listen to Pacifica Radio's guests on Ian Master's 'Background Briefing.' Then you might realize how stupid your questions and statements are. Putin is in trouble in his own country and under extreme pressure like despots in history before him to distract and make a big show for a people whose lives he is utterly incompetent to make better. Hitler comes to mind. Plus, he is possessed of delusions of regaining the lost power of an empire, and, what the world should truly fear, some sense of glory. Napoleon Bonaparte comes to mind. ..Look at recent pictures of him in public after meetings: at the U.N. and outside the Russian legislature. He is deeply troubled. One expert stated that Putin has no choice in his own mind but to do everything he can to remain in power. His crimes against the Russian people are of such a nature and magnitude that his only safety anywhere in the world is in Russia and in power. He is therefore, a very dangerous man who possesses nuclear weapons...This needs to be entered into any calculations of how to deal with him.  ..He is not at all a stupid man. He is a bad man.","The West is going to feel the need to do this on two levels: One is for Western countries' domestic politics; the other is in respect to international law. ..Their actions are no doubt coordinated, but only one thing is important. That is wisdom. Political miscalculations through arrogance and outright folly have started horrendous conflicts. It's arguable that World War One could have been avoided. Opinion in the Union is said to have been that the American Civil War would be over in a matter of a few weeks. It has been argued that Hitler could have been stopped early on with better insight into the danger...Russia under Putin is belligerent and aggressive. This is the second time in recent history that he has taken a chunk out of a country in an area with large Russian populations...This is the Hitler mind set. His actions are eerily similar, and likely for the same reason as Hitler's: insecure hold on power. All tyrants in history have done this: garner support among the people for an external conflict. This is easily seen in the cases of Hitler and Napoleon. Napoleon said, My power derives from my glory and my glory derives from my victories...Putin is an unstable character. He is like Assad, Hitler and Napoleon: paranoid and incapable of imagining a life without power...So, what is needed is the wisdom derived from a careful understanding of this man in order to know how to 'handle' him...The West could easily miscalculate and see Russia in East Ukraine.","To the West: posturing; that's all it is. To the East: Russia (or mostly Putin) was angry about revolution in Ukraine and the West's response condoning it...It brought to the surface all kinds of psychological stuff not the least of which is Putin's peculiarities. He's in a class of weak characters who got power, are paranoid and can't imagine themselves without power: Putin, Assad, Hitler, Napoleon (Stalin was something else though--not sure--a shrewd and savage man but different than the others.)  ..This reflects a crisis in Russia, or mostly Putin's slim hold on power. It all got funneled into this Ukrainian revolution ...So yes, the West applies sanctions, etc, but realize that there has been no violence. Crimea is no big deal except to Russian and the Ukraine. It means nothing to us except for our principles of fairness and justice, etc...Well, we can swallow that while we keep making noise. Our only big concerns are that this thing doesn't go hot andor Russia moves on East Ukraine...To that end, don't add fuel (arm Ukraine) to a fire that has not yet started and most probably won't start if everyone keeps their heads..Putin is still on a slow boil. Let him cool off."
Jonathan,,,,"Putin has dealt a double blow to nuclear arms control: not only has he continuously raised the spectre of Russia using nuclear weapons, but he has flouted the agreement over Ukraine in 1994 to give up their nuclear weapons for territorial assurances by the US and Russia. Putin has sent a terrible message to the rest of the world: that it is not safe to give up your nuclear weapons..Also, if Russia is going to grab Crimea, which historically belonged to Russia, then they need to cede Kaliningrad back to Poland and Lithania. Kaliningrad has never historically been Russian; currently it is a festering sore in the heart of Eastern Europe and is further being armed to the teeth.","So what to do about it Mr. Cohen?  Your two points, bolstering NATO locally and continuing sanctions, are being done already. The thought of the USA sending military weapons to Eastern Europe to help combat Russia seems rather unrealistic and insane. And if that were to be done, shouldn't Poland or another Ukrainian neighbor or at least a European power take the lead?  The US cannot afford the cost and blowback of such interventions anymore; we are overextended both financially and politically. Sending weapons to Ukraine would not only play right into Putin's rhetoric of the US as Empire, but ultimately would be a colossal military failure. We are just no match sitting on the other side of the world against one of the largest ground forces in the world..No, other than the two aforementioned strategies we need to sit tight and get our own house in order. Being the beacon of political and social justice that we should be and which we are failing at- would do far more to counter Putin than any costly and barbaric military adventure.","ted from Portland, I have no doubt that you are one of the Russian propagandists which the Kremlin is employing to make Putin's case. Poroshenko was elected by those who voted in the Ukrainian elections not a hand-picked puppet.  The demonstrations that preceded it in the Maiden were filled with many citizens of Ukraine, some unsavory but this notion the U.S. or Israel was behind this is nonsensical and not supported by the evidence.

Don F,,,,"I think Obama has been trying to change the U.S. role of supporting dictators for the enrichment of US corporations and energy for the US.  Putin is all too happy to fill this role. Unfortunately, it makes Obama appear weak to those who believe force equals strength (which sometimes it does).","War weary Americans elected and re-elected a president who promised to withdraw the U.S. from 2 wars and who also promised not pull the trigger on another war unless absolutely necessary.  True to his word, President Obama has done mostly as promised.  ..The Middle East is extremely complex and dangerous. Political solutions are elusive, if even possible at all. The U.S. role without a sincere military threat of boots on the ground is weak and rightly perceived as a president and citizenship with no appetite for war. As a result, our ability to effectively intervene is crippled.  Moreover, in Syria Assad or ISIL is going to win, neither option of which is tolerable to Obama and leading to a deer-in-the-headlights position for our president who has been unsuccessful in crafting an option...Russia is filling this power vacuum. Russia has the advantage of being more than happy to see Assad stay in power.  Putin can do what Obama cannot, support the butcher Assad in the cause to defeat the butchers of ISIL. Without committing a full military operation, there appears is no viable option other than to support the murderous Assad or allow ISIL to continue to rape and murder and expand a 21st century version of the Dark Ages in the Middle East.  ..Putin's efforts to establish a more powerful Russian presence in the Middle East may result in the defeat of ISIL, making Russia a hero of sorts. If this happens, we will owe Putin much gratitude and his image and influence will soar.",The Russian people seem not too different than the American people - fearful.  Americans supported Bush's Middle East invasion and are happy to give up their liberties (e.g. Domestic survellince) in trade for perceived security.  As a frind once observe: People are tiny.  Nothing makes people act tiny more than fear. And Putin is a superb fear monger.,"Of course you are correct about the invasion of Iraq. However, this does nit make Putin any better than Bush and crew.  Remember, W looked into Putin's eyes and saw his soul.

Until the U.S. government acknowledges that we tortured people and then takes effecrive steps to prevent a repeat, we have little moral high ground to claim regarding Putin and other thugs.","If the situation was turned around the US would do nearly  the same thing as Russia, e.g. Guatemala 1954, Contras, etc.  Obama (who I voted for twice) should have kept his communications with Putin private and tried to cut a deal (you get Crimea and leave rest if Ukraine alone) or just left the situation alone.  Trying to play world cop in a situation that you will not commit force to is futile.",,,,
Mary,,,,I only hope Europe has the strength of principles with the knowledge of history to reject anything Putin offers or implies.  Europe and the free world must not be swayed be putin's propaganda.,"Obama's problem when it comes to negotiating is his past and ideals.  He honestly believes the US is bad, he was fed that by his mentor as a young man and it was re-instilled by Rev. Wright and others that he listens to.  Obama also believes that if the US pulled back from its evil engagements, at home (police, racism, poor vs. rich rhetoric) and over seas (yes the middle east bombed us, but that's because we bought their oil), that the rest of the world would be at peace...This is nave at best and demonstrates that he is a bad leader.  Not just when it comes to foreign affairs, but domestic as well.  He thought he could just mandate and all would fall in place.  But he's really a 20 year old mind stuck in the immature notions of the world that comes from no experience, just books and lectures by his mentor (communist) and professors (ivory tower elitists that have never worked in the real world).  ..There is a place for ideals and professors and lectures and discussions.  But it's not at the level of President of the United States.  Putin sees this and is having a field day.  The UN is pretty much the same, but has the nationalistic bent where representatives care only about what they get for their own countries, or themselves instead of their constituents.  ..A community organizer for Chicago that never really was able to organize that small area of the globe.

Wasn't it Obama that winked at the negotiators and told them to wait until he was re-elected and then he would do Russia's bidding?  Hasn't he been doing Putin's bidding all along?  I believe Obama is disappointed that Putin and he don't get together as friends for all the world to see, but then Putin has no desire to meet with Obama or do anything for humanity or the globe.  He's focused on a new communist Russia, and perhaps a re-establishment of the USSR.  ..But seriously, you are blaming Bush?!",We prayed for the Ukrainians and had a Ukrainian Nun speak at the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine in Washington DC yesterday.

Russian and Putin are stepping in to take the lead role. The situation is going from bad to worse.,"While I understand that none of us on this planet, well, most, want war or violence.  However, it seems nave at best to go the diplomacy route.  I don't believe that ISIS or Assad are about diplomacy.  For that matter, I don't believe the middle east is about diplomacy.  It's a group of countries that, frankly, don't really like each other too well.  ..Obama wants Assad out.  What gives him that right?  Putin is supporting Assad, but only because they are 'friendly' when it comes to oil transport.  However, at least Putin is acting.

Really? That's the people we support. They use ambulances to conduct recognizance. It goes inline with killing civilians in the rebel cities. Putin is a bad guy, but Kiev is ran by war criminals. So when the ambulance without Ukrainian soldiers gets shot down, who will be responsible for it? The rebels, who know Kiev uses ambulances to gather intelligence or the rebels, who know what ambulances are doing on the roads? This is an outright violation of Geneva accord about using red cross for military purposes, that accidentally made it into the news. And by the way, even Ukrainian law prohibits using ambulance for anything other than transporting patients.

Probably no, because Kiev fights for a good cause.","It's apparent that rebels were facilitated by  Russia in this attack, if not by providing them all the needed equipment (some of which could have been stolencaptured from the Ukraine military) than by providing them the experts and expertise to use it. ..However in it's effort to play this as covertly as possible, Putin didn't dispatch the proper number and type of experts. Rebels may have had Russian military specialists with enough knowledge to aim and launch this sophisticated equipment but not to ensure it's a correct target.","If West will not give Ukraine military support (especially military intelligence) , on May 9th 2015, if not much sooner, Putin will enter Kharkiv or even Kiev as a concuring Tsar.","Instead of a full scale invasion,  Putin decided to simmer the conflict with many small,  covert invasions.

Eugene,,,,"In my view, the lost 5000 lives in Ukraine could have been avoided if the West had reacted on time when it all started almost a year ago.

Maybe you find there thousands peaceful people that have been killed in Iraq, Afghanitan, Lybia, Sirya, Kosovo...","5'7, which is Putin's height, is not extremely short. He's short but not much shorter than the average American guy in LA, for example.",,,,,,

Mike,,,,"I am willing to consider that it is entirely possible that when the USSR was dismembered and Ukraine was designated an independent state that the borders were hastily and imperfectly drawn and that ethnic Russian areas which were included in Ukraine should have been included in Russia and that what's going on now is an attempt to restore the natural order...Putin is not always wrong. Remember that in 2013 Obama was on the verge of going into Syria to displace Assad over his use of chemical weapons, (against rebels who we now know to be ISIS)? Putin stepped in and persuaded Syria to divest itself of those weapons voluntarily and put them under international control thereby resolving the crises peacefully and without firing a shot. There was even talk of Putin getting a Nobel, absurd as that may seem...<a hrefhttp:www.cnn.com20130912politicssyria-putin-analysis titlehttp:www.cnn.com20130912politicssyria-putin-analysis targetblank>http:www.cnn.com20130912politicssyria-putin-analysis<a>","The US has strategically warmed relations with both Cuba and Iran to remove them as options for Russia to stir-up trouble in retaliation for economic sanctions.  So now Putin is on why-can't-we-be-friends world-tour that has included N. Korea and Cyprus.  ..On a positive note, Fox News has stopped heralding Putin as a great world leader.","Once again, the presupposition of this article is that America is obliged to be the world's policeman. Whether it is the fragmented sectarian, tribal and ethnic wars in the Middle East or Putin's aggression in the Ukraine or Boko Haran's savagery in Nigeria, the eyes of the world turn to the United States and all are ready to hold our coat as they encourage us to step into the ring and fight their wars at our expense...Whether it is  neo con hubris or a need to justify military spending that equals that of the combined expenditures of the next 15 or so countries or the desire to simply criticize President Obama on every front, the hawks in the United States are more than willing to hand our coat to whomever asks and jump into the melee...Fortunately, people from across the political specturm are beginning to ask two imporatnt questions: What are the interests of the United States? And, what are the other countries in the affected regions doing to help themselves? Anwsers to the first are murky at best and to the second question very clear: not nearly enough.","The United States doesn't have much influence on this matter unless Germany is on board...The planing for the Iraq invasion ought to have ended the moment Turkey refused to allow American troops to invade from the North. Instead, George W. Bush blundered forward with his catastrophic war that destabilized the region and strengthened Iran...As for Germany, it makes me happy to read that mention of force is near anathema to the vast majority of the German people. The people of Germany witnessed the folly of modern war twice in the twentieth century and since that time have created an advanced economy that's no longer focused on conquest and empire. Germany is also way ahead of the United States in the production of sustainable energy...The United States and Russia still hold onto this illusion that military force solves more problems than it creates. Not surprisingly, they're also the world's two biggest weapons dealers. And of course coal and oil still lies at the heart of everything. Imagine a coin with Putin's face on one side and the Koch Brother's faces on the other....a refinery, an oil well, and a tank etched behind each of their shoulders...But what do I, as an ordinary American, have to gain by sending my children to fight in another war in Europe or the Middle East?..What was the lesson we learned in Vietnam? What was the lesson we learned in Iraq? Those are the first two questions I'd like every candidate for President to answer.",I have to agree with Putin on this one.  A rag tag rebel force is not going to be able to stand up to ISIS.  If we are going to support the rebels then we need to really support them with military actions and not just rhetoric.  By using our rhetoric we have weekend Assad but we have not taken his regime out of the picture so we have contributed to the destabilization of the region allowing ISIS to gain a stronger hold on the territory..Russian aggression in the Ukraine is not a good thing but in the case of the Middle East it would be best if we could work together with the Russians to thwart this menace called ISIS.,"Good article. It's apparent that without adequate feedback inside Russia that the population accepts Putin because of fear. But as history has shown, you can't fool all of the people all of the time. Eventually, enough good Russians (and there are many many good Russians) will re-awake and dump Putin (either literally or symbolically). If Putin's paranoia were so persuasive, he would pull in more believers. What does he offer the world? Progress, technology, medical breakthroughs, assistance? No, he offers only fear and bullying. Who would select that ideology except people with an inferiority complex?","Putin is nothing more than a KGB thug who is looking out for his own best interests - .  He could care a less what happens to the citizens of his or any neighboring country, so long as he diverts attention away from the pillaging and plundering that he and his oligarch cronies are undertaking.  More and stronger sanctions are needed!!!..Here is an idea Mr. President (Obama), why not start placing a federal property tax on all the U.S. property that these oligarchs have acquired in the last 10 years or so with all the money they plundered from their country.","It's probably time for the West to let this go...I'm not so sure that Putin is 100 wrong, though he was a tad heavy-handed and inelegant in how he brought this about...It appears that when the Soviet Union was dismembered into independent republics, Crimea, which is mostly ethnically Russian, probably should have been tacked onto Russia instead of arbitrarily annexed to Ukraine. The way Putin probably sees it he's correcting that mistake, restoring the natural order. It seems not to be like in 1938 when you-know-who, around the time when he hosted a big Olympics, grabbed up parts of neighboring Czechoslovakia and the French and Brits were strong-armed into looking the other way. In this case the Crimean people seem to have no big problem with this. Self-determination doesn't apply to them to the Crimean people? ..Not to mention Ukraine's Morsi-like deposing of Yanukovych, a legitimately elected president seems, to be a miscarriage of justice in a place that professes to be a democracy. In a democracy when you're dissatisfied with your elected leaders you impeach them or, you wait it out until the next election when you vote for the other guy. What's the argument in favor of the violent overthrow of a legitimately elected president?","The Russian war against ISIS will be very different from their experience in Afghanistan.  Their military learned valuable lessons from that conflict just as we did from Vietnam.  Additionally, based on Putin's actions in Crimea, he is willing to use his own soldiers or proxies to accomplish his goals without worrying about public opinion.  At the end of the day, Putin will win in Syria, Assad will stay in power, and Russian influence in the region will replace America's","Their efforts already are in vain. What do you mean, will Putin observe the ceasefire? Clearly he has not. There is no ceasefire, just a continued offensive by RUSSIA (let's start calling these rebels what they are."

Seems there's nothing that folks of McCain's ilk won't stoop tobut hire an Ex-VietNam VetPrisoner who was given way better treatment than the rest of the prisoners, because of his father's military and political status. The sound bites and visuals are lovely.","Not unseemly at all, since he is absolutely spot on the truth. And unfortunately, Obama has fallen into the neo-con trap of restarting the Cold War - solely to bolster the Petro-dollar hegemony that is used to trade nat-gas and oil around the world. The real threat from Putin is his partnering with China, India and quite a few of the ASEAN bloc countries to switch from the dollar to rubleYuangold and other currencies to trade in resources - completely cutting the dollar out of the transactions. John Kerry went to Saudi Arabia to make a secret deal to drop the price of oil as low as possible - not realizing the consequences of this action, that was designed to break the Russian bank and oil industry and thus force Putin out. Putin did a deal with China to build the largest pipeline project in the world thereby bypassing Russia's need to supply the South Stream pipeline. The US was pressuring ex-soviet bloc countries and bribing them to drop the South Stream dealthere's more, but to rant now WOULD be unseemly.","It's another all Putin, all the time day at the New York Times. Yesterday it was arresting his critics. Today it's the failure of Putin and how he lost the South Stream pipeline. Tomorrow, no doubt, it will be more of the same. Notice how they start the opinion piece: Putin annexes Crimea. Forgetting that Russia maintains their naval fleet there - and has for decades. Followed up by Putin's attempts to undermine European Unity. Conveniently omitting the fact that the USEU and GB are continuing to undermine Russian unity with it's traditional trading partners and ex-soviet satellite states. Think Ukraine. Then Putin flaunts EU rules and regulations. Despite Putin's conciliatory attempts to find common ground - attempts that were rejected by the USEUGB, who then blamed Putin for being intractable. Need we go on?.This is more dissembling and wag-the-dog media coverage to distract the gullible from looking a bit further down the New York Times front page. Where - astoundingly - Obama is CONTINUING to push for the TPP 12 country deal that effectively will give Global Corporatists more rights than the sovereign countries involved..Corporations will be able to over-rule all environmental, legal, trade, financial, infrastructure, political, and social programs in countries that sign away their sovereign rights - and, will be able to inflict fees and penalties on those countries that try to maintain some semblance of self-governance..And NY Times readers think Putin is bad?","the Kremlins viewthat toppling authoritarian governments in the Middle East has led only to chaos and sanctuaries for terrorists - is spot on. Especially if those terrorists are acting as our proxies in the Grand Chessboard Game - a game that unfortunately has cost trillions of dollars and killed or displaced millions of people. Now that China has brought military support to assist Russia and the Syrian government; now that the US has to treat China with kid gloves; now that Putin refuses to let the US-trained and funded ISISISIL moderate terrorists run amok without being targeted; now that the US stands to be isolated in the ME by refusing to target ISISISIL - instead of Assad's forces - the Oops Theory of Military Practice (OTMP), you are seeing the diplomatic process being taken..Diplomacy, however, is not the strong suit of the US, who prefers to have nations bow down in obeisance. Those who do not - Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan - for instance, are greeted with bombs - not roses. And coming full circle, where ever there is regime change and the deposition of authoritarian (read dictators) leaders, the void left behind gets quickly filled by chaos and terrorists..Therein lies the conundrum: we excoriate terrorists and pledge their elimination, yet we assist certain terrorists if we feel they will do our bidding or are in our national interest. We want our cake and to eat it without sharing. The sooner we realize that greed has blow-back, the better.","If Putin was smart, he'd let the Ukraine fend for itself. Once the breadbasket of the USSR, now, thanks to the Fukishima-like blowout at Chernobyl in 1986, the Ukraine is now contaminated and continues to be contaminated by radiation from the meltdown - which after all these years is still uncontained. ..Children born in downwind Ukraine and Belarus still suffer a massive toll of mutation and illness, as confirmed by a wide range of governmental, scientific and humanitarian organizations. Key low-ball Chernobyl death estimates come from the World Health Organization, whose numbers are overseen by International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations organization chartered to promote the nuclear industry. After 28 years, the reactor industry has still not succeeded in installing a final sarcophagus over the exploded Chernobyl Unit 4, though billions of dollars have been invested. -  courtesy of Harvey Wasserman at Commondreams.org..Thinking long-term, it doesn't matter who runs the country, since the radiation-related health data complied by three Russian scientists in more than 5,000 studies, have concluded that Chernobyl has already killed nearly a million people worldwide..Chernobyl has created a dead zone that surrounds the Ukraine and affects everyone who lives there - regardless of which political party rules the roost.

And what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before. ..The West is using this incident as a further opportunity to destabilize Putin, create further chaos within Ukraine (beyond the chaos they already created by arming and funding the Neo-fascist uprising), and to prevent Gazprom profiting from the transiting of oil and gas to Europe. The other larger regional issues would fill a small novel, but suffice to say, the US and the EU are using this to further isolate Russia from the West and to show other nations (China, primarily) what the West will do when their financial and geo-political interests are threatened...Fact: As the Council on Foreign Relations notes (and they ought to know): All three regional actors - Russia, pro-Russian rebels of the Donetsk Peoples Republic, and the Ukrainian government - had access or potential access to this weapons platform...Former AP and Newsweek reporter Robert Parry explains: Ukraine, after all, was part of the Soviet Union until 1991 and has continued to use mostly Russian military equipment...For a link from the Ukraine military bragging about their the BUK system: <a hrefhttp:en.uos.uaproduktsiyatehnika-pvo75-zenitniy-raketniy-kompleks-buk titlehttp:en.uos.uaproduktsiyatehnika-pvo75-zenitniy-raketniy-kompleks-buk targetblank>http:en.uos.uaproduktsiyatehnika-pvo75-zenitniy-raketniy-kompleks-buk<a>..Will the truth prevail?

AFP (Agence France-Presse) reports, judging by side-markings it was an MQ-5B drone - which is likely part of the Bavarian-based 66th US Recon Brigade, that was recently relocated to the Ukrainian Kirovohrad, from where drones commit reconnaissance raids in the direction of Crimea and Russian border areas...Of course, the irony shouldn't be lost on anyone - while the US complains about violations of sovereignity and the Russian presence in Ukraine, it feels no compunction or reservation about violating said sovereignity by drone espionage. ..Kerry will, as they say, have some 'splaining to do.

Mel,,,,It takes  historical ignorance to think we have a say as to what happens in Crimea. It was part of Russia for hundreds of years. Putin is merely returning things to the way they were and there is nothing we can do about it . Nothing. We aren't the worlds police but we are the worlds whiners. If we allowed our president to be a man he would have simply mimicked the movie line  Sanctions ? We don't need no sanctions .....,"This isn't a Municb moment. It's simple negotiations. If you threaten Ukraine we'll give you Crimea..Our answer should be - it's a deal. If we want Putin to police that region against Islamic fundamentalism, this is a small price. Ukraine has no ties to Crimea. It belongs to the Tatars's if anybody.","Matty, Putin is also a strong leader!","Huh? I watched the Putin talk last night on Russian news. I showed authentic leadership. It was open, unscripted, real and honest with emotion. Obama was talking points, no depth, no leadership. The American reaction is silly as usual. I am sure we would love a base in the Ukraine. Could this be the reason for the 1B loan?  Why can we quickly give loans in areas which don't concern us but not to our own people for housing, education, healthcare etc. So embarrassing these days to be an American. If we spent the same energy on real issues there would no guns in this country. Amazing how stupid we are.",,,,,,
Edward Sevume,,,,".Europe and America have been outflanked and outsmarted. Mr Putin has done his homework well...He knows that in order to talk in international affairs you need power. He saw the worsening situation of the army and he swiftly decided to change that. ..On Europe - he saw how Europe needed energy independence from the Middle East and decided to ensure through the construction of the North Stream which in effect would make Europe dependent on Russia. Europe cannot do without Russia..He also allowed implicitly the migration of Russians wanting to live abroad. These are very rich ladies and gentlemen on which the economies of Britain, France and to a certain extent Germany cannot do without. ..As regards America, Russia made sure that the transport routes to Afghanistan are in its the control, as such, America is bound to shout but not that loud as it could lead to the revocation of the agreements surrounding these lifelines of those NATO..Iran is another thorn in the back - Russia has played its part and had it not been for some blinking, the Iranians would never have moved. Now with this debacle in Ukraine, that agreement of limited sanctions to make Iran comply is in danger..Syria is also a country that has well cemented relations with Russia.  President Putin has kept his word as regards Assad. He does not leave friends he has agreements in dire straits with and thanks to this one, Assad is still in power.","McCain has been a propagandist for war. He has supported wars waged by the USA against Iraq, Afghanistan and given approval to the little Caucasian Republic of Georgia in its war against Assetia. This gentleman has shown how reckless he is ready to go in order to get America involved in foreign wars. On rare occasions does one agree with Mr Putin but I think he must have been right on this one - McCain has never recovered from the brunts of war considering his participation in Vietnam. McCains propositions on settling conflicts, have had war as main ingredient. The senator sees conflict resolution through the prism of war to the detriment of diplomacy. Americans made a great choice by skipping McCain for imagine if he were president! The idea of being a military power does not mean you use it every time you are faced with a crisis. The reverse of what I am saying is what has landed America in huge problems - trying to solve problems around the world militarily. Thats how the Soviets got bogged down in Afghanistan and by the way they lost that war.  As Churchill was said, the past is prologue. Wars can solve problems in the short run. But the issues still persist and it is upon governments to get their best diplomats to get down to work. Talking to each other can solve many things - at least until or options have been emptied. The honorable senator is better positioned to know this.",,,,,,,,
Len,,,,Any agreement signed by Putin iis not even worth the paper it is printed on. If Angela has not figured this out by now she should turn in her frequent flyer card.,"Yo Moscow, the U.S. has had a very consistent policy for nearly 100 years with regard to Europe -to prevent the emergence of a hegemon in Europe; why we went to war there against Germany, twice -you people in the Kremlin know this so please give us a break and stop filling up the comments page with your insipid propagandist drivel. If you want to write anything at all be honest and state that a pro-western Ukraine being 400 kilometers from Moscow with none the geographic impediments between  represents, in Moscow's eyes, an existential threat to Russia and having lost Ukraine, twice, Putin is desperate to get it back and failing that as it is hardly likely at this point (Maiden was a gross intelligence failure on Moscow's part and heads did roll) at the minimum maintain a frozen conflict in Ukraine and secure a land bridge to Crimea as without one Crimea is essentially indefensible. Hello? You paying attention?","Agree, Moscow's takeover of Crimea does not appear to have been  executed on the fly, a piece of long standing in Moscow's overall defensive strategy. Likely developed in response to the Orange and Rose revolutions of '04 and '05. I doubt that the former KGB Colonel has abandon his Cold War geopolitical mentality concerning the West; he believes the strategic objective of the U.S. is to encircle Russia, and would see any actions contrary to Russian interests and security in the European borderlands as being orchestrated by Washington. If he thought that Washington would not be so bold or arrogant as to walk into Russia's backyard the color revolutions would have disabused him of that thinking. The Ukrainian border is less than 400 miles from Moscow with none the mountains or major rivers in between thus a western aligned Ukraine is an existential threat to Russia and cannot be allowed to happen as it would render Russia indefensible. I would further argue that it is entirely possible that Moscow had a hand in the events in Maidan Square spiraling out of control forcing Yanukovych to flee the capital. Yanukovych's dance with Europe indicated him to be unreliable, that he was so spectacularly corrupt, even by Russian standards, he would sell to the highest bidder. That there were Russian undercover operatives imbedded in the far right which blew up every negotiated settlement. Putin's specialty in the KGB was double games -it is said in Russia once KGB, always KGB.","Another one of our President's now famous red lines? Or is he just expressing an opinion? Either way Putin will ignore him. Two things to keep in mind here, first and foremost a WesternNATO oriented Ukraine is an existential threat to Russia as it would render Russia indefensible -thus that will not happen. Second is the Medved Doctrine: Russia reserves the right to defend and protect Russians anywhere in the world -there are a lot of Russians in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Our President would do well to keep his mouth shut here as there is nothing he can do if Moscow feels sufficiently threatened to take action (and they will not take action unless the perceive a threat). The orientation of Ukraine, whether towards Europe or Russia is not vital to U.S. interests however, it is critical to Russian interests.","It is also time to hold Mr. Obama to his words.  The outrage of this tragedy speaks clearly as to Mr. Putin's increasingly irresponsible and renegade actions.  The tidal wave of upheaval in the Middle East, and the resultant growing and horrifying carnage threatens to eventually engulf the world..Here at home, tens of thousands of people from other countries just cross our border as if responding to an open invitation.  Now we learn that some are from countries that harbor and export terrorism.  We also now know that Mr. Obama knew about this growing internal crisis almost a year ago.  And all the while, with all these foreign and domestic fractures,  Mr. Obama casually plays golf and blithely goes about fund raising.  The problem here, the root of the problem, is that he is a dishonest man.  When a leader of a country lies to his people, he becomes as a diminished person, and that country suffers.  He has in the past repeated and deliberately lied to the American people.  The lies we know of are associated with his signature achievement, Obamacare, as well as how the IRS had been used to blunt real opposition to his re-election.  The lies are associated with the murder of our ambassador, Mr. Stevens, and three others serving our country.  Dishonesty is like cancer.  But in this case it erodes internally the ability to act honestly and effectively.  Our country is in deep and serious trouble, as is the world.  Our president needs to be held accountable to his words.",,,,,

His regime may appear imposing, but it is rotting inside. His Russia is not a great power on par with America. It is a gas station run by a corrupt, autocratic regime.

Gerhard Miksche,,,,How are independent political analysts defined? Can anybody tell?..I think that Senator Robert Menendez has a point. A rare exception within that illustrous body. Putin may pull the plug earlier than expected. Or the pressure building up behing the plug will make it burst.,"Jim, here it comes. ..<a hrefhttp:www.forbes.comsitesmarkadomanis20130204five-myths-about-russia titlehttp:www.forbes.comsitesmarkadomanis20130204five-myths-about-russia targetblank>http:www.forbes.comsitesmarkadomanis20130204five-myths-about-rus...<a>..To my best knowledge, Forbes are not suspected to be Putin's agents. But this may change. Quite a number of comments on this site are in the McCarthy tradition. On the other hand, quite a number of comments on Swedish sites are in the Carl Bildt tradition. Mr. Bildt is our foreign minister.","Sandy, in my view your analysis is to the point. I think that this unfortunate development could be stopped even now though it is very late. It would need real courage from the United States and some major European power to sit down with Mr. Putin for a second, positive Yalta. Without giving in on democracy and human rights. I think that the mere fact of treating Mr. Putin and Russia as equal players on the international scene would be beneficial. But we don't have the leaders we would need right now.",,,,,,,
Dave,,,,"Time is on Mr. Putin's side.  As long as Western Europe needs natural gas in the winter and their economies depend on Russia as a trading partner, these sanctions are temporary.  In time, Ukrainians will tire of war and economic misery by changing governments who will be more accepting of Russian influence with the West soon following suit..Putin knows that Western Europe needs Russia as an active trading partner for their own economic security and as soon the Ukraine cries uncle, so will the West.","I realize that it's almost never a good idea to draw any comparisons to Hitler, and I'm not saying that Putin is the next Hitler. But between this and Georgia and his self-appointed role as protector of Russian speakers, I can't help thinking of the Anschluss and the Sudetenland. History doesn't repeat itself (Santayana's statement is widely misunderstood), but it's hard to ignore the parallels. Better to take a firm stand now than later.","And once more, the flood of Russian intelligence-backed bloggers and bots flooding comments sections with talk about neo-nazis, how much Ukrainians hate Kiev, and the glory of Putin's totally-not-corrupt-and-autocratic Russia!..Never mind that fewer than 15 of eastern Ukrainians want Russia to have any greater control over them, or that the majority of youth both east and west would rather join the EU than Putin's trade scheme, or that Russian nationalism is rife with neo-Nazis and anti-semites that would make Ukrainian nationalists blush (there's a reason so many Russian Jews fled when immigration opened up in the 80's - and not because their countrymen were too nice to them). ..The Ukrainian people deserve the right to determine their own future, without armed mobs, Russian threats, or western bribes. The reactionary Russian-leaning right (not to be confused with the reactionary Ukrainian nationalist right - guess what! There can be TWO bad sides in a multi-sided struggle!) is clearly trying to win by force and pressure what they fear they couldn't win in a fair election without their Man in Kiev.","Ah, yes, I'm sure that if the Putin sympathizers thought they'd win a national referendum, they'd be more than willing to let the west go its own way in oblast-by-oblast elections run without any central authority by armed mobs backed by unmarked NATO units. ..Also, Dan - I'm well aware there are a wide range of views on the subject, including domestically, and including domestic voices that are very pro-Russianpro-Putin. However, the disproportionate response on Ukraine-related articles parroting the same points, often in the same syntax, gives lie to some of the more egregious sock-puppetting. It's something everyone does, though the Russians have a far more effective, technically skilled, and aggressive new media program than the inept, inward-focused forces of the USA. ..And for the record, though I still have relatives and friends in Ukraine, I am not in favor of direct US military involvement. I am, however, in favor of Europe - particularly Germany - showing some backbone and taking responsibility for the future of European security, and the advancement of democracy and human rights. To call the sanctions and support thus far pitiful would be an egregious understatement.","It's time to take control in other areas that Putin has sought to rata in influence; Syria, where international diplomacy has faltered due to Russian demands. Putin's strategy to control ports there, and build others in countries around Central America are about thwarting US influence and spreading Russia's military closer to the US, under other pretext.","It is interesting that there have been no comments on Crimea from the one country that could really sway Putin's decision. That is, of course, Turkey.  Turkey can close the Dardanelles and that would make the naval bases in Crimea (and the rest of the Black Sea) useless to Russia.","I see the current situation with Russia as just one more horrible consequence of the unjust US invasion of Iraq.  Knowing people who lived there at the time of the invasion, I know that the US-Russian relationship began its downward spiral at that time.  This isn't just about Putin.  Although Putin was the guy in charge at the time, the one to take advantage of the situation, he's not the only problem.  The problem is a shared problem with US and Russian leaders...The possibility that another Dick could be put into office, and yes, I mean Cheney, given the political realities of today give pause to any foreign nation that might otherwise be willing to trust the US and believe in our system...We did it.  Now we have to deal with the consequences...This isn't about standing like a man in front of Putin's aggression, rather it is about making friends with the Russian people and ignoring Putin's authority...This is how I see it.  How can this be carried out?  That is a harder question.","I look around my house and don't see anything made in Russia. That's the core problem that gives rise to a Putin. The world is not benefitting from the many talents of the Russian people. Innovations and products that it might produce have become stymied. Putin engages in saber-rattling to make Russians feel important. Instead, Russia should transform itself and join the international community in creating technology and cultural advances that improve and enrich life for everyone.","Historical parallels are rarely useful. I could just as easily draw the well-worn and equally specious parallel to Germany in the 1930s. And who said anything about all-out war? Do you think Putin's willing to commit to all-out war, for a few more square miles of territory? Seems more like he's seeing how much he can get away with before the West finally reacts strongly.",The problem is not the question of whether or not Khodorkovsky committed any crimes.  The odds are that he did.  The problem is the arbitrary use of the criminal justice system against political enemies.  Without meaningful separation of powers to keep the judiciary independent Khodorkovsky was not convicted because of evidence but because Putin wanted him to be and not because of the crimes he probably committed but because he was a political threat and controlled assets Putin wanted.
William Park,,,,I would argue that money reigns supreme. The stress on the ruble and the potential damage to the slowing Russian economy will ultimately cause Putin to negotiate some sort of compromise agreement.,"The hysterics over Putin reclaiming a part of Ukraine that has historical Russian ties and is viewed as vital to Russian interests is puzzling. The US has indeed spooked Putin with its NATO encroachment and its brazen wars of choice in Iraq and Afghanistan (about which Putin did not raise any fuss). Should he seize eastern Ukraine as well, it will likely be a white elephant, bringing inherent economic problems and civil unrest. At any rate, I don't see Putin's desire to maintain a Russian-friendly buffer zone as an outrageous act, especially in light of our own recent transgressions.",,,,,,,,
Sharkie,,,,"Europe needs to reorder some of its post-war borders and, unless there is an attack on NATO countries, we should let the Russians and Europeans sort it out themselves. Some things are going to have to change. Hungary gets Transylvania back in 2020 and the Sekely and Saxons should have their land back or be compensated.  South Tirol should be returned to Austria where it belongs.  There are probably other unjustoppressive borders that need to be redrawn, but much of the forced migrations of Stalin's era are established facts after more than 60 years... Russia is not overly threatening.  Its population is about half what it was at the high water mark of the Soviet era.  Russian security and European security are largely coterminous, especially in the matters of terrorism and mass migrants.  Instead of antagonizing Russia, NATO members should acknowledge its special security sphere.  President Putin is not going to threaten Finland, Poland and the Baltic states.  Nothing he has written has ever suggested that his Russia would wage war against the West.  His theme has been the problem of separatism and a belief that allowing Chechnya and Dagestan to split off would encourage the same in other regions all the way into Russia.  ..As for this Ukraine thing, it's pretty simple.  Russia needs to get its Russian populations back to stop its demographic losses.  Russia gets the Don basin, either as an autonomous nominally Ukrainian region or as a part of the Russian federation.","Are the lines unclear?  NATO vs. not NATO.  That seems like a bright line.  ..For better or worse - probably worse - NATO took in far-off millstone countries like Bulgaria.  Were Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia a good idea, maybe not, but the big trip wire protects them.  The Russians have a fearsome army for defending their country, but attacking NATO is completely different...According to Mr. Putin's writings, he is interested in protecting Russian regions and preventing separatism.  Absorbing parts of Finland or Hungary or even former Soviet regions like Moldova would be against his plan - why try to annex regions that will only want to break away?","Was there a tie between Putin and Angela Merkel?  President Putin's advertisement on Wikipedia indicates that he scared her with his dog.  Otherwise, there is no mention of a former tie.  I thought Angela Merkel had not been a politician in the DDR.  I would be interested to know if there are some ties. Maybe there are.  The State Security Police of the Democratic Republic enlisted every fourth person as a domestic spy (a big see-something-say-something campaign). That would be great to learn about, Physics professor Merkel reporting on her students to KGB leader Putin, but I don't think that happened.","Can't we just deal with reality here?  US Department of State and CIA made a horrible blunder inciting a revolution without being able to follow through. (Worse than a crime, it was a blunder - Napoleon's execution of the Duke of Enghein.)  Let us support a Ukrainian government that takes a prosperous neutral path in Russia's shadow like Finland, not some kleptocrat calling on us to send our sons to die for his country.  No Western leader seriously considers starting a war with Russia - only despots - the cost is too high.  State and CIA have been doing this a long time, sponsoring anti-Russian uprisings and letting the rebels hang  - Germany 1953, Hungary 1956  and Czechoslovakia 1968.  Every time it happens, the Russians make their power play.  Right or wrong, most ordinary Russians think the same way Mr. Putin does and are willing to go to war.  Thankfully, we're not.  Let the new NATO countries take a lesson and start paying their share of defense.","Dear Dan,  I do not think Mr. Putin wants peace and stability for Ukraine.  He wants a docile client state that poses no threat to Russia's oil and gas revenues, control of the armaments industry in the Don Basin and an example for other regions with Russian speaking populations.  He's going to get that.  ..The west needs to help Ukraine become another Finland and put it on a path to prosperity and neutrality.  If the EUUS had had that objective, Ukraine might have righted itself and avoided this mess.  Now we're going to waste more money on armaments in Europe at the expense of our economy and our influence in East Asia.  The idea of oil and gas pipelines to China is sickening.  ..The US needs to find better ways of engaging Russia in the future and it needs to stamp out the CIA and State Department cabal that helped precipitate this huge mess.","Of course the feeling is no thanks Mr. Putin, neo-Soviet KGB thug, but NATO does not want to fight over Ukraine and the Russians will go to any length to protect their petro revenue from competition with Ukrainian development of the Black Sea oil and gas deposits off Crimea (now lost to Russia).  ..The Russians have staked out their near abroad and are willing to go to war when they think they need to protect their claim - Chechnya in 1994-1996, South OssetiaGeorgiaAbkhazia in 2008 and now the Ukraine.  First under Boris Yeltsin and then as his own master (or so it seems), Mr. Putin has planned and initiated wars to prevent these near abroad regions from breaking away and prevent what Russian fear - a break-away domino effect.  In fact, Mr. Putin laid out this war making policy in published papers and a 2000 autobiography. ..This outcome was almost certain the day Mr. Yanukovich fled from Kiev and probably could have been mitigated or prevented all together were it not for the incompetence of our State Department and its Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland.  Instead of steering Ukraine on a course of neutrality, we supported a bellicose anti-terrorist war in the Don Basin that was sure to draw a Russian invasion with wide support from ordinary Russians.  ..Now how do we support the development of a neutral and prosperous Ukraine? The task is certainly more difficult than if we had heeded all the warning signs along the path that lead us here.",The United States and Russia got USSR nukes out of Ukraine in 1992-1994 precisely because Ukraine is a dangerous unstable region and someone would have sold the nukes to terrorists for big money.  I respectfully submit that Mr. Putin is not redrawing any maps but simply erasing some carelessly scratched pencil marks.,"You are so right.  Anyone suggesting stopping Putin or, like the NYTimes, Restoring Cold War Thinking could not lived before 1989...At the height of the cold war, the United States kept over half a million troops in West Germany.  Even with all the material and manpower the West could muster, NATO knew it could never win because the Russians always had a way of upping the ante.  Bigger nukes, faster deeper diving submarines, selective bio weapons, higher flying planes, we could never best them and we never did.  (They left on their own.)..We do not have the wealth or national will to go back to the cold war and I can assure younger people that they do not want to live in fear as we citizens did in those times.  That is why I say our Department of State and Presidency have handled an obvious outcome so miserably.  There was no need to make an enemy of Mr. Putin.  He was not sending missiles to Cuba or testing new doomsday bomb.  Now the hardliners are firmly in charge.","The US and NATO are providing signals intelligence and hardware to Ukraine to defeat Russia.  This type of western involvement is shortsighted and misguided.  Russia's defeat of the Golden Horde, the Tartars, the Uzbeks and other raiding peoples and its consolidation of control over northern Asia through the centuries has allowed the West to flourish.  With the rise of political Islam (terrorist states) and the surging birth rates in those regions, it is difficult to imagine how weakening the Russian state is in our long-term interests.  The federation of Ukraine would not harm short term Western interests. A plebiscite in the Don Basin earlier this year showed a majority of the Russian-speaking inhabitants would prefer more independence or becoming a Russian state.  It is not like our involvement here is to back democracy but rather to pursue a policy of containment. NATO cannot expand into Ukraine anyway because it is already over extended territorially and financially. It would appear we are in the grip of backward looking Cold War policies. Whether one likes Mr. Putin or not, the security and cohesion of a Russian state in central Asia serves our long-term interests. Many want to prevent Mr. Putin from consolidating a neo-Soviet empire, which is understandable, but in the long term, a strong Russia helps us. Do we want Khanates or Caliphates back in Central Asia, another Tamerlane? Our part in this conflict is just another misguided US foreign policy like Arab Spring.","The Ukraine is tedious.  It should go away.  Let Putin have if he wants it (though he does not seem to).  It's not a real sovereign country and it has been trouble since the day it left the disintegrating USSR.  Riots and governmental intrigues, leaders being jailed, human rights abuses, unpaid gas bills and economic crises, a disaster and an embarrassment.  (Like EU needs another run down head ache country; it already has Romania and Bulgaria and wishes it did not.)  ..Now there has been a right radical putsch and there are fascists in Ukraine's government.  What on earth are the US and the EU protesting and threatening Russia about unless it is cynical maneuver to expand corporate mercantile interests?  Pepsico and Exxon can sell there?  Maybe a chance to revive Dick Cheney's plans for an AzeriBaku oil and gas pipeline?  Stay out of this.  It's stupid.  Russia is far too useful in protecting Europe and suppressing terrorism to alienate it.  ..It's none of our business how Russians run their country and it's none of our business if they reabsorb part or all of their Ukrainian province.  Stay out of it.  Reading this article is almost unbearable.  How can anyone talk of having a military confrontation over Ukraine?  (How can anyone in the West even think of having a military confrontation with Russia?)  What folly.  ..I detect a coordinated propaganda effort here and an attempt by the US to exploit this situation."

Maybe ask how many of the so called Rebels are Russian Military and on Putin's payroll..The outcome would have been different if the Ukrainian military was US infused..These poor guys had to fight against the Russian military machine and the west stood idle twiddling their thumbs just as they did in 1939 with Hitler.,"Yes, Putin is proceeding slowly and purposely to rebuild the old USSR..Maybe he even will gain back the DDR while the world twiddles their thumbs..This whole mess is discussing and the West has blood on their hands.","Mark Morse you are correct nothing will stop Putin he has his eyes already on Poland , Hungary and the rest of eastern Europe while Merkel andUS send him soft balls and Putin send spit balls back. Putin owns Europe already just watch and see..Obama and Merkel the wrong people in power and the wrong time in history. Putin uses the power he has while US and Germany roll over.",go freeman with your point of view maybe we should let Mexico have Arizona Texas and California. I am sure you would not care..Land grab is not acceptable in Europe. Putin cannot be allowed to feed his ego with the lives and land of other countries. Putin will not stop with Ukraine he did not stop with Georgia.,"The US missed the opportunity to stop Putin early on.  We will either allow for the fall of Ukraine or arm them.  We are playing a weak hand.   Putin has tapped Russian nationalism, turned economic problems into his Nazi moment, and is raping the country economically.  Unlike most terrorists, he is a smart, thoughtful and powerful foe",One cannot negotiate with terrorists or Rebels as like to be called. Putin has handprint in Eastern Ukraine and therefore was the right person to negotiate with and hold responsible.,"Smart move for Putin.

Nick Metrowsky,,,,"I had a chance to read the printed edition of the 1 May, 2014 issue oF Russia Behind the Headlines yesterday:..<a hrefhttp:rbth.com titlehttp:rbth.com targetblank>http:rbth.com<a>..It effectively was 16 pages of justification of annexing east, southeast and southern Ukraine. And a further justification of united Russian lands and peoples. So, it comes to no surprise that Mr. Putin would effectively issue an ultimatum not only to Ukraine but to Europe, and NATO, as well...He also picked, May Day, the traditional Communist Workers Labor Day for this announcement...If events continue, on this course, Ukraine will eventually cede the desired lands. Mr. Putin, will then turn his attention to the Baltic States. A harder task, because they are in the EU and NATO. To Mr. Putin, The EU and NATO are irrelevant. And the actions of the EU, and NATO, only proves his point...One has to wonder how far west Mr. Putin will go, to save Russians from repressive foreign governments. Poland? Moldova? The Balkans? Slavic Republic? Hungary? Armenia? Former Central Asian SSRs?..Mr. Putin is laughing at economic sanctions. More so, he could freeze Europe by turning off several pipelines and bring down the European economy and ours with it. ..I never advocated force, before, but this may be the only recourse. If not, we may end up with a Russian Federation stretching from eastern Europe, east to the Pacific, from the Arctic to the Mongolian border and Caspian Sea. With most, if not all, of the old SSRs absorbed.","I hope Mr. Putin enjoys the headache he just inherited. I think the Tartars will do n Crimea, what Chechnians have done in Chechnya. Russia just created a second front on their war on terror.","This is the equivalent of 911 for Ukraine, Malaysia, the Netherlands and a number of other countries; it should be treated as such; a a cold, calculated, criminal act by terrorists. Mr. Putin, and his cohorts, are no different than Osama Bin-Laden and his cohorts. Call it what you want, but is falls into the category of crimes against humanity. ..Mr. Putin gave them the tools to do commit the act. He also created the situation by encouraging, the so called rebels. to fight a war to join Russia. Mr. Putin is also laughing off sanctions. Meanwhile, Europe, for fear of losing access to natural gas; fear Russia. And, the UN? Because of veto power, Mr. Putin knows he is free of any UN enforcement; including being tried in The Hague by the World Court. Unlike other dictators of the past, Mr. Putin knows far he can push, then push further. Mr. Putin's future? Once he has the territory, then his next plan is Russian purification; Russia for Russians. ..The world, right now, is powerless to stop Mr. Putin and hist goals of a unified Russian nation. Once he is done with Ukraine, the Baltic States are already on his agenda, s are Odessa and Moldova, and small strips of territory in Eastern Europe. And the Russian people? For the most part they are behind Mr. Putin, thanks to a propaganda mill in overdrive. ..The world now knows that Mr. Putin is a very dangerous man, just like a myriad of dictators and nobility that has plague the world since the beginning of civilization.","I a way, this is a good thing. apparently, in Russia, like the US, when money is involved, then the oligarchs push for a solution. Mr. Putin laments the fall of the Soviet Union, and the preceding Russian Empire. 19th and 20th Century methods no longer work; the United States also needs to learn this lesson...In today's world, using more diplomatic methods is the preferred way. Russia, though, did get the Crimea back. In a way, understandable that they wanted it back. Their naval fleet was in another country. A product of Soviet ineptitude and belief that their nation will last for centuries. Hitler had the same idea. His lasted fro 12 years; Lenin's for 74. ..If Russian speakers want to be in Russia, then they should move to Russia; simple as that. Russia, like the US, should throw off the yoke of paranoia that infests both countries, to try to build a better world. Instead of creating yet another conflict, on a planet that just have too many already...Mr. Putin has to realize that both the Russian Empire and Soviet Union are relics of the past. It is time to join the modern world where capitalism, democracy and freedom of choice now dominate. The industrialized west is ot without its problems, but until a better model comes along, it is the best we have...So, Mr. Putin it gratifying you are taking this step. Let's hope it produces positive results fro all concerned.","Up until 1954, the Crimea and south-east Ukraine were part of Russia. This occurred during the late 1700s. Effectively, Khrushchev tried to Russiafy the then Ukraine SSR to dominate the ethic population. Similar tactics were also done in Belarus, Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, during the years teh USSR was in existence. In addition to transporting peoples of these nations into the Russian interior or being purged by Stalin...This is much more complicated than Putin being a thng or Russia being brazen. You have Russians wanting to be part of their homeland. There is no real concept of this in the US. Only Native Americans can relate to this, as they were driven from their homelands to other territories; including into Canada...The Ukraine is effectively two nations, Ukrainian and Russian, A nation that did not truly exist, on its own, until the USSR broke apart  It was a forced marriage. More of something akin to Yugoslavia; an authoritarian government tried to keep it together. And like Yugoslavia; it will break up.  They have a choice, cede the lands peacefully (Like was done when Czechoslovakia broke into two countries) or by war (Yugoslavia breaking up into seven or eight countries)...Going to war over southeast Ukraine will only take countless lives, The Russians, the EU, and Ukraine need to settle this what is best for all concerned. The US should offer constructive help, as opposed to saber rattling and name calling.","80 years ago, in 1939, another ruler, in Europe, wanted to unite his people under one great government. Up until then, he was busy united his own country, dwelling on the past glories, etc. He wanted to restore pride to his people.  He wanted to create a nation that will last 1000 years. While the world stood by, he invaded Poland and Czechoslavakia.  He name, Adolph Hitler. Eventually, he set into motion the worst genocide and destructive wars in human history to unite all the Germanic peoples...Mr. Putin has the same aspirations in uniting the Russian peoples. If his agenda succeeds in Ukraine, the Baltic States are the next logical target. Economic sanctions, as useful as they are, may not be enough to stop Mr. Putin from his goal. Just like economic sanctions, and world wide condemnation, did not stop Adolph Hitler. ..This may require something more powerful like blockages to isolate Russia. It will require Europe to find other energy sources so they are not dependent on Russian. It is this dependency that limits what Europe can do. Meanwhile, in the US, after two horrific attempts of taming the Middle East, with abject failure, the American public, and maybe its government, have no desire to enter in another conflict...Mr. Putin knows all this too well. It is just a matter of time he does something, like other dictators, that the world will stand up to him. Unfortunately, it will take another war to do so.","Interesting. Almost similar to what George W. Bush said to justify going into Iraq and Afghanistan. Somehow his administration duped the world that Iraq posed a chemical weapons threat to start the Iraq War. And with Afghanistan, they swore Osama bin Laden was in Tora Bora, for all we know he was in Pakistan the whole time...What we get from this si simple. Politicians are the same all over. That they will say and do anything to justify their actions. In this case, going into a sovereign nation and taken what they say is theirs. And justifying it by saying that what was going on in Ukraine will shake teh very foundations of Russia. Yeah, and the Grand Duchy of Fenwick is about to take over the world...If Mr. Putin has any integrity, before teh conference, he lost that during the 66 minutes. No different than Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama losing theirs, during their reigns in office. Birds of a feather...What is worse than apologizing CEOs when they do something unethical or cause severe harm, are politicians lying to the electorate and the world to justify their actions. Even if these actions are wrong or cause undue harm...Mr. Putin is a coward, no different tha any other despot, or incompetent, that has ended up in a position of authority. Fortunately, in the afterlife, there is a very warm place for these kind of people. Their punishment for creating Hell on Earth.","Interesting. Almost similar to what George W.

That they will say and do anything to justify their actions. In this case, going into a sovereign nation and taken what they say is theirs. And justifying it by saying that what was going on in Ukraine will shake teh very foundations of Russia. Yeah, and the Grand Duchy of Fenwick is about to take over the world...If Mr. Putin has any integrity, before teh conference, he lost that during the 66 minutes. No different than Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama losing theirs, during their reigns in office. Birds of a feather...What is worse than apologizing CEOs when they do something unethical or cause severe harm, are politicians lying to the electorate and the world to justify their actions. Even if these actions are wrong or cause undue harm...Mr. Putin is a coward, no different tha any other despot, or incompetent, that has ended up in a position of authority. Fortunately, in the afterlife, there is a very warm place for these kind of people. Their punishment for creating Hell on Earth.","Russian may be denying shooting down the plane, but they provided the rebels with the surface to air missile capability. As today's editorial states, the Russians got what they wanted, Crimea, and things should have ended there. Unfortunately, Mr. Putin wants to create a new Russian Empire and yesterday's incident is the tragic result of these ambitions...It doe snot help that the Russian Government is feeding propaganda to the rebels, declaring Europe and the US as fascist states bent on the destruction of the Russian people. Mr. Putin created the monster and is complicit in yesterday's tragedy...Before this escalates further, cooler heads must prevail. Unfortunately, all that is stopping a major European conflict is a very weak and insignificant United Nations. Russia will veto any sanctions and UN actions that may be taken...Finally, to post blame on air traffic controllers questioning why a commercial airliners was flying 33,000 feed above  combat zone, is pure idiocy. No one think that someone would target and shoot down a commercial jetliner. Let's face it it is very easy to tell the difference, from the ground, between a commercial airliner and a fighter jet.","Amazing, that this even made it before the United Nations; let alone passing. Considering how Russia is part of the Security Council. apparently, they can't veto the General Assembly...The UN would be more effective, if the will of the world came before the interests of China, the US, France, Great Britain, and Russia (the permanent members). Eliminating their veto power would be a first great step...Yes, today's vote is symbolic and that is about it. It is tantamount to telling a restive child to quiet down, while they are screaming, at a high class dining establishment...Like:..Russia, you did a bad thing, and the world is not happy with it. Please, oh, please do not do anything more to make us vote against you again. Pretty please. We'll give you candy if you pleae behave...In a few weeks, Russia will have taken Trans-Dneiper east to Russia, east and south of the old Ukraine border, before the Soviets game that area in 1954. And the UN, will send another plea, as well the US, and the EU. And, Putin knows it."

So the reason the US and its 60 allies in the fight against ISIL have not yet succeeded in eliminating it is because they've not coordinated? Because they've not put volunteers and artillery on the ground? ..Somehow, despite the US and its allies flying more than 44,000 sorties against ISIL, Putin's mere 35 aircraft, 20ish helicopters, and the little green men are going to turn the tide?..The preposterousness of this comment should be enough to explain the head scratching.",The only thing megalomaniacs learn from other megalomaniacs is to do it right this time.

Isn't it more likely that Putin fears a successful, free Ukraine? Would it not stand as proof that his government is a fraud?",Any settlement with Putin would be temporary. He wants the port of Mariupol then a land bridge to the Crimea. His next destination is Odessa. A ceasefire is merely a device to Putin.,"Be cautious in reading these comments. The Russian politburo has an excellent PR wing. They will tell you that Putin's principles are honorable and that the Ukrainians are Nazis. They think the West is weak that Merkel is a pawn to German economic interests. They will tell you that the trouble in Ukraine was caused by US desires to push NATO to the Russian doorstep. They will tell you that the Maiden revolution of 2015 that threw out the Russian puppet was illegal --- as if people don't have right to decide their destiny. Read carefully! Be critical! Remember, the folks in the politburo had us convinced the Cuban missile crisis was all our fault.","War in the late 20th century evolved into conflicts involving small groups. Putin is fighting this war in Ukraine, has fought it in Georgia and elsewhere, and will eventually get around to other neighbors in the Baltics. We should be stepping up. After years of experience imbibed in Viet Nam, and other similar conflicts, we have the edge..Europe should be involved, it's their war for freedom. Poland and other threatened states should be creating their own special forces for dealing with Putin's warriors. The US should be working with them, and the Ukrainians to hit and run --- into Russia if it is necessary.","The only options that makes sense is to give up at let Putin continue his march into Eastern Europe or actively participate. The US could quickly destroy an over-extended line of supply if we ignore borders, as our enemy has, and hit Russia itself.","Putin has lost control; I've suspected this for a week. Unfortunately, as Powell said about Iraq, If you break it you own it, this could be a lingering drain on Russia and Putin. His only choice, regardless of how the elections turn out are to help Europe cure the situation and quell the insurrection. Putin doesn't need Ukraine as an enemy. This crisis will be on the mend when we see Putin reaching out for help.","Mather,.Being out-numbered 4-5 to one is expected for our air force. We trained for that contingency. No other forces really matter. And, our are 10 times better than theirs. If you own the sky, it is driving a tank division that is suicide. We have bunkers full of snake and nape. The problem is Putin's tactics are to secretly disrupt a neighbor. They do it by night. They don't wear insignia. This can only be stopped by getting them at their bases -- in Russia. That is where we need to fight Putin. If he loses this one, in Ukraine, he is done.","So, Putin is attacking our allies directly? That's war. We should inform them that next time, they will be shot down.","They are fighting on the opposite side of a war from us. They are, in fact, at war with us. The correct response is to warn them, one last time, then knock them out of the sky. ..Before someone talks about the nuclear threat, just remember that Putin is outgunned in that department too and won't risk suicide for prestige. ..When a bully threatens you, your choices are to back down or fight. He is forcing our hand: fight!","What propaganda spiel? The Obama administration is largely ignoring Ukraine. It shouldn't given what Putin has already done around the Black Sea and is starting to do in the Baltic...Your logic seems a little faulty. The Bay of Pigs was stupid and wrong; the CIA admitted that quickly. Nicaragua was not. We were fighting communism in Central America. Russia, then the USSR, supported Nicaragua, which exported it elsewhere, including Mexico. So, you have one bad comparison and another good one. Ukraine is on the border of Russia --- I get that. But there is a big difference: Ukraine isn't trying to export revolution into neighboring countries. ..Of course, if your a Russian nationalists, it doesn't matter if Ukraine is a real threat or not. It's all about empire. This nationalism must be stopped and Ukraine is the battlefield Russia has chosen. This is a test; if the west fails, Russia moves on to plan B: neutralize eastern Europe, the Scandinavian countries and finally western Europe."

Details matter whether it is placing the blame for the failure of the reset on Pres. Obama, or Hillary Clinton or ultimately Vladimir Putin...The notion of a reset with someone like Vladimir Putin was jejune in the first place whether or not it was well executed.  However, the ultimate responsibility for the idea would have been with President Obama.","The U.S., E.U. and other Western nations must begin to take the long view and support Ukraine with financial aid and education to create a society based on rule of law and equal opportunity. The advantage of doing so is tremendous in terms of countering Putin. Just as the Ukrainians have looked to see Poland's development since 1989, the Ukrainians may inspire the Russians to move past their Soviet legacy. This is why Putin is so eager to co-opt Ukraine. It is discouraging to see a lack of resolve to confront Putin by the E.U. (who has the natural gas that Europe needs) and by the U.S. The Ukrainians have risked all and will lose all without immediate assistance.","Irate,..The U.S. along with Britain and the Russian Federation signed the Budapest Memorandum to guarantee the integrity of Ukraine in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons that has been part of the Soviet arsenal and were left there after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991...If Ukraine is carved up, expect Putin to create greater instability in the region.  ..In addition to the link below, I suggest reading Edward Lucas, who has an updated edition entitled The New Cold War that was released in August, 2014.

Putin has counted on Obama's inaction.,"Is it paranoid when Russia is once again moving troops to the border?

Yanukovych robbed the country blind and when he needed more money, he could not sign the agreement with the EU that would have put an end to his thievery.  Yanukovych could have stayed in Ukraine, but his security force deserted him..The U.S. did sign a security agreement in 1994 when Ukraine gave up its Soviet era missiles.  The men who signed the agreement were Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton, Leonid Kravchuk (then Ukrainian president) and John Major..Putin will push for a destabilized Ukraine to enhance Russia.  A wealthy, secure, stable Ukraine is a threat to Russia because everyday Russians will become dissatisfied with an autocracy that caters to the oligarchs.  And to the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (which were considered captive nations from 1940 to 1991), it shows how little has changed from Soviet times.  The failure of the Obama administration to respond more vigorously has Eastern Europe worried as well as Japan since China has started sabre rattling..In 2008, Hillary Clinton was criticized for questioning whether Barack Obama would be ready for the 3:00 a.m. crisis.  This is the type of crisis she meant..Since Pres. Obama gave up more than he got in negotiations with Republicans or the red line with bombing Syria, Putin has gambled that repercussions for Crimea &amp; inciting unrest by Russian provocateurs will be few.","It is also imperative that Washington and Brussels do more to assist Ukraine in training its military and national guard as well as updating its equipment.  ..In the first few days after Yanukovych fled, both Washington and Brussels encouraged Ukraine to get along with Russia, in effect throwing Ukraine to the wolf.  When Russia invaded Crimea by the end of the week, it became a crisis.  Washington and Brussels were caught off guard as though they did not anticipate that Putin would take some kind of action once the Sochi Olympics ended.  How did they not have a better reading on Putin based on his actions in Russia since he resumed the presidency?","Although it seems that progress has been made, there does not seem to be any concessions from Russia.  They are not returning Crimea, nor are they withdrawing troops from the border...The U.S. position was considerably weakened when Obama said that there would be no military assistance to Ukraine.  And while I would also prefer not to have the U.S. military involved, it was not a strategically wise move to come out and say it, as Obama did, at the beginning of this crisis.  It has been the equivalent of leaving the door open for Putin to use to march into Ukraine without fear of retribution.  Putin has laughed at previous sanctions.  And the sanctions are weaker than they could be considering European dependence on Russian oil and natural gas...It also seems that Putin's actions have been to make the upcoming vote on May 25 as questionable as the vote in Crimea.  So I have no expectation that Putin's actions to keep Ukraine in a weakened state of dependency on Russia will stop.   What will Russians think if they see a stable, prosperous, democratic Ukraine on their border?  Will they want the same for themselves?","Since the column mentioned that these groups do not work well with similar countries, Putin's funding of these groups would allow him to destabilize the EU.  Putin would be able to play one country against each other with gas prices and penalize them the way he has in Ukraine for not playing along.","Putin's influence on these groups is a reflection of Putin's creation of an autocracy in Russian.  In this, Putin has been influence by Alexsandr Dugin who one wrote that Russia needs authentic, real, radically revolutionary and consistent fascism...What is happening in Ukraine and with these parties in Europe is more understandable when taking a look at Putin's inner circle."
TDurk,,,,"Vladimir Putin clearly views himself as a tsar.  That Russians support him is their prerogative.  ..Ukrainians detest Russians.  Always have, always will.  Russians reciprocate the attitudes...Yes, the Ukrainians pulled off a coup to expel the Russian puppet.  Yes, the Russians pulled off an earlier coup to put the Russian puppet in power...Yes, the Europeans were sublimely indifferent until the Russians east of the border enabled the Russians west of the border to shoot down the passenger jet.  Then the Europeans were shamed into being pushed by the United States to invoke economic sanctions against Russia...So what?..Obviously, in geo political terms, Tsar Putin and his mercenaries are similar to Hitler's nazis.  But they pose no threat whatsoever to the US.  They are a European problem and it is well past time that Europeans take care of their own back yard, starting with honoring their defense spending commitment to NATO.  ..President Obama is waging the best possible foreign policy against the resurgent imperialist actions of Putin's Russia.  Economic sanctions.  By forcing the Europeans to participate and to bear the military burden, President Obama is signaling that the US is no longer willing to be unpaid mercenaries for the defense of Europe...He is also signaling to the Russians that life under Putin's policies will be miserable.  ..Finally, he is signaling to Ukrainians that if they want to be Europeans, then they have to convince Europeans to support their cause.","Crimea is Russian.  Kruschev's 1950's action to merge Crimea and Ukraine was motivated by his need to make the Ukrainians more pro-Russian, or perhaps better stated, less anti-Russian.  But Crimea is Russian just as much as Ukraine, or Poland are not Russian...Everybody recognizes that Crimea is and probably should be Russia.  Everybody fears that Russia may deem Ukraine or Poland or the Baltics as Russian.  Everybody knows the precedents...So the issue is the way by which Russia has gone about its annexation of Crimea.  From the language of the western governments, it seems clear that they were willing to see Crimea reintegrated with the pre-1950s Russia.  But they wanted it done with some semblance of legalism, a fig leaf if you will.  Putin, for his own domestic and international political reasons, wasn't interested in the western legalisms, despite signing on to those terms through multiple international agreements...In some respects, Putin's actions evoke memories of if you aren't with us, you're against us.  I suspect there are consequences to national actions, as Putin may or may not experience, depending on how the financial impacts add up for both sides.","While Vladimir Putin may have put on the czar's robes, his anti - European behavior is more evocative of Joe Stalin than Czar Nicholas.   Like Hitler, Stalin was a ruthless expansionist who used propaganda and covert operations to justify his actions.  Also like Hitler, Stalin punished internal dissenters while calling on Russians to honor their country.  Putin is a reincarnation of Stalin...That said, the European vulnerability to a more aggressive Russia is entirely of their own making.  Of the major European economies, only the UK &amp; France spends the required 2 of GDP on defense spending.  The defacto defense strategy of Europe is to depend on the US (4.4 of GDP on defense) for its defensive needs while spending their own money on social welfare programs...Personally, I believe that spending a nation's wealth on social welfare is a far better use of resources than spending it on B stealth bombers.  However, when a Hitler type of person emerges, then it's time to turn plowshares into swords.  Putin is that type of person...The important thing to note here is that this is a classic European geopolitical power struggle.  It is not ours to solve, no more so than it's our ability to persuade Saudi Arabia to cease its theocratic form of government in favor of a republican democracy.  ..America has the military might to reduce the Soviet Union to radioactive dust.  We also have the might to defeat them with conventional weapons.  That still doesn't make it our fight.","Ukraine is not America's fight.  It is Europe's fight.  It should be waged as an economic fight with European leadership...Putin and his acolytes are clearly delusional if they think their reversion to soviet era propaganda and lies have any credence outside of their tightly controlled media.  But they still have the backing of the Russian military and so long as they do, they will continue their pressure on former soviet vassal states.  ..So the trick must be to exacerbate the internal fissures within Russia and in particular have the military to rethink their support of Putin...Germany is the most powerful economic force on the European continent.  The battle with Russia should be fought on economic terms since a military engagement between Europe and Russia would be devastating even if the war stayed below the nuclear threshold.  If it went nuclear, several European nations have nukes in addition to the silos in the US that are probably on alert and are targeted on soviet  Russian targets even as we speak.  ..The Russians don't want a nuclear engagement, but would probably welcome a conventional clash before Germany ever lives up to its NATO defensive funding commitments...So the best alternative is to keep this an economic war.  Russia will lose this and at some point, the internal contradictions within Russia will result in Putin's ouster.","From the fall of Gorbachev to the 2d coming of Putin, American administrations have tried to relegate Russia to the trash heap of history.   Our leaders have confused the Russian need for a working economy via state capitalism for a lack of patriotism and pride in a powerful country.  We confused Glasnost with capitulation.  We seriously underestimated the staying power of the communist party's muscle...It should be obvious by now that communism per se, as a governing ideology, doesn't mean much in Russia or China for that matter.  Political parties there are merely a means to organize and stroke the will of the people in support of the ruling oligarchy.  Who, despite their tendencies to act more like Columbian drug lords than statesmen on a personal level, for the most part appear to be genuinely proud of Russia and defensive about western efforts to marginalize Russia in world affairs.  ..No matter that Bush II could see into the soul of Putin I.  or not.  No matter than Obama believed he could reset relations with Russia without recognizing Putin's stated intent to re-establish Russia as a world power alternative to the United States.  and China.  Our leaders have been wrong to ignore that Russia views itself as a world power and will act as a viable and powerful alternative to US policy demands...Putin has abrogated its signed treaties with regard to Crimea.  He knows that treaties are almost always broken and history is written by the victors.","Ukraine owes Russia about 3.5B for unpaid natural gas bills &amp; did sign a purchase agreement with Russia in 2009 to obtain gas at the prices that Gazprom has threatened to charge going forward.  The lower prices the NYT mentions were subsidized by Russia which is not willing to subsidize them further going forward.  Ukrainian govt corruption in collusion with Russian oligarchical corruption created the mess...Ukrainians hate Russians.  In WWII they initially supported the German invasion and only fought against the Germans when Nazi atrocities turned out to be worse than Stalin's atrocities.  The Soviets tried to tamp down Ukrainian resistance to Russian rule by combining Russian Crimera with Ukraine.  That hasn't worked out so well...Putin has a mess on his hands of his own making.  Whether Ukraine is facist or not is irrelevant.  At worst, if Russia tries to conquer Ukraine by military force, he will have a potential Chechnya on his hands or an Afghanistan like defeat to contend with.  At best, he will have a basket case economy to support and a subjugated people in constant revolt as an example to other national minorities under the Russian sphere of political control.  That's assuming the Europeans will acquiesce to Putin; if they do impose further sanctions, the entire Russian economy will suffer, the Russian people will lose their enthusiasm for Putin's patriotism, and we will revisit the truly ugly years that lead up to the collapse of the Soviet Union.","For those who insist on comparisons to WWI and WWII as reasons for the US to fight in this situation, you are wrong and certainly have not studied the history of those eras.  ..WWI was a catastrophic occurrence that resulted from the labyrinth of treaties that obligated the intermarried families of European rulers to go to war in the event that one of their partners was attacked.  Our participation in that event was misguided.  Our interests were not threatened by any of the participants and we had no treaty obligations to defend...The German and Japanese right wing facists were clearly a strategic threat to the United States.  While our histories emphasize the political hold that Hitler and Tojo had over their countries, the sad truth of the matter was that their populations overwhelmingly supported their leaders.  They truly believed in their racial supremacy notions and truly believed that their opportunity to establish empires akin to the European empires was at hand.  It would be only a matter of time before we clashed and even then, the Axis attacked us...Putin is determined to re-establish the Eastern bloc buffer zone between Russia and Europe.  Clearly there is no military threat from either western or eastern Europe to Russia.  There is the economic, political and cultural threat which over time will doom the Russian oligarchs if left unchecked.  That is what Putin is fighting to prevent...As horrible as that may be, that does not constitute a threat to the US.","Putin is lying of course.  He wants neither sanctions nor a shoot-out with the Ukranians even if his forces would likely win decisively in such an event.  He will keep lying until he gets what he does want, which is the restoration of the Soviet Union's former borders...The resolution of the issue is actually simple.  Ukranians and Europeans must face off with Russian.  Germany, France, the UK, Urkraine, Poland, et al have larger populations, much larger economies and sufficient military capacity to defend against a Russian invasion.  The issue is will power.  Europe lacks the willpower to defend the eastern borders.  As previous articles have pointed out, the European NATO partners do not contribute the minimum commitment of 2 GDP to their defense budgets.  They expect the US to cover their ... needs...The US has zero strategic interests in this area even if we are morally outraged.  When the usual chickenhawks in Congress or on the right wing choose to squawk about what they would do if they were in charge, send them to fight alongside the Europeans.  Until then, expose the perfidy of Putin, the fecklessness of the Europeans and the hypocrisy of our right wingnuts.  Impose Iranian level sanctions and see if the French or the Germans will actually support them.  Send arms to Ukraine on lend lease terms, or maybe to Germany so they can arm their neighbors...But its not our fight.","Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key.  That key is Russian national interest...Winston Churchill was right in 1939 and his admonition is worth thinking about today.   In 1939, Stalin allied Russia with Nazi Germany to destroy Poland.  In 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded Russia with the objective of destroying Russia, Stalin was ready to strike alliances with the UK and the US.  It should be noted that Russia's defeat of Germany on the eastern front was the primary reason why the Nazis were defeated in Europe by 1945.  ..By the time of Gorbachev and the collapse in 1989-1991, the derelict central planning & control of the Soviet economy, along with Afghanistan and a military budget that consumed nearly 20 of GDP combined to break apart the Soviet empire.  Glasnost and Perestroika informed the people then and its power then pales in comparison to the power of today's internet.  It's not likely that today's Russian censors can defeat the internet, so as the oil economy stagnates and the cost of Putin's military posturing eats up more of the budget, Russians will likely respond...The Russian national interest today may or may not coincide with Putin's interest.   At some point, the internal propagandists will lose out to the reality of the outside world and Russians will have to choose where their national interests actually lie.  Back in 1939 and 1941, Stalin alone made the decisions.  Today, only Russians can make that call.","The puzzling thing about the current situation is that the US had not gone public with satellite and  or communications intelligence that will prove the Russians are doing what it appears they are doing.  The Cuban Missile Crisis comes to mind; unfortunately so too does Colin Powell and WMD.  Credibility is a terrible thing to waste, but GWB and Cheney did waste our credibility...That said, if we have the G2 that is incontrovertible, we should publicize it for the world to clearly come to terms with Mr Putin and his latter day incarnation of Adolph Hitler...Trouble is, in that event, whose duty is it to deal with Putin and his expansionist plans for Russia?  This is clearly a European dilemma, but the NATO nations have not, and apparently will not fund or resource for their own defense.  None have maintained the 2 of GDP defense funding required of NATO members.  Between them, Germany and France have more than sufficient manpower and technology to challenge Putin.  Perhaps if they showed more willingness to confront him, the UK might weigh in.  Only then should the US do more than what we are doing right now...At this point, the strategic folly of Bush and Cheney are really becoming manifest.  The US declared a war of pre-emption on Iraq, mobilized the same troops repeatedly for about ten years and our population has had enough of presidential wars of ambition.   ..This is Germany's time to demonstrate some regional leadership and atone for their 20th century legacy."

Russian TV would claim that it's the American news that do propaganda (never mind that there are so many independent news in US, whereas it's all state TV in Russia). Putin would say that US CIA organized a coup, never mind that there are Russian tanks and green men occupied Crimea, and are all over east of Ukraine now. ..Just this Saturday, Kremlin-backed army bombarded Mariupol (the residential areas), 30 Ukrainians died, 102 injured (many women and kids).  Putin must be stopped before it's too late","Russians are killing a lot of people in Ukraine. If Ukraine got occupied by Russia, even more people dies, and war comes to the border of Europe.  ..History repeats itself, European leaders once closed their eyes on Hitler initially too (when he occupied a few countries). It's far away, it doesn't concern us, not our fight And Eventually the WW2 began, and so many people died. ..Putin wants to recreate USSR 2.0, he will kill people and annex land from all it's neighbors. He wants his regime to be everywhere.   That's why main friends of Russian are  North Korea, Venezuela, etc. If Putin's regime succeeds it will affect everybody (in US too). The world be united, and Putin must be stopped before it's too late.","Russia is a main sponsor or terrorism. Every terror in the world only benefits Russia - Putin would only emphasize how important his secure state regime is. Russia needs oil prices to go up (and I wouldn't be surprised if Putin sponsors ISIS to achieve it). ..Putin and his regime is much worse than (ISIS) - it's the whole state that behaves like terrorist. Read the OSCE report, where Russia-back gangs bombarded a peaceful Ukrainian city of Moriupol on Jan 24, 2015 (30 civilians got killed, 100 injured)","As someone from Ukraine, I must tell you that Maidan-protest was against corruption and against dictatorship of ex-president Yanukovich. Everybody is so happy that he finally gone. If not for Russian aggression , Ukraine would be well on its way to become a great Europe country now. ..US had missteps in the World, but also did a lot of good. South Korea - is one example. It's a blossoming economy with many high-tech companies. If not for US, it could have been a part of North Korea now.  In fact North Korea is one Putin's friend, their leader will be visiting Putin this spring (birds of feather stick together)..German is another example, US heavily supported its economy not to let it get under USSR control, and Germany now is one of the best European economies (as well as places to live in). ..Same thing with Ukraine. It can become a free, democratic prosperous country in a European family, or it can get occupied by Russian regime (again) with many people killed.","Ask yourself if you are walking on a street and notice several bullies hitting a person and trying to kill himher, will you help? It's not your fight, and you can just walk by,  but then one day you can be the one who is in trouble but nobody will help.....Once Putin recreates USSR2.0 it will influence everybody (US people too). Putin will also support all other dictatorship countries, including the ones close to US borders. Putin and his friends will try to establish his autocratic regime on other countries, and undermine anybody who is against it.","Funny little article. A lot of truth to it . Although it would be nice of you to mention the fact that under Putin , Jews enjoy most prosperous period in Russian history. Not a small fact , considering that you, me and hundred of thousands of Russian Jews left that country because of chronic anti-antisemitism.","Hey, it's not a puppet regime. Finally this bloody ex-president Yanukovich ran away (which was in fact Putin's puppet), and now Ukrainian people are hopeful of its future. If not for Russian aggression, Ukraine would be on its way to a great European country, you want to visit one day.  ..Ukraine needs defend weapons to protect its people and its land, now as never before.","That's just a weird statement. Each situation is different. ..If a part of California were occupied by Russian green-men with modern weapons that claim to protect e.g. Spanish-speakers, what would you do? it's not different here.  All Putin wants for the world is to do nothing, while he slowly occupies Ukraine, and kills more people there.","I don't think people understand the danger of Putin's regime, and that Russia is slowly becoming a fascist state. (I do think Merkel (and Germans) do see it more then other countries)..Hitler occupied Czechoslovakia under the same false excuse of protecting ethnic Germans. Same thing in Ukraine.  I am a Russian speaker and ethnic Russian, and nobody  wants to do anything with Russia here in Ukraine..Russian propaganda brainwashed Russians(just like Goebbels in Nazi Germany). Russia has full media control (all TV channels) and full economy control, following all footsteps of fascist state.  ..Putin obviously wants to re-create USSR 2.0, he openly stated that the collapse of USSR was a largest tragedy. I've lived in USSR and I know how awful it is, and how dangerous it is for the world.  Media brainwashes you that your state regime is the only correct one, and and we must fight against the USA and Europe - the enemies.  Putin and his regime must be stopped before it's too late.",well put. Putin must be stopped before it's too late. I don't think people understand the danger of pacifying him..
OrtoAzia,,,,"The real and only question that matters is ' Is Putin weighing talks with the White House'. The way the guy is rolling, the White House will need to get on the wait list to be seen by Putin.","The KGB psychoanalysis of Putin in explaining almost anything that goes on in Russia is just getting old and worn. When the only tool one has is a hammer, then everything else looks like a nail. So is the our flawed understanding of Russia and other nations. We use the same tool that we are comfortable with to explain pretty much anything. It is about time we move to more detailed and nuanced understanding of our opponents and give them the same credit we grant on ourselves. What and why Russia is doing in Syria is ultimately not too different from why we are doing it.","The junta in Kiev should grab this opportunity and run with it. They have killed enough innocent people (the victims the 'civilized' world is willing to overlook). This is the best opportunity for the far-right junta in Kiev to legitimize themselves. ..According to UN, more than 800,000 people have already fled to Russian. Furhter 200,000 are displaced internally. It's an ethnic cleansing right in front of our eyes. So Putin is being really generous with the offer to mediate a cease fire with the rebels. The junta should take his offer as it stands.","All this pennies compared to what Russia has undergone in 1998 and worse in 1991: single digit contraction, double digit inflation may seem alarming in the west. But in Russia this is a very acceptable price; if that is what Russia needs to pay for returning (!) Crimea and keeping the prospect of the same for Donbass. Heck, I'd say it's even cheap. ..Time and again, what astonishes me is the Western Russia watchers betting on economic sanctions breaking the back of Russia and somehow making it either return Crimea or even leaving Donbass alone. These watchers naively overlook the non-economic, emotional aspect. Even if Russia contracts by double what is reported in the piece, there is simply no way of going back for it. The catastrophe (nor less) of what Russia has gone through in early 1990s makes anything else pale in comparison. A country that has undergone THAT and lost territory is surely going to overcome THIS and gain territory. After all they outlived and defeated Nazis when all (including us in US) have all but written them off by 1942. ..As a Russian saying goes: Putin will even catch a cold at the funeral of those who are indulging in schadenfreude over Russian economy now.","The only loser in all this are the small East European countries.

Brussles didn't even dare to say anything about North Stream violating any EU rules. The South Stream would be of enormous benefit to Bulgaria and other transit countries. Putin is correct. But pressured by Brussles, Bulgaria had indeed lost the opportunity to act like a sovereign country. And it's a loss for her...Now, we can try to paint this as Russian defeat, but Russia will export its energy at the end. The only losers here is Europe itself. It may take a while for it to realize it shot itself in the foot. In the protracted and convoluted politics of EU the head doesn't know what the tail wants. So it may take a while before that bullet hits the foot. By then Russia will have moved on. Let's see who's defeat it is then.","The only loser in all this are the small East European countries.

These are the bunch of Ukrainian tycoons and crooks (much worse than the ones NYT seem to expose in the article) who have violently removed a democratically elected government, no less. Putin's only fault in all this is that he challenged (and rightly punished) a junta that happens to be pro-Western. Our sons of gun have been routed and disciplined by Putin. And we can't seem to be able to swallow that bitter pill.",,,

Steven,,,,"That is like throwing a spanner in the works. Poroshenko and Putin have already agreed on a permanent ceasefire, and talks are underway. That is a positive development. Why the need for more sanctions.","Doubting Obama, Putin Prepares Tanks...You see how this goes?..With the imminent partitioning of Ukraine, the EU should be dead and in full economic free-fall, without heat, this autumn and winter...Nice going.","Putin is nothing more than a KGB communist who would like to see Ukraine as part of Russia. Now that Ukraine is divided into 2, the west and the east, he probably thinks he can concur the easter pro-russia regions and make it part of russia. There are a lot of russians who live in that part of Ukraine and majority probably want to be part of Putins russia. They and their little dictator forget that region is UKRAINE.  What should happen in my opinion that the new Ukranian goverment gets into EU and also becomes a NATO member. That will prevent Putin from moving in his army's into Ukraine. In conclussion, never trust a russia KGB man, Putin. They hate everybody not russian, and specifically americans. They know they will never be as good as USA, their economy is on a level of third world countries, their rubble is in trouble and most improtantly Putin is very concerned that what happened in Ukraine will happen in Russia. People are fed up with him and in the future Putins fate maybe the same as the fate of the ukrainian presidnet Yanukovich. I hope I am right, many millions in Russia hope I am right.","This is a very bad situation for Ukraine and other former USSR Baltic Republics. Putin's ambitions right now is to bring back USSR and  grab as much as he can. And he will not give up until he succeeds, he will not stop. So how do you fight him? Answer - economically. Putin holds entire Europe hostage with his supply of gas and oil. As long as he supplies the West, he is making money. If oil is at least 90 a barrel, he is profiting. You take that away from him, and his country is bankrupt. This is were USA comes into play. We need our wonderful president Obama to start drilling oil and gas. We have more oil and gas than Russia. Not only are can become energy independent, we can supply gas and oil to Europe and that will be a blow to Putin and his bandit state. That is when money stops flowing into Russia and their economy becomes weaker than it is now. Is there any other alternative? No there isn't. If we don't do what I described above, we have a lot to loose. After all Europe is in trouble because Putin knowing well nobody is stopping him can move against Europe as well. Just FYI - in some russian newspapers lately they are talking about getting Alaska back, and they mean it.  Putin declared he will go into any place in the world where russian live and ask for help because they feel they are being mistreated. Is NY next because there are about 1 million russians in metropolitan area? hmmmmmm","BUK is not simple to operate, you need extensive training.  A rebel (call him terrorist) can't not acquire the know how without training from russians. I believe the russian military is part of the rebel separatists and are fighting the ukrainians on the rebel side. They the russian instructors most likely fired the missiles. Putin was and is a dangerous person and his lies are very well known.","Putin is buying time.  He and his subordinates will have discussions but will not alter his plan.  Lavrov met with Kerry and said after to the Russian press that Kerry had agreed to go back to the Feb 21 agreement between the EU and Yanuchovich.  This was an absurd lie.  The Russians also say its not their troops in Crimea.     Negotiations and talks are useless.  They meet with western leaders pretending they might agree to something.  In reality they buy time to send more Russians into eastern Ukrainian cities trying to foment increased unrest in Ukraine.  They hope this agitation escalates, justifying their occupation of more territory.  They will not leave Crimea and even though Putin said yesterday he would not annex Crimea, it his exact plan.  Crimea is having a referendum this month on secession.  Putin will make sure no International observers are present, but ballot stuffers are.  He will then recognize independent Crimea, make it an official protectorate and annex.  He is trying his damnest to do the same in eastern oblasts as well.  The western powers better get tough with Putin and fast because his control of the situation on the ground grows daily.  The west needs to unite, impose heavy sanctions and beef up NATO security forces and make this thug (Putin) back down..What I cannot understand about the Russian is the way he will lie when he knows perfectly well you know he is lying. - Theodore Roosevelt",,,,
J. Von Hettlingen,,,,"Three months ago, a broad amnesty was being proposed to Putin by the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council. Putin must have pulled the strings behind the scene, or else it would not have happened..Mikhail Fedotov, the head of this Council, said then the amnesty would only be applied to prisoners, who were non-violent offenders..Meanwhile, Germany's former foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher must have appealed to Putin and requested for Khodorkovsky's release, as part of this sweeping amnesty. The Winter Olympics in Sochi are one occasion that Putin doesn't want to spoil. Germany's president, Joachim Gauck has already announced that he would not travel to Sochi in February..Putin decided to release Khodorkovsky as he also wanted to demonstrate that he respects the Russian constitution, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary.","Khodorkovsky's possible release gave rise to much speculations. He had in the past repeatedly said that he would not ask Putin for a pardon because it would be tantamount to admitting guilt. Yet he is said to have  asked  for clemency because his mother was ill. Putin then decided to grant him a pardon..Khodorkovsky's mother told the media that she did not know about any clemency request by her son. There were rumours that Khodorkovsky may have decided to seek a pardon, knowing about the sweeping amnesty and following  the threat of a third trial against him...Perhaps Putin thinks that after 10 years in jail, Khodorkovsky's star has faded, and inside Russia most people will pay him little attention. Well, this has yet to be tested. One thing is sure, as long as he remains in Russia, he is subject to the Kremlin's scrutiny. Any inappropriate statement or action could get him again into trouble.","Putin was very shrewd, when he said that the loan was to support the people of Ukraine, not the government. It's the people, the common people that suffer..If he could let Ukraine cultivate European connections while also engaging with the Russian-led customs union, it would be another diplomatic victory for him. After all the Russian speaking East will not be Europeanised overnight and the population there will still maintain ties of kinship.","The EU sees Russia as part of Europe, yet Putin wants Russia to go its way, preserve its Slavic identity - the equivalence of American exceptionalism.","As the author, Ms Bohlen asserts, what Putin might do with Ukraine after the Sochi Games is unknowable. He is unpredictable and loves to surprise the world. In fact it is a real pity that Fyodor Dostoyevsky is not alive. He would have captured Putin's psyche in one of his novels.",,,,,
David,,,,"Putin has already won that confrontation with the West. Crimea belongs to Russia. In perpetuity. Everything else is pocket change in comparison to this most important outcome of the West's Ukrainian gambit. Extension of sanction by six month is not a big setback to Putin. It is a foregone conclusion - no one expected otherwise, least of all Putin himself. The delusional thinking in the West, so perfectly exemplified by this piece, will help it nothing and will hurt Putin even less.","Reading some of the comments in support of Putin truly underscores the NYT article about the Russian trolls paid by the government to spread disinformation. ..I don't know who these Russian trolls believe the are influencing, but I can assure them that they are high comedy to educated and well-informed NYT readers...We all know America is not perfect. We all know no country in the world is perfect...But I will take America's legal system, freedom of speech, educational system, business environment and respect for individualism any day of the week over Russia...We can discuss America's imperfections and not fear arrest, expropriation of all our possessions or death...We believe in a Constitution that doesn't change weekly...Despite all our disagreements, we move forward to attempt to achieve the equality, freedom and protections articulated by our nation's Founders...People are trying to immigrate to the United States while they are trying to emigrate from Russia. ..That fairly sums it up.","Good relations between the West and Russia will have to wait until Putin has been deposed. ..Putin was barred by the constitution from standing in presidential elections, having already served two consecutive terms as president. ..He promptly disposed of that little constitutional issue by becoming president again in 2012...Russia has no laws that are meaningful and consistently applied...It spins so many lies despite self-evident truth to all with senses that words from the government are meaningless distractions...No citizen there has security, rights or self-worth that can't be taken away in a moments breath...Putin makes it very easy to understand what lever is effectively being deployed by the West and what isn't...Sanctions are working and should be tightened. In addition, the West must strengthen and expand NATO. It must not allow the illegal expansion of Putin into sovereign territory. ..Putin managed to put a constructive relationship with the world community back decades by returning his country to the Cold War. ..He thinks the worst of people because he is the worst of people.","There is no doubt that Moscow has been attempting to divide the EU with funding to forward Russia's own interest. &amp; expanded its counteroffensive against western media who like Russia are reporting unverified information (e.g. no smoking gun for Malaysia Airlines Flight 17). If the allegations against Russia could be substantiated in a court of law, a civil lawsuit would be underway. Money, ideology &amp; disinformation are the exact tools of coercion that the United States have always been using..This is exactly why Russia's Putin signed a NGO foreign agents law that prevents foreign countries from influencing the political democratic processes in Russia. As for the United States ideology of 'freeing' or privatizing poor countries markets' through lending requirements of the IMF (they control through veto), subsequently US financiers acquiring them, hence control..The NYT reported so much disinformation (e.g. WMD, Saddam funding Terrorists) released by US government about the Iraq war that it influenced public opinion in favor of war. So many people died in the Iraq war and continue to die today as a result of this unjustified war (e.g. ISIS)..As for Politicians in lucrative positions, the US are the champions (e.g.Politicians turned lobbyists). Republic Reports investigation found that lawmakers increased their salary by 1452 on average from the last year they were in office to the latest publicly available disclosure..<a hrefhttp:goo.gl8gCPCy titlehttp:goo.gl8gCPCy targetblank>http:goo.gl8gCPCy<a>","This would not be the first situation in which President Putins true motivations are rather hard to discern, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. The decision-making process in that country is rather opaque...That's funny. I thought Putin expressed himself quite clearly, as this very article cites: We are supporting the government of Syria in the fight against a terrorist aggression, and we are offering and will continue to offer it necessary military and technical assistance, and we call on other countries to join us ....Why not just take him at his word and go from there?","... President Bashar al-Assad, who has resisted Mr. Obamas demand to step down for years....So let me get this straight, Obama keeps demanding that a President of a sovereign country must step down, and that is Putin who is a bully? Makes perfect sense.","Putin's endgame is very clear. He stated his goal at the very beginning and it never changed since. He wants an unaligned Ukraine which will not be openly hostile to Russia. His preferred method for achieving that is broad autonomy for pro-Russian Eastern part of Ukraine, so that the easterners could veto any anti-Russian turn in Ukraine's foreign policy. Very simple really. And very reasonable too.","I keep hearing this assertion purported by the media that Putin dream is rebuild the soviet empire. I've read most of his books and many articles, and nowhere does he mention expansionist ideals. Furthermore, Russia system is purely capitalistic in nature. These assertions about Soviet ambitions are merely for the purpose of fear mongering.","In fairness, Putin's role as protector of Russian speakers is not self-appointed. He is an elected President of Russia after all.","Putin's goal of attaining Novorossiya, or New Russia, is within his sights. That has the potential to shift the geopolitical and economic power structure of Europe. ..The EU, US and global allies should not be fooled for a second by an announced pullback from Ukraine's border. His agents wear masks and cause mayhem and chaos to obtain an end...Putin has shown himself not to be a reliable partner to Asia or the West. This is the Crimea incursion redux. Russia under Putin only understands force of action and devastating power...Only withering economic sanctions and the steadfast resolve of the global community of nations will change the calculus of further encroachment into sovereign territory."
Guy Walker,,,,"The president said the same thing to Boehner and the congress and they don't talk to him either, so why do you think it is the president's fault Putin will not communicate?  What is it you find in the diplomatic functions between the EU or NATO and Russia delinquent?  Your voice is similar to republican members of congress headed up by Bob Corker who say they want influence, but really don't.  There is a chorus who claim deficiencies in the Oval Office but then are silent (see: health care) as to vocalize a formula to a solution.","You really want the president of the United States to get in the middle of this?  Maybe it has escaped you, but there's a bill due to the EU and with the collusion of Saudi Arabia and the United States oil prices have plummeted leaving Putin without the funds to pay.  The president has conspired with Europe on tactics to deal with Putin.  Don't sell him short.  Tough talk is cheap talk.  Don't fall into that trap.  The president hasn't.","Exactly. Nobody said Putin's rates and terms are reasonable, and that is exactly what this is about.",,,,,,,
Bryan Barrett,,,,"Most certainly President Putin does not now hold all the aces; neither does any other interested party. He did hold an unbeatable hand on Crimea and he was facilitated by the decision of Germany to recognize that fact and ensure that the EU, and NATO, understood exactly the facts on the ground. Whatever the intentions of the US then, as demonstrated by Victoria Nuland and her foul mouthed references to the EU, she has effectively damaged US standing among Europeans; surely she has been removed from the scene by now...So the recognition that Ukraine is broke and is in effect a client state of whichever country or entity decides to finance the shambles that they have created for themselves has finally become a consideration for the US, is definitely progress. The Ukrainian authorities have no options at this point, yet the US continues to attempt to exert influence in an area in which we have no pressing vital interest; it is a European concern; it is in their sphere of influence. It is for the EU to solve along with the Ukraine and Russia...Critically the OSCE will give the European dimension to the crisis that must be successful in order to negotiate a settlement to the matter. The Germans have clearly chosen to put their vital trade with Russia, including the continued supply of natural gas from Gazprom, ahead of any other consideration. Chancellor Merkel is supported by the EU and the 26 European NATO states. The US has no further business in the Ukraine, nor in NATO.","That a century since the war to end all wars began neither the nations involved that August in 1914 nor those which now hold the power to maintain peace or opt for war have yet learned that war is not an option. That the participants in what should amount to no more than a neighbors spat in the Ukraine has the potential for a major catastrophe is daunting. For the US it is a potential tragedy in waiting...That the US became involved in Ukraine in the first place, whether simply to move NATO to the border of Russia, denied of course by our State Department, or for whatever other reason, has now led to President Obama make remarks on the subject of foreign policy on Thursday that illustrate that the US has no strategy on the critical issues of our time, whether in Ukraine, Iraq, Syria or in dealing with the terrorists known as ISSL...As the facts unfolded and President Obama addressed our countrymen  who are mesmerized by events in which we are now immersed and by his admission that we are unprepared to deal with the parallels with August 1914 are uncanny. Nations are stumbling toward potential disaster without having taken the most elementary precaution to consider either the consequences of the actions we took or those which we have neglected to consider in advance...This is a crisis. President Obama admitted to President Putin that the US has no strategy to deal with what amounts to a take it or leave it; who cares the US will not be involved. Has the US ever been so meek?","That in recent weeks the growing disunity in NATO could not be resolved among its 28 members played into the hands of President Putin and likely  emboldened him to do what he had intended to do since he was last Prime Minister of Russia. The spin incorporated into this column, including the title, which is untrue, is a disservice to the readers of the NYT. Unlike a month or two ago when this newspaper was sorely behind the times in its familiarity with the Ukraine and the Crimea, the editors have become quite adept at understanding the facts dealing with this long simmering region, and now reporting accurately. The writers today have a long way to go to catch up...The fence mending being tended to by President Obama is futile; the European public will never discomfort themselves to trade the power of the warmth of Gazprom for any serious action in support of the fractious, coup prone, armed camp of fascist and communist factions which Ukraine is now. A state which has been usurped by the US in a campaign to lessen Russian power in its sphere of influence, as Victoria Nuland famously mentioned in her f... the EU remarks. Many in the EU, and in NATO, were not amused; how does President Obama explain that policy; it is time that Congress investigated...Chancelor Merkel stated her position weeks ago; Russia is a most important trading partner and would remain so. The sanctions are a farce. The Russians have won the Crimea. The EU has its own sphere of influence to attend to.","Having spent some time reading EU area opinions this evening and being aware that Chancellor Merkel has arranged with President Putin to send a Fact Finding Mission to the area and that Secretary of State Kerry is arriving in the Ukraine on Tuesday, the fact that EU citizens are under the illusion that should the Russians fail to do what the EU wants and the crisis deepens, that the US will come to their rescue, comes as a surprise...The fact is that NATO is the force they look to to settle the matter for the EU.

She, the unelected and de facto leader of the EU calls the shots and she has spoken. The French and the British are likely headed in the same direction. That the big three in the EU and in the European membership of NATO are about to seal a deal with Russia is no surprise. The US State Dpt. person who lost her cool on the matter merits serious sanctions. The EU was not amused...Wishful thinking expressed in comments in the NYT recently apropos the EU, NATO and Germany, were a surprise; the facts are now more evident to those people. ..The EU sphere of influence, led by Chancellor Merkel, will work out a deal with Russia, and the Ukraine. Mr Putin still holds all the aces as he has all along; he has achieved his aim and Frau Merkel understands it. The issue has always been Savastopol and its Naval Base, crucial for the Russian Navy and a year round outlet for Russian gas and oil.  ..We should be thankful for peace."
Bob,,,,"Putin and Russia is the real danger to the US and the world. We fret about Iran obtaining the nuclear bomb and at the moment they do not have it. But Russia does and while it might be possible to fight Iran as the President states, we can not fight Russia. No one wins when everything is reduced to ash. He is the real troublemaker and Putin supports Iran as well as Assad. What will happen if NATO is confronted with problems in the Baltic states as Putin has invaded Ukraine with Russian volunteer troops. Iran can cause trouble and they have done so. But do not loose focus because of Iran and ignoring the real threat to the world. Now Putin is causing trouble for EU with Greece and Cyprus. How is he able to do this? We are allowing him to fill the vacuum because of our absence. Putin is the snake in the grass.","I agree with much of this column, but arming the Ukraine would only inflame tensions and bolster Putin at home. And no amount of arms could compensate for the Ukraine's incompetent and weak military. No matter how the West arms the Ukraine, Russia will still have overwhelming military superiority. The bottom line is that the Ukraine means more to Russia than it does to the West, and we cannot risk war with Russia over a nation that is not vitally important to our strategic interests. Let's bolster the defenses of NATO members, but the unfortunate reality is that there's not much we can do to help the Ukraine.","Obama has a choice. He can swallow his pride and welcome Putin actions in bombing ISIS. It will not be easy because of their differences. Or he can follow his own agenda which has been proven to be ineffective in stopping ISIS. Whether we like it or not, Russia is a player. I think Obama needs to listen more to his Secretary of State, John Kerry. We must have a dialogue with Russia and Iran.","This should come as no surprise to anybody following Mr. Putin's tactics. You cannot fault Ms. Merkel for trying, but at some point the EU and NATO will need and make tough decisions that go beyond symbolic additional travel restrictions, lest the Russian leadership becomes further emboldened. Today Mr. Putin complained that the US is now supplying the Ukrainian's with weapons. Whatever the truth, we should deny it.","Putin is the leader of the country that supplies natural gas to Germany and most of Europe. If open war breaks out, if they avoid nuclear war, either Ukraine or the US will blow up those lines. That will bring about a worldwide depression. ..So now you know why the US is building LNG terminals along our Atlantic Coast. ..If you enjoy war, death, hunger and suffering you're in for a treat.","Tired of the propaganda. Putin demands. Perhaps we can back away from inflammatory language and discuss issues, NY Times. What would be wrong with a federation that would insure the rights of ethnic minorities?","So if Putin doesn't have authority to stop the referendum, then you recognize the eastern Ukrainians' independence from Moscow. If that's the case, why won't the West encourage the coup government to negotiate with the eastern Ukrainians? If they're not at the table all pretense of seeking a peaceful solution is lost.","Sometimes the NY Times editorial staff's penchant for middle ground just doesn't apply...carving out a permanent rebel-held enclave in eastern Ukraine is not the greatest of Putin's ambitions in Ukraine, it's the least of them.  The only objective that fits the facts on the ground is regime change in Kiev, a return of the Ukraine to its satellite status of most of the past 200 years.  Putin is empire building, plain and simple.  ..By continuing to characterize the Ukraine conflict as a separatist movement the NY Times is denying the reality of the struggle of Ukrainians to join the community of free, just, and democratic nations.  Opposing this goal are not Russian backed separatists, but separatist backed Russian invaders...So yes, we are entering a dangerous new chapter in the struggle but it is not of the West's making.  The question is whether we are going to support the Ukrainian's right to self-determination and territorial integrity or whether we will allow these people to slip back under the dark cloud of imperialism.  ..This is not Iraq or Afghanistan in the 2000s, it's Kuwait in 1991. The difference is that we need not put American troops in harm's way.  Ukrainians are able and willing to fight to defend their country, if we give them the advanced defensive weapons they need.  ..Let's not dither while brave, good men and women die.  Our support now can persuade Putin that Ukraine will not be a victim of his imperialist ambitions.","Well look at your own Monroe doctrine to see clear parallels here. In 1991 Russia tried rapprochement with the West and even went so far as wanting to join the West. What the West (US, EU) did is reject them and ridiculed them. After the humiliation of bombing of YugoslaviaSerbia, which they saw as a direct slap in their face Putin came to power. The similarities to WW1 are astonishing. In an attempt to humiliate Russia, Austra  Hungary annexed Bosnia in 1908. This was a precursor of what happened later. The saying comes to mind (para phrase) those who do not learn from history are condemmed to repeat it.","Obama has a choice. He can swallow his pride and welcome Putin actions in bombing ISIS.

Boobladoo,,,,"Everything Putin is doing is predictable for any amatuer in geo-strategic relations. ..The question the Times and readers should be posing is, what is the US and EU up to? Why are they acting like this and being such outright provocateurs? This is possibly the most serious situation since the Cuban missile crisis and the leadership are behaving like weird children as the press follow along repeating state propaganda. This was obviously a move that was democratically aggreed upon by the Russian majority in Crimea through a 93 vote by 80 of the population. It was that thing the US always talks about but rare;ly practicesyou know, democratic.","The article begins with a bald falsification: The decision by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to annex Crimea ended the post-Cold War era in Europe. The Crimean population, in a democratic referendum turnout of 80, voted to join Russia by a 93 vote. That's an overwhelming democratic decision by the population, who are mostly Russian. The Russian forces did not invade, they were already stationed in Crimea...The article goes on to say that the we did not win the cold war. ..The cold war was a premise for expanding US corporate and political hegemony throughout the third world. It was used as an excuse to bring democracy to countries whose leadership did not line up with western corporate demands. Look to Latin america and the brutal regimes the US backed there during this period. ..The current falsification of history concerning the cold war is the result of the war on terror no longer being an effective premise for expanding US empire among the population. Washington is using Crimeaa situation spurred by a coup the USEU helped foster in Ukraine by supporting fascist and neo-nazi factionsto create new excuses for imperialism and war. McFaul, a right wing propagandist for the Hoover Institute assists with this article.","Do you consider USEU-backed coup by extremist fascist forces toppling the elected president of Ukraine and releasing old officials convicted of defrauding the government, then appointing oligarchs as regional officials a legitimate setup from which to criticize Putin's reaction and Crimea's majority decision?","Exactly. I have yet to see an article in the Paper of Record questioning why the US would be surprised at Putin's reaction to further military encirclement by the west. They knew well that Putin, who is an formidable strategist, regardless what anyone might think of him otherwise, would not take this lying down.","A search for IMF or International Monetary Fund yeilded nothing. The imposition of the EU economic policies and IMF policies were central to Ukraine interests. Opposition to moving into the EU had to do with the economic heath of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, which have been looted under the current banking structure. Ukraine will be next in line if they enter the EU. ..The rebellions were also joined by certain fascist neo-nazi parties which have a strong presence in the Ukraine government at present. So who will the US and EU support for leading Ukraine under the IMF umbrella of austerity and social looting? Hopefully for the Ukrainians, not the fascist factions. They lead in the violence during the demonstrations and had outside support for arms, medical suport and training. ..And what does this coup, carefully timed to be undertaken during the Olympics, mean for US-Russia relations? How long will Russia put up with military encirclement by the US and its allies? Ukaine will be a perfect launching pad, should military action come up in the future. This is what Putin is thinking about. The US has encircled Russia with nuclear weapons. So people thinking that this is like Egypt or Occupy are being a bit simplistic. This is a major geopolitical move with real implications for relations between an ever more agressive US and Russia.","The article says, The victorious opposition should have known how critical it was to reassure all groups in that country that their rights would be respected in any new order ..The current so-called order was self-installed after a coup. It was formed by far right-wing insurgents, some of which included neo-nazi groups (who have suggested attacking Jews and Russians on top of forbidding Russian). And the self-imposed Kiev government appointed a local oligarch as a Donetsk Region governor, sparking local protests. The current regime has already named several rich oligarchs as leaders. In fact, many local analysts think of the Ukraine protests were orgqanized as an expression of disagreements between oligarch factionsthose who favor the EU and those linked to Russia...Yanukovich, as the elected leader of Ukraine, sent an open letter to Putin asking for military help. Under the influence of Western countries, there are open acts of terror and violence People are being persecuted for language and political reasons. So in this regard I would call on the President of Russia, Mr. Putin, asking him to use the armed forces of the Russian Federation to establish legitimacy, peace, law and order, stability and defending the people of Ukraine...Haven't seen this in the NY Times. ..The idea that the NY Times and the US can call out Putin on international law is pretty rich. The Times was a key promoter of the illegal US invasion of Iraq. Kerry's protest was patent hypocrisy.","The US and EU were partly behind the destabilization of Ukraine. Nuland is on YouTube talking about who will be in and who will be out and that's who is in! She says the US spent 5 billion to influence Ukraine over the last  2 decades. That's a smoking gun and fits the pattern set with the US-manipulated Orange Revolution...So the US and Germany are ratcheting up the rhetoric about actions because Putin has responded to having them set up a fascist puppet regime in Ukraine on the border of Russia. People should question the sanity of such leaders. They've installed a fascist regime in Ukraine and are threatening nuclear-armed Russia and a possible WWIII. And for the fascist Svoboda...Svoboda was condemned in an official resolution voted and adopted by the European Parliament. The document, titled European Parliament of 13 December, 2012 on the Situation in Ukraine, is available online..In section 8 of the resolution, the EUs legislature declares it is concerned about the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine, expressed in support for the Svoboda party, which, as a result, is one of the two new parties to enter the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament...Stating that racist, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic views go against the EUs fundamental values, the EU Parliament therefore appeals to pro-democratic parties in the Verkhovna Rada not to associate with, endorse, or form coalitions with this party...Listen to the tune they and the media whistle now. Madnes.","@ Lil' Old Me..The US has used NGOs to influence the dissident elements in Ukraine. This is what led to the Orange Revolution. One needn';t go to RT to hear Nuland, the videos are posted on YouTube. ..All the info you can get on RT is available elsewhere. But the villification of RT as a propaganda organ for Putin by the unquestioning US media is a bit absurd. In the NY Times I've rarely heard a hint about the Svboda party and its fascist and anti-semetic ties. Why? They have 6 positions high up in the new, coup-installed, unelected regime. ..Isn't it important that Ukraine is the first European country since WWII to have a fascist leadership? And what are the US and EU doing supporting such a regime and using such strident language and actions against a top nuclear power in that support? Do we no represnet a new fascism? And how crazy is it to let things escalate in such a way with the US and Russia? This would have been crazy scary stuff to rational thinking people a copuple of decades ago.","The EU and US offer to Ukraine is and was conditional on taking IMF conditionsimposing massive austerity on the population. Russia offered 15 billion and NO austerity agreement, which is one reason why the elected presidentPresident Yanukovych, not Mr. Yanukovych was leaning toward Russia. The offer was better. All he had to do was look at Greece, Spain, Ireland, to name a few, to see the fate of Ukraine under EU austerity policies...The US knew that Putin would be forced to react this way, considering the military encirclement of Russia that's been going on and the strategic location of Ukraine as a military launch pad. It's the same as North Korea getting friendly with Mexico. Would the US not be forced to respond?..So the real question, since this could threaten nuclear war, is what kind of madmen are engineering our foreign policy? Why threaten nuclear or world war to get Ukraine under EUIMF control?..The NY Times, instead, goes along with the cold-war spin and Pentagon nuthouse narrative. Putin, no matter how repugnant he is, is saner than the US and EU at this point, with their financial world conquest schemes.","@ wahoooo The ologarchs are being installed as leadership by the current, unelected, self-installed regime. Any brief study of the economic results of IMF intervention would reveal it as a tremenduosly negative thing for the country involved and enriching for the financial frauds and exploiters. Look at Latvia, where doctors and lawyers were advised to emigrate and wages were lowered by more than 50 across the board. Would you want to have your living cut in half to meet IMF standards? Greece is a prime example. Read Confessions of an Economic Hit Man by John Perkins who worked in the IMF...@ doug mclarenIt would be treated as an existential threat, as Putin treats Ukraine's coup."
Stas,,,,"By sending warplanes to bomb rebels, including those the United States has tried to shape into some semblance of an opposition, and now by sending in Russian soldiers, Mr. Putin stands to make matters far more complex...If only NYT editorial board used the same logic for both Russia and USA.",,,,,,,,,
john willow,,,,What a humanist that Putin is. He's always willing to take time out from massacring Chechens and others in order to save the lives of Russians - when he's not having Russian journalists who speak out against him murdered.,"Many of the pro-Russian posts here sound like they came straight out of the pages of Pravda. Among the more bizarre claims: The desire of Ukrainians for more ties with the West, where the future lies, is just a plot by Western oil interests, who will subject Ukrainians to repressive austerity measures. Sure. Ukraine has an industrial and technical base with great potential, which is being thwarted by Russian-style old-think and paranoia. When brave Russian soldiers with automatic weapons start shooting unarmed people, you know its the same old same old experienced by Chechnya and Georgia, not to mention Hungarians, Czechoslovakians, etc. When one person here tried to compare a legitimate referendum engineered by the U.S. in Sudan with the transparent farce in Crimea, I could see the parallel reality the creatures of Putin live in. Just seeing the obedient lab rats of the Duma rubber-stamp every aggressive move Putin makes really sums it up. The Soviet Union is back.","Among the many posts here justifying Putin's aggression, I find the one describing the massacre of Muslims by Serbs in Kosovo as ethnic unrest the most offensive. This was another conflict that Russia stuck its filthy hands into. Oh, and how about Syria? Blood for oil and a naval base. Putin is a little Stalin. He only wants buffer states around Russia because any dictator needs to watch his back. And he cares nothing about human life. Put an economic stranglehold on Russia. That will bring it to its knees.","Pussy Riot, journalists, imprisoned businessmen and other Russians living under Putin's disguised dictatorship would likely disagree with the many apologists for Putin posting here. Putin was a faceless apparatchik when  the Yeltsin family anointed him to be Russia's next leader, and power has gone to his head. The false characterization of the popular revolt against Yanukovych as being a coup by fascists is a good example of how Putin's propaganda is reaching even into the comments page here.","It  seems to me it's time for NATO and its allies to start putting a true economic stranglehold on Russia. This would not only put an end to its meddling in Ukraine, but would also weaken its hand in propping up Bashar al-Assad, its straw man in Syria.  We are responsible if we allow the Russian (and Chinese) subsidized slaughter in Syria to go on, and the West will be the loser if the dictator Putin is allowed to surround his oligarchy with puppet states.","Among the many posts here justifying Putin's aggression, I find the one describing the massacre of Muslims by Serbs in Kosovo as ethnic unrest the most offensive.

carla van rijk,,,,"The U.S. appears to have an obsessive fascination with Vladimir Putin teetering on the psychotic. Ukraine is the principal over with two machismo countries, or super-powers, depending on your psychological framework, duke it out on the world stage. Being the last satellite in the former Soviet orbit, Ukraine has always been a corrupt country hobbled along with Russian's charity monies in order to buy influence. Then, the U.S. decides to get involved, according to Putin, and sends the CIA in to rearrange the Ukrainian chemistry in Kiev...Putin is a former KGB agent and is fascinated by everything CIA as a man who wants to know how to do put the genie back in the bottle to save his Russian empire. Some may call it paranoia, others may more aptly classify Putin's state of mind as defending nationalistic boundaries and the classical and distinctive Russian culture from the contamination of Western influence. Putin is not backing down from this power struggle and he refuses to give up his Ukrainian Russian ethnic people in the East who still pledge allegiance to Russia as the motherland. ..The U.S. is placing Western Europe in the awkward position of mediator in order to broker a deal to allow Ukraine to become neutral in the face of outside monied influence. If Merkel and Hollande are successful they will allow the EU to avoid a potential fully engaged war on their doorstep. The U.S. would be wise to hold off on the tough talk and allow diplomacy to reign.","Given Putin's documented history of setting up the Muslim population in Chechnya this latest news event smells of corruption. As we all recall back in September of 1999 there were the Russian apartment bombings in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk which killed 293 and injuring 651 people and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The very next day Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, ordered the air bombing of Grozny, which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War. The facts are that three FSB, KGB equivalent, agents who had planted this device were arrested by the local police. The incident was declared to be a training exercise...How the FSB could plant bombs to stoke Russian public fears and then Putin reacts with an advanced retaliation plan to bomb Dagestan is too blatant to overlook. Coincidentally the so-called leadership by Putin on the apartment bombings served to legitimize the resumption of military activities in Chechnya and bring Vladimir Putin to power by impressing Boris Yeltsin. Anytime that an ex KGB official is running an entire country it is likely that public assassinations of popular political opponents is only par for the course. Of course, once again, Putin pins the blame on the oppressed people of Chechnya which repeats the pattern of increasing his political popularity and indirectly stifling what little opposition is left in his country.","I find it laughable that the US is worried about Putin extended undeserved influence in the Middle East.  President Putin has only one close friend in the region and that is Syria with a long history of good relations between the Syrian people and Russians including intermarriage.  Just as Ukraine has a very close relationship and many Russian speakers and Russianphiles who are the counterpart of Anglo &amp; Francophiles in that they are well read in Russian literature, the arts &amp; music as well as history.  For some reason, the US wanted to mettle in Ukraine and then is (faux) outraged that a great number of Ukrainians remained loyal to Russia.  ..Let's not gloss over the fact that Russia never invaded Iraq and destablized the entire region.  Let's not forget that Russian leaders never embedded themselves with the Princes of Saud like the US Bush family did.  Let's never forget that the British and Americans are responsible, Post WWII, of drawing new artificial geographical boundaries in the Middle East, including displacing large numbers of Palestinians from their homeland, in order to carve out a new Israel, for the suffering &amp; traumatized Post WWII displaced Jews.  Let's not forget that the US &amp; Europe enjoy an alliance the majority of Middle East countries who receive large sums of US military aid including Israel, Egypt, Bahrain, Libya, Jordan, Iraq and Yemen to the tune of 300 billion since WWII &amp; we still cannot seem to buy peace.  Who is sending mixed messages?","I find it amazing that Neo Con war hawks continue to point fingers at President Putin &amp; his threat to the Western NATO alliance while the entire infrastructure of the US continues to unravel &amp; crumble.  Rather than whip up frothy anxiety about Russia's threat to the US, by the way, after over a year of intense &amp; successful peaceful negotiations between Russia, Iran, Europe &amp; the US, why not turn the concern inward about the state of the US.  Instead of wringing hands about whether the former Soviet Baltic states will be swayed back again into the so called evil Russian League of Shadows, why not be concerned about the decaying &amp; crippling state of economic inequality within the 50 US states.  After all, the disparity between rich &amp; poor in most states &amp; big cities within the US resemble far away places like Macedonia &amp; Kazakhstan as far as youth unemployment &amp; lack of opportunities.  If the Republicans have their way in eliminating the EPA &amp; decimating environmental protections, our country will look &amp; smell similar to former Soviet satellites like Azerbaijan which is run by a corrupt oligarch who allows pollution to run rampant as long as the fossil fuel industry continues to pour money into all of the corrupt politician's pockets.  When comparing polluted cities like Sumqayit, Azerbaijan to Gary, Indiana or the air pollution in Bakersfield-Fresno, CA or contaminated filth in Pittsburgh, PA to Chernobyl there seems to be an equivalent threat to civilians lives.",,,,,,
Liberty Lover,,,,"From a totally practical point of view I fail to see what Putin's actions have done for Russia. He has Crimea, which is just a money sink, he has 2 fake republics with tons of his weapons and populations that are half pensioners and dwindling by the day, that can't sustain themselves without money from Russia. He has lost trade with the EU, has lost all levels of cooperation that would benefit Russia in building and diversifying its economy, leaving Russia poorer and more isolated.The EU and US and other allies now regard Russia as a rogue state with nuclear weapons, not to be trusted more than you can throw it...Military provocations have brought NATO back to relevance after it had sunk into a benign relic of the past...Nice going Putin. You screwed up Russia better than any of your imagined enemies ever could have..PS See how many PutinBots you can spot in these comments. They aren't paid very well, but it's the only work they can get right now.","You will notice that all those speaking on behalf of Russia's interests completely disregard and ignore the rights of all those nations finally free from the Soviet yoke to determine their own interests and their own right to collective defense if they so wish. NATO membership is those countries' right as sovereign nations. It is not up to Russia to decide who joins NATO...It is quite amusing that while Putin has put Russia on an increased military budget to enlarge and modernize his armed forces, somehow it is a provocation for those nations next to Russia to provide for their collective defense..Nutty logic.",And how did that work out for Putin? NATO was a forgotten relic of the past and Putin single-handedly has brought it back to relevance and increased importance to the countries bordering Russia. Do you think Putin might be a covert CIA operative?,"Oh and I forgot to mention one other accomplishment of Putin: Reviving NATO as a relevant and more important power. Previous to his shenanigans, NATO was a dwindling Cold War relic, fumbling around for a purpose and direction..Putin has brought NATO back to life as an essential and necessary element of collective security. All hands on deck, battle stations, forward bases, increased funding..Brilliant on Mr. Putin's part I must say.","Putting all the cold war rhetoric aside for the moment, what exactly has Putin gained from his latest  international chess game? A Crimean Peninsula that tourists have abandoned,a motley collection of outlaw gunmen in a bankrupt enclave populated disproportionately beyond productive work years, the enduring enmity of the rest of Ukraine for generations if not forever, economic and diplomatic sanctions that have put the country more into recession that it might otherwise have been, the estrangement of most of the EU nations who will think twice about ever trusting Russia's intentions regarding anything, causing the EU to start considering alternate sources of gas, creating the impression of Russia as a semi rogue state willing to act outside of the foreign policy consensus that has endured in Europe post WWII etc etc...Putin furthers his cult of personality with his countrymen, strengthens his control as an authoritarian ruler who systematically dismantles the infrastructure of a democratic system...Very typical of the tin pot dictator who is willing to destroy his country's future prospects in order to save his  own Kremlin Mafia rule of Fiefdom Russia.","Excellent characterization of what Putin is up to. One small note though. Putin started the takeover of Crimea well before oil prices started plummeting later in the summer of 2014. Russia was plainly outlined its plans at talks concerning Ukraine's attempt to create a trade association deal with the EU. This meeting was in September 2013, before Yanukovych was ousted and when he was actually supporting adoption of the trade deal...The Kremlin aide added that the political and social cost of EU integration could also be high, and allowed for the possibility of separatist movements springing up in the Russian-speaking east and south of Ukraine. He suggested that if Ukraine signed the agreement, Russia would consider the bilateral treaty that delineates the countries' borders to be void..We don't want to use any kind of blackmail. This is a question for the Ukrainian people, said Glazyev. But legally, signing this agreement about association with EU, the Ukrainian government violates the treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia. When this happened, he said, Russia could no longer guarantee Ukraine's status as a state and could possibly intervene if pro-Russian regions of the country appealed directly to Moscow..Signing this treaty will lead to political and social unrest, said the Kremlin aide. The living standard will decline dramatically  there will be chaos..<a hrefhttp:www.theguardian.comworld2013sep22ukraine-european-union-trade-russia titlehttp:www.theguardian.comworld2013sep22ukraine-european-union-trade-russia targetblank>http:www.theguardian.comworld2013sep22ukraine-european-union-trad...<a>","I think it is just the opposite. Putin's good fortune in having oil prices steadily rise during his tenure and therefore the relative increasing prosperity of Russians has given him the political support to indulge some wild eyed bravado in foreign policy and domestic repression. Nobody in Russia seems to care, even with the recession.",Putin will have to accept that the ex Soviet states are gone forever. That's the reality.,"Aww poor little Russia. It had no choice but to interfere in Ukraine, Transnistria and Georgia. It has the largest land mass of any country in the world and is building its armed forces up rapidly despite an anemic economy...Those bully tiny ex Soviet states sitting next to Russia with their tiny armies. How dare they belong to a collective mutual defense alliance?..Trying to defend themselves is definitely anti-Russian. You would think that they would be nice and make it easier for Putin to do to them what he did to Ukraine..NATO is the only thing stopping Putin. And that's why he hates NATO so much.","What is really sad and pathetic is how these fully armed soldiers sauntered into Ukraine without hindrance or challenge. Ukraine's security apparatus must be next to non-existent. Not only that, their security and intelligence agencies are riddled with Russian informers and spies, as Russia and Ukraine were cooperating on these matters, with Russia dominating the process...Ukraine, even before the change in government was teetering on collapse due to its financial condition..Their armed forces are barely functioning and Russia would defeat them in a day if it came to that. That explains Ukraine's reluctance to challenge Russia's takeover of Crimea...Anyone with any sense has understood that Russia uses the FSB, Special Operations forces and local collaborators in a well orchestrated process of disruption and destabilizing to achieve their ends. From the NKVD in the Baltics to the KGB and now the FSB, these are well perfected techniques than span  many decades..Unless the West makes it clear to Putin that Russia will suffer greatly, Putin may do as he wishes.

With the economic rise of many countries, America's loss of credibility due to the lies that led to the Iraq war, and the Great Recession that exposed US massive debt load, the world has decided to largely ignore US...The Germans, French, Japanese, Indians, Saudi Arabians, Australians, Canadians, Brazilians and many other significant countries know that US WILL not come to their aid if they face a conflict.  In the years to come, there will be more regional alliances and more regional economic integration.  ..US President's will be ignored just like Putin ignored Obama's 'warning.'  I believe that is what most Americans want anyway...Enjoy the Oscars!",,
RajeevA,,,,"Putin is ready to talk. So, why not engage him? Realistically, the United States cannot prevent Russia from arming Assad. So, what should we do? Supply the moderate rebels with tanks and artillery to counter the Russian weapons? There will be no end to the madness in Syria as the Civil War would continue for years. Meanwhile, ISIS will kill thousands more and European Union will fall apart under the burden of migrants. If talking to Putin gives us even a hint of a way out of this, let's do it. If we could talk to Stalin when the circumstances demanded it, talking to Putin should not be such a tall order.","If you have nothing of substance to say, Mr. Friedman, you resort to name-calling and vacuous assertions. So you endorse Hillary Clinton's ignorant comparison of Putin and Hitler purely for its shock value. Does it mean that you don't think it's valid? Comparison with Hitler has been a cottage industry since his death and it trivializes his enormous crimes. Putin is no Hitler and never will be. So you think that Putin's actions will make Goebbels blush? Is this statement also for shock value? There is no evil act in the world that would have made Goebbels blush. Your columns on Putin have become boring and predictable. Also, could you please stop using the word thug? Nastiness in columns does not help us solve any problems.","Crimea is part of Russia now. So what? It was before, for hundreds of years. Now the rest of Ukraine can march to its own drummers, be they nationalists, fascists, anti-Semites or of whatever stripes. Apart from so-called, untenable geopolitical interests and Russia-baiting, we have very little to gain by further Putin bashing. Putin is no Hitler. His worldview does not include the twin pillars of anti-semitism and lebensraum. Crimea is of supreme strategic interest to Russia and of no strategic interest to us. It is time our politicians come down from their hypocritical  and moralistic perches and do some real world diplomacy.","Putin and the Pope. There is no premise for a comparison here and Mr. Friedman is well aware of that. Putin bashing is fine, Mr. Friedman, but you don't need to pull the Pope in..This Pope is undeniably progressive but we do not need his or his Bishops' blessings for advancement of gay rights. Events on the ground have overtaken the Catholic Church..The Pope tends to the spiritual needs of his followers but Putin plays in the  arena of real-world geopolitics. He is the leader of the biggest country in the world and rules over a proud, stoic people with a glorious history. As such, he cannot be ignored. To Putin, the expansion of NATO means only one thing- the West is ganging up on Russia..Why should he believe the West's sanctimonious assertions to the contrary? Calling Putin a jerk and a thug is not going to solve any problems. If Mr. Friedman thinks that Western sanctions on Russia will eventually increase disorder in the world, he should call for lifting of the sanctions. There are just too many problems in the world and a new Cold War is the last thing we need. Putin is not the super villain he is made out to be and we in the West are not White Knights either. So let's stop hyperventilating over what Putin is doing or not doing, and start building up a strong and mutually beneficial relationship with Russia.","It's time to get real over Putin. So send defensive weapons to Ukraine now. And, what do we send after Putin escalates? Laser-guided bombs and F-16s? Don't you understand that this road leads to a very dangerous place for both the United States and Russia? Is NATO prepared to engage in an European conflict? Before beating the drums of war, Mr. Cohen, try to think what the end-game here could be. Your blithe dismissal of the risks involved in arming Ukraine is quite preposterous. And Lavrov is not simply dreaming. NATO does want to expand to Russia's borders. Whatever it is, there is no reason for us to corner the bear in his own backyard. The more the United States gets involved, the worse the situation will become. We should let the Europeans handle it. After all, they are the ones who suffered the devastation of two world wars.","So Ukraine's acting President feels helpless. He and his clique should have thought of that before toppling the democratically elected Yanukovych. Now Ukraine is on the brink of Civil War and the enemy is at the gates. What kind of succor does he expect from the US? We cannot expend any more of our limited treasure, to say nothing of precious lives, in propping up or destroying regimes all over the world. We cannot give the Kiev regime the big stick they so ardently wish for, to wave in Putin's face. Turchynov should give serious thought to sending an emissary,( Angela Merkel comes to mind) to Putin's dacha. He might be willing to listen to the better angel of his nature!","If we were waiting for Russia's rebirth in the West's image, Mr. Cohen, then Putin's pivot is not the end of illusions but more like the end of delusions- delusions of grandeur that the West harbors. Why should Russia turn into the poor man's version of the West? You state, Mr. Cohen, that Putin's talk of Russian encirclement is baloney. Is it really? NATO is a military alliance. How will we feel if Canada and Mexico joined a Russian military alliance? Will we ever let that happen? A military alliance that expands to Russia's borders will always be perceived as a direct threat. Putin understands, as well as anyone else, that  the only reason the US hasn't fought a direct war with Russia is the fear of nuclear annihilation.","3 million Ukrainians died during the famine of early 1930s manufactured by Stalin, the Georgian. Then came Hitler's.Einsatzgruppen and Wehrmacht and millions more died. The Red Army suffered terribly while liberating Ukraine from the Nazis. The Russians and the Ukrainians have suffered tragedies together that we in the west can hardly even imagine. They need to find a way out of this mess together. The USA and the neutered EU countries should stand aside..Even Putin will eventually listen to the better angel of his nature.","Vladimir Putin is a delusional thug. Did you predict the fall in oil prices, Mr. Friedman? The emptying of the Russian treasury because of falling oil prices is mostly the doing of Saudi Arabia and not the United States. Putin thought that he could withstand the sanctions, but he did not factor in that the ground would fall from beneath the price of oil. But neither did anyone else. So if you want to call him a thug, its your prerogative, but he was certainly not delusional. Though you deny it, your schadenfreude comes across quite clearly in this piece. Your personal animosity towards Putin does too. No matter what we think of him personally, he is the elected leader of Russia and we have to deal with him till the Russians themselves decide to throw him out. Diplomacy has to be continued on both sides till some common ground is found. Believe me, a Russia with its economy in free fall would cause repercussions far beyond its borders. The outcome could be a dangerously unstable world, compared with which our current world, beset as it is with religious extremism, terrorism, racism and poverty, would look like the Garden of Eden.","3 million Ukrainians died during the famine of early 1930s manufactured by Stalin, the Georgian.

Ron,,,,The war in the Ukraine is the result of failure by NATO (mostly European nations) to immediately confront Russian aggression. I am so reminded of Hitler's move into Poland and the lack of a BritishFrench response. Putin is not to be trusted in anything he says.  NATO should be sending massive amounts of weapons and other military equipment to the Ukraine along with military advisors to help coordinate Ukraining defenses and make it clear to Putin that if he wants a fight he will get one. I suspect he would back down immediately. Those in eastern Ukraine who are sympathetic to the Russian view should be allowed to immigrate back to Russia without reprisal but if they stay they must accept being citizens of Ukraine.,"I guess if you look at the grand chessboard, Putin is winning Syria, Iran and Iraq and arming them to the teeth and keeping the US busy, while China has built its third landing strip in the SCS. The China-Russia-Iran axis is unfolding right before our eyes. Choke Europe from any access to oil from the Middle East Both sides are trying to gain as many allies as possible before the inevitable happens. This coming war is all about who survives, not who wins.","Two things... NATO has no business here, no alliance with Ukraine, so stop urging NATO to get involved. Secondly, It sure sounds to me like the Ukraine is a gutless country They give up their government installations and an armored column without a shot. Why wouldn't Putin target such an easy country to take over?","Where is Angela Merkel? She was the one pushing everyone to let Russia in on the quagmire saying, There could not be peace without Russia being involved. It's a no wonder why she was being spied on. This woman scares me and should be watched at all times. She is too close to Putin and they are both Communists.","This is not a U.S. problem. This is a European problem. Obama's strategy by not going to Syria to bomb ISIS yet, is a good one. The longer the US waits, the more likely surrounding countries will have to come together and act. The same should be with Ukraine. It's up to the EU to make their move and we will follow. This is part of Putin's plan, to try and keep the US busy with ISIS so he can invade Ukraine. I'm glad Obama isn't playing his game.","So the Separatists are defiant against Putin, really? Some big game Putin is playing. So the Russians go in Ukraine and supposedly deal with the defiant Separatists and then never leave Eastern Ukraine and then claim it. I hope the West doesn't fall for this one.","So the Separatists are defiant against Putin, really? Some big game Putin is playing.

Vizitei Yuri,,,,"This actions is long overdue. US has stood by and ignored Russian aggression in Georgia, Moldova, Ossetia, Abkhazia, and now Ukraine. This doesnt involve direct threats against Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Anyone who keeps claiming that Russia threatens no one, is either working in Kremlin's propaganda department, or is simply uninformed. The West has cowered as Putin has used aggression to stir up Russian imperial nostalgia. He must be confronted economically and militarily. Alas, this dire need arises with the most action-averse occupant of the White house. Which likely has a whole lot to do with putin's willingness to annex Crimea and attack Eastern Ukraine.","Once again, Mr. Obama is left looking confused and outmaneuvered. Once again he is left reacting to events rather than anticipating them and taking proactive steps to keep the adversaries off-balance. Putin's strategy is very simple - generate an illusion of fighting ISIS (as many comments here indicate he accomplished that), protect his military interests in the middle east (check), divert attention from Ukraine (find anywhere in today's paper anything about a war started by Russia in the middle of Europe). Methods which worked on organizing community action in Chicago, do not work on the World's political stage.","Once again, Mr. Obama is left looking confused and outmaneuvered.

To assume that this man all of a sudden obtained something like a heart or integrity would be to ignore prior evidence of Crimea, Georgia, Moldova, Chechnya, or Ossetia. The  fate of children didn't concern  him much in Beslan either. EU should provide the required aid, and the aid from Russia should be used for the Russians who will need it once the full effect of Putin's decisions becomes evident.",blasmaic - it's NOTHNG by Putin's standards.,I am afraid that having Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry in charge of dealing with Putin is like bringing a teleprompter to a gunfight. They are simply overmatched and discredited by the prior red lines. We are paying the price for the collective feel good over the election of the unqualified president. On the other hand he is a good looking guy and plays great basketball.,"I read a lot of hopeful posts here. I don't buy it Putin has nothing to gain from it at the moment. He is better of with continued instability. Unless Obama gave him a carrot of some sorts, it is simply a tactical move to take a bit of pressure off. more instructive is to read his interview with the common people where he never referred to the region as Ukrain but rather kept calling it by its ancient name - Novorussiya - new-Russia. He also offered extensive justification for the armed incursion that sounded eerily familiar with his words on Crimea. He also admitted to the green men being the Russian commandos. None of these are encouraging signs.","I am mildly amused at people having no clue repeating the mantra about Cirmeans wanting to be with Russia and we should not interfere. It demonstrates that if you repeat it often enough, people will start siting it as the truth. Here is the truth: The people of crimea are of varying nationalities. Majority are Russian speakers. A huge portion of the population are pensioners. Putin in a manner well familiar to a KGB hack mounted of campaign of lies - US military is taking over Ukraine, Fashists are coming from Kiev to massacre Russians, etc. etc. Once everyone was sufficiently scared, he announced that all pensions would be tripled if Russia took over (making Crimean pensioners take four times of a Russian pensioner living across the border, and then to intimidate any possible opposition he landed thousands of unmarked troops who took control of every official building, press, and voting centers. Is this what one would call people voting feely? If you would simply apply some common sense and think - would you rather be with a country that's on track to be a part of EU or a backwater to a country with no future, petro-economy, one of the worst corruption index in the world, and one that's in an advance state of enforcing a total authoritarian system and a cult of personality ? Well ? whi9ch one would YOU chose?","People who wonder how it could happen, underestimate the closeness of Russians and Ukrainians and the nature of the former Soviet Union where a Russian speaker can naturally live and be present anywhere in the former USSR borders without arousing suspicion. Clearly this would be much harder to pull off with , lets' say Japan or Germany. So this warfare style is custom made for the former Soviet territories and has become Putin's favorite play thing. The former KGB hack is finding it very musing, but the west should make him pay a heavy financial price for his subterfuge.","Putin is an excellent tactician but poor strategist. He has painted himself into a corner and in a manner that was entirely predictable. He got his bounce in opinion from the servile, soviet trained population. However, economic recession and international isolation will ultimately spell a disaster. Students of history in the future will be amazed that a thug, a criminal and a thief managed to accomplish this with a country that occupies 20 of the world's land mass. It is a testament to the fact that great Soviet crash still reverberates. For without its conditioning, the people would have never allowed it."
Rob,,,,"Putin and Assad should be left to deal with ISIS.  Let's see how they do.  The fact that the West can't seem to get their act together in the ME is what is causing more destabilization.  Whether it's our not knowing who to back or Europe allowing in fettered immigration by economic migrants, the fact is allowing Russia and Assad to deal with it might actually be a very good thing. ..We insist that the culture of democracy is something that can be imported and planted in other parts of the world and it will be embraced and grow.  Well much of the ME isn't a desert for a reason.  Our western values and system of government will not grow there the way we would like it.   Perhaps harsh dictatorships are what these people can only live and prosper peaceable under.  It seems that one tyrant is replaced by another from a rival religious group.  While Assad is bad, I'm guessing the Syrian people believe this civil war is worse.  And he was pretty secular in the way people could live in Syria...The West needs to stop nation building in an area that is still primarily tribal with in instances a dictator to keep all the factions in line.  We need to trade with them, we need to figure out how to live next to them, but not amongst them...Good luck to Putin is all I can say.  I guess the Russians want a second chance after their Vietnam...Afghanistan!","Putin is smart and knows where he can make make his moves.  That's why I don't think it's possible for him to invade a country such as Poland.  It would be the start of WWIII, and I truly don't believe Putin wants that due to the fact that the negative would far outweigh the positive for Russia. (and the rest of the world)  By going into Ukraine, he pushed Russian's limits and got slapped in the wrist.  At this point, Europe and the US are dancing with Russia in modern war games.  In a grand scale, the current political posturing seems comical due to the fact that sending a few tanks means nothing when you're talking about super powers with nukes.  ..At the end of the day, Europe wants Russia's gas, and Russia wants to make money by selling its gas to Europe.  It would be a bad business move for Russia to further anger one of it's best clients.  Therefore, in the end...  we are witnessing the leaders of the world's most powerful countries acting like 7th graders playing with G.I Joe's.  Unfortunately, since this is the real world and not the realm of plastic tanks, there are people whose real lives are affected by this.","This is when world events start taking on the qualities of bad Orwellian satire. Does Putin or the usual suspects who drop their daily Russian party-line doctrine in these comments realize how ridiculous and tacky this convoy thing is? You'd almost think it's a joke, except real people are dying...I highly doubt it's a true Trojan Horse as so many commenters have said. Seems like an oddly clumsy way to invade especially after the slickly choreographed &amp; denial-heavy strong arming of Crimea. More likely it's a propaganda event for domestic consumption (in which case Putin doesn't care how sleazy it looks to the rest of the world) and if possible to get demonstrable Russian aid workers on the ground to give the separatists some breathing room - a corridor for their leaders to escape, and to prevent them from being completely overrun. And if the Ukrainians accidentally shell some aid workers, then the tanks can roll across the border, with justification for domestic use even if internationally no one's buying it...I'm not going to get into all the Russian actions and policies since Feb 2014 that have directly created this humanitarian catastrophe - because again, the best way to ruin a joke is to have to explain what makes it work. Either you get it or you don't.","Again, the irony is ridiculous. We want the people of Ukraine to live in peace, unfortunately Putin's been making it very difficult for them at the moment. If Russia truly wanted to help, they'd disavow any support for the armed separatists and call for them to set down their weapons, seal the border, stop sending over (or allowing to be sent with the requisite denial) material support, and here's the kicker...... Give Back Crimea...Simple as that. The violence would stop and Ukraine could start stitching itself back together again. But you guys come in here with your loaded appeals to the lives of mothers, fathers, sons, daughters loved ones, when Russia's been the one fomenting this disaster all along.... do you realize how absurd it sounds?","Yes Putin actually has a plan which is to bolster Assad and bring order back to the country.  Obama says Assad must go, but as usual has no idea how this might be achieved.  Maybe more weak whiny speeches at the UN? Or a new red line to step back from once it's crossed?  I would suggest a golf match or a game of HORSE, things the President seems to at least have a chance of winning. Certainly lobbing a few bombs at ISIS, and arming moderates (they can't seem to find any) has achieved nothing.  Putin may not succeed immediately, but he is correct that there is no other path to stability in Syria. It is laughable that Obama calls for regime change after blaming the Iraq war for destabilizing Iraq by removing Saddam Hussein.  My recollection is that Hussein was also a dictator that attacked his own people, but we are told over and over that we should have left him in power. How is Assad different?","The development of this crisis from the Russian side has been pretty fascinating...The covert seizure of Crimea, and then this slow-burn invasion of Ukraine where Putin escalates inch-by-inch - toeing each new progressive step and holding there just long enough for the West to get used to it, then ramping up pressure when the time is right. It should be noted all the major escalations happen parallel to Russian diplomatic overtures. Combined with a combination of plausible deniability and bald-faced lies, disinformation including armies of pro-Russia internet trolls and fairly savvy TV productions, constant You do it too! false equivalencies, cultivation of Useful Idiots, the list goes on. It's been brilliantly conducted in a repulsive sort of way...Opposing Russia is an international group that makes decisions in part by consensus and has no appetite for conflict. It's no contest really. I don't think this is going to end well for Ukraine in the short term, and in the long term we'll have protracted tensions and probably a fracturing of the EU alliance - no one will truly benefit, not the West and not Russia either...Never underestimate the power of revanchism and the collective cultural insecurity that fuels it - despite countless bloody examples through history to learn from, we never seem to.","Well said Steve - my initial thought was that Ukraine is a serious crossroads for 21st century Europe, but you make a good point about the Balkans. Europe already failed there in a sense...I should note that the Russia of today is not the Soviet Union. No matter how much nationalist pride &amp; fervor might be cresting amongst its people and politicians, it is much much diminished from that era. I have a suspicion that if the EU &amp; USA can maintain (and probably escalate) serious sanctions against Russia, that eventually Putin &amp; Co will be put in a very difficult spot. While I wouldn't go so far as to say Russia's a paper bear, they're probably far more vulnerable than is generally thought. It's not outside the realm of possibility that the West can succeed with this soft power and come out of it more determined and focused than beforehand. We'll see.","Here's what I'd love to see - all the pro-Putin Novorossiya folks here (quite a few today), both trolls and True Believers, pinky swear to stop by again in 5 or so years when this whole Ukraine debacle has been ultimately judged as an expensive &amp; immoral mistake that damaged Russia economically, diplomatically, and politically in the long-term, and Putin is spoken about by Russians in the same derisive tones as an overreaching nationalist failure as GW Bush is by most Americans...Come back then when the consequences have been made clear, and personally own all the nationalistic distortions and delirious proclamations of Russia's righteousness you've been making lately, that will end up looking spurious and misguided in hindsight. Because that's how situations like this usually work out in the end - unfortunately you guys are blinded to the lessons of history because your egos are invested in this thing (or you're getting paid to shill for Putin)...In the modern world with its short attention spans there's a tendency to over-emphasize events in the here-and-now, to assume they'll be the dynamic going forward. But if history's any guide, the path Russia's treading will probably not have a positive outcome for them - the signs are there already...Again guys, come back in 2019 (or hey, even 2017, I'll give it 3 years) and crow about Putin's righteousness and the glory of Novorossiya, see how it sounds then. My prediction is, not so great.","I do have to say, some of the comments below implying that this convoy is actually carrying military supplies for the separatists are a little silly. That's not Putin's game here. It's most likely a propaganda event for domestic consumption. But the primary gambit would be depending on how negotiations go while it's en route - if they can get the supplies delivered to their destinations (Donetsk, Luhansk) using Russian personnel and vehicles, they get some convenient human shields to force Ukraine to stop their offensive against the rebels or risk the real invasion forces pouring across the eastern border. In that sense it's a ploy to save the separatists from being completely overrun - which seemed to be inevitable otherwise - and help them retain some pockets of power (and thereby avoid capture of their leaders, possibly helping them escape?)...The above is all speculation of course, but that seems to be the approximate plan considering all we know at this point. Hopefully the Red Cross and the international community are able to coordinate control of these supplies before the Russians roll over the border, so they can be distributed by a country other than Ukraine's antagonist.","I'm skeptical about comments here ready to surrender any part of Ukraine to Russia. The election that concluded with 97 of the voters wishing to secede from Ukraine? What about the 40 of Crimea that is NOT ethnically Russian? ..Today's Times, on its front page, reports that virtually everyone sees the hypocrisy behind Putin's rhetoric and actions. Based on what I read in these comments, people the world over - or at least throughout the US - see Obama as weak and Putin holding all the cards. It is as if the US is to blame for Russia's moving its troops to the edge of Ukraine. One commentator is ceding further countries of Europe to Russia, just in case. ..The old USSR built its economy in the 1930s while much of the Western world suffered depression. The old USSR had some appeal to developing nations who wanted to industrialize and rise quickly out of poverty. But after the 1960s, the old USSR as only ever a superpower when it came to the arms race. One of the world's richest nations in grain wound up importing grain by the 1980s. It was one thing that the USSR couldn't exert any power in Afghanistan, but ten years after it entered Afghanistan, it couldn't even keep Latvia in its orbit. ..Who are these people waving the flag of the USSR, painting themselves red, chanting for Putin and calling on Soviet symbols and rhetoric? ..And who are these readers that think that Russia, without the aid of a 6 year World War to devastate Europe, could be a serious threat to Europe?"

It's easy to make grandiose pronouncements from behind a safe, comfortable desk. The Situation in Ukraine is much more complex than your superficial, feel-good remarks would have us believe. Do you have any idea of the complexities that exist in Ukraine and in its neighboring states? Are you not aware of the oligarchs in Ukraine with their shifting loyalties, some for Putin and some against, and how those loyalties can change depending on where the gas, candy, or money is flowing. Your continued use of paragraphs full of lofty statements and black or white end games show you possess a superficial, at best, understanding of what the consequences of a Ukraine aligned with the E.U. as opposed to being non-aligned would be for the people living there.

The chickenhawks and warmongers  would be happy to do the same again over the Crimea. Mr. Friedman's op-ed is an excellent analysis of Putin and of the neocons. The reasonable suggestion of increasing the tax on gasoline a few more cents would most certainly send the hawks in Congress into a crazed frenzy.

Bruce Olson,,,,"Well said by both Larsvaness and Alex. Almost no Americans know anything abut Russia or its people and what they think they know is wrong in most cases.  Putin is popular in an environment where, believe it or not, there is an internet and yes, even some objective TV and access to the world's newspapers. Like it or not in the West, he has been good for Russia...I spent some time in Novosibirsk Russia, third largest city and called the Gateway to Siberia, a ways north of Afghanistan. Sadly, less than 12 of 1  of Americans even know it exists with its subways. parks, heavy industry, universities and unique history during WWII. ..I was there in Aug 2001 when Putin was just taking control for the first time. There was real hope expressed over many a dinner and many a vodka toast because of the economic and bureaucratic mess since the fall of communism...What I saw was a people as loyal to Russia as Americans  will ever be to America. That month before 911 an Afghanistan vet of the 80s told this Vietnam Vet of the 60s that Afghanistan was Russia's Vietnam, just as bad and both Russia and America had both paid a needless stupid price...Russians think of Eastern Europe like we think of Latin America and the Caribbean. Putin has made real progress with the economy and with restoring the pride and hopes of Russia. He may be a bully to us but he is a hero to them and he is not crazy. His nation will follow him when it comes to Eastern Europe.  It is their backyard, NATO or no NATO.","It has been 70 years since WWII.  It has been 25 years since the end of the Cold War. It has been 1000 years since Russia has had any reason to feel secure within its own borders from the aggression of others, mainly European and Western Threats including Napoleon and Hitler...Fact of geography and economics: Eastern Europe whether in NATO or not is to Russia what Latin America is to the United States...Fact of reality: Russia is now dependent on selling, not getting its oil in  Europe whether Putin, Europe or our US Pentagon admits or not...Fact: NATO was set up when Europe was down and out and Russia and the United States were the two gorillas left standing with Western Europe caught in the middle. It made sense for a NATO especially since most Americans  had their roots in Europe, much like so many today in Crimea and Ukraine with roots in Russia...Fact: Eurozone Europe is now as economically muscular as the United States when taken as a whole.  ..Question: Why is the US even thinking of doing what Europe should do if they think this Putin threat is real. Eurozone is a big boy now, not down and out...Putin says: I think that only an insane person and only in a dream can imagine that Russia would suddenly attack NATO, ..I think he is right. He may be an egotistical and seem a bully, but he is not insane...at least not yet.  ..Ever hear of the Monroe Doctrine? Putin is doing in his backyard what we repeatedly have done here. It is not unexpected and not worth a US buildup.","On the surface good news!!! Our weak president seems to again be stronger than the loyal opposition will ever admit.  ..It's even better that Kerry will speak for the United States and not some neocon idiot like John Bolton, Bomb Bomb Iran John McCain or any other Secretary of State picked by Romney were he our President;...but then, thankfully, he's not.    ..Bin Laden is dead, Khadafy is dead, chemical weapons are coming out of Syria.  We have no troops on the ground in Iraq. We will soon be out of Afghanistan one way or the other. ..In spite of the tragedy in Benghazi and Issa's Congressional witch hunt, things could be much worse, even in Egypt. Putin's moves in his own backyard have come as no surprise to anyone, given the circumstances in Ukraine. Maybe his action was not the right thing to do by our rhetoric and democratic ideals but I doubt that any US President, Republican or Democrat, faced with a similar situation in our own backyard would react much differently, based on our invasion and actions in Panama in 1989.   ..We need to support our President and Secretary Kerry as they maneuver in these uncharted waters.  If will be interesting to see if the GOP tries to swift boat Kerry and Obama for their own political reasons. They have done it before.  They are likely to do it again. This ol Vietnam vet hopes not.","Why are we obsessing over this?  Do we have the power, the will or even the moral authority to anything more than we are already doing as a nation?..Just what is our endgame?..Like it or not, this is a lose lose for the U.S.. I find nothing in the Preamble of our Constitution that can justify anything more than our government's use  diplomatic influence. To do anything more:.does nothing to make ours a more perfect Union,.threatens rather than insures our own domestic Tranquility,.weakens rather than strengthens our common defence,.does nothing to promote the general Welfare of the American people,.makes less secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,..Color me isolationist if you want but this Vietnam Vet says that part of the world is not our responsibility except for when events there actually threaten the United States and its people. Ukraine's internal politics and historic strategic relationship and tension with Russia is not our responsibility just as Vietnam should not have been nor should the second Iraq War. ..Afghanistan yes, Ben Laden was overtly at war with us, and the Taliban gave him their support...Japan, Germany before WWII, yes they were openly threatening to us and our allies in both Europe and China. ..North Korea, yes, they invaded an ally and we went in with the UN's concurrence. ..Granada no, Panama, maybe. ..Ukraine? No, at least not until they or Putin makes the situation a clear threat to our own security.","Change the country from Russia to the United States, the word autocracy to plutocracy, the name Republican leadership in place of the name Putin and the Russian authors with another Russian born thinker, Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum, later renamed Ayn Rand. Then change the religion reference from Orthodox to Christian and Brooks may have just explained the conduct of our own GOP leadership...John McCain seems to want to play power politics as part of a great American foreign mission...Paul Ryan loves Ayn Rand and wants everyone to read her work...Brooks might just as well be describing the leaders of America's Republican Party. Consider the following paraphrase to what he writes:..Three great ideas run through this work. The first is American exceptionalism: the idea that America has its own unique spiritual status and purpose. The second is devotion to the Christian faith. The third is belief in plutocracy.

I think Brooks may be wrong about Putin. I hope I am wrong about our own GOP.

It must not be a big enough deal to spill American Blood over. Case closed for the military option. That said, we all need to get behind this administration in a non-shooting effort to promote some acceptable closure...This Vietnam Vet (yes a volunteer motivated by the passing of my draft physical) believes this is to Putin what the invasion of Panama was to the United States in 1989.  ..We were likely wrong then in how we went about doing it just as Putin is likely wrong now about how he is going about it.  However, the bottom line is, it is Putin's backyard dealing with things as important to him as the Canal is to America. In this case its a warm water naval base, his only one in the West, and oil &amp; gas pipelines instead of ships.  Like our Canal, the unstable situation in Ukraine is real to him, both militarily  and in terms of trade (stuff in pipes instead of ships.)..We called our invasion Operation Just Cause How quaint. I wonder what he calls his?..We made sure we got the Panamanian government we wanted but it is still Panama today and not a territory or part of the United States as it once was historically...I believe that Putin will do essentially the same thing in Ukraine. We set the precedent in Panama whether we want to admit it or not. And as with us, it is in his best interest to do so.",,,

Citixen,,,,"While the old Soviet Union was a cult of ideology, Putin's is a cult of personality.  It has no real staying power beyond him.  Unlike Stalin, he has not done the equivalent of industrializing an agrarian nation out of the Middle Ages.  The flag-waving nationalism is a known product of diminishing returns, while a nation of special-ops thugs have a country crumbling behind them.  He can't build up his military much beyond what China is willing to sell or donate as hand-me-downs (at least until the successor of Jin Jinping reassesses the 'alliance')  Wait him out if we can, tighten the screws if we must.  Its a return to the Cold War, but in miniature.  This too shall pass.","They want to live in Donbas with Russian values and we should figure out how to let that happen if we really want to end the war...You make a good point.  But if it were that simple it would've happened already.  You need to understand that what Ukrainians and even Russians want is beside the point as far as Putin is concerned.  His eye is on the future and the extent to which that future relies on the primacy of the state.  Putin is playing a larger game in his eyes.  The lack of a resolution to the Ukrainian problem suits his larger purposes, tying down the attention of the West and providing a convenient propaganda platform (which the West is currently, woefully inadequate in countering) for his domestic audience, which he will need when it comes time for him to amend the Russian constitution to allow him to run for a fourth term (third as president) in two years.  Get ready for provocations from Moscow.","@barryschreibman.Good comment.  But I think you're a bit too sanguine about the lack of staying power of Putin's eastward tack.  Partly, it's a question of time; the longer Putin remains in power, the deeper his 'reforms' will take root.  In addition, don't discount the power of the ROC (Russian Orthodox Church) to see its future in support of Putinism.  Unfortunately, the ROC spent too many decades under strict party control when the soviets were in power for much independence from the state to have developed.  Barring the rise within that institution of Dietrich Bonhoeffer-like individuals willing to publicly make a stand against the state, something not likely to happen given the strict hierarchical histories of both church and state, I don't expect much there either...However, the West still has cards to play, particularly with leveraging its relationship with China.  Russia needs China much more than China needs Russia.  That is Putin's Achilles heel.  However, much depends on the US getting its political house in order, to play the long game with its allies effectively.  That's going to be as much of a lift as countering Putinism.","I'm not sure I buy into Putin's alleged 'fear of a lack of state power' to excuse his actions both domestically and abroad.  He is, however, an opportunist par excellence.  Doesn't anyone feel that he noticed the headache being given to an EU struggling with a mass influx of refugees this summer, and said Aha, I know how we can make life miserable for Europe! Maybe they'll sing a different tune about Ukraine and Crimea, when they have more immediate concerns crossing their own borders?  Thus, a policy for stirring the hornets nest in Syria was born.  A twofer that just might also help a beleaguered ally in Syria's president Assad, and reestablish Russia as a Middle East player...But 'uprisings studied by Russia's millitary commanders' as a 'new USEU approach' to warfare?  Hardly.  Such 'studies' stand as fig leaves behind which a KGB mentality exercises its cynical manipulations of diversions and covert activity to achieve goals in places where the world's eyes aren't looking.","I should also mention that a Ukrainian colleague of mine, who speaks regularly with folks back home and in Russia, says we shouldn't trust the poll numbers too much.  As during Soviet times, they say one thing to pollsters and another thing around the kitchen table.  While she knows some who support Putin, many do not, but they will not just say that over the phone or internet connection.  With the heavy hand of the state, its just easier to live two lives, one public, the other private.  I'm sure Putin has much of Russia behind him for now, but as time passes, and their lot doesn't improve (and with their kleptocracy, why should it?) that will change.","@Mark Thomason.While there may have been 'war games' on the shelf for Crimea (considering those naval bases), don't forget that this all started because Putin wanted Yanukovych to sign an economic deal.  I don't think he expected his stooge to be deposed.  Therefore the Crimean incursion seems very much to a seat-of-the-pants decision, and likely because he understood his own standing in Russia (such as it is) would not survive sitting back and just taking the loss.  So, no, I don't think the Crimean takeover was the playing out 'of a long series of events', unless you want to consider that Crimea is happening out of turn with respect to whatever playbook Putin is reading from.  I may have ultimately been his goal, but not now and not this way.  On the other hand, Putin certainly knows his opportunities when he sees them.","Well, this 'minimally informed' citizen, who has been following this story since its beginning last November on the basis of an economic deal Putin wanted signed by Yanukovych, isn't going to be 'taken in' by your kind of claptrap 'analysis'.  I saw the same events you did, but our conclusions are diametrically opposed.","What 'expansion' are you talking about pre-Crimea and pre-Ukraine?  Russia was invited and a member of all the major global finance and economic organizations, even when its numbers didn't always match its prestige.  The world felt it had a duty to include the world's largest nation on its councils.  A quiescent NATO hadn't done a bloody thing to Russia.  The EU, with its own problems, actively discouraged membership overtures by many FSU's.  But none of that mattered to Putin.  Instead of adjusting his business plan by using the bear's honey and planning for a future in a global community, he became a predatory takeover artist who didn't care what people on the ground wanted.  Putin knew what Putin wanted.  So Putin took Crimea, and tried to destabilize and take Ukraine as tries to sell it as preventing Western encroachment(!) as if the West were suddenly Russia's mortal enemy.  That necessitated a response from the West.  Now, Russia has lost most of its Western friends and lost much of its prestige on the world stage and in its councils.  A smart leader would've expected such chess moves.  Instead, Putin seems to be improvising, with the Russian people suffering the consequences.  To be frank, he appears to have a Napoleon-complex.","Oh, Russians are resilient alright, but sometimes resilient for all the wrong reasons.  Putin is just a guy who's taking advantage of that.","Not having Europe solidly on his petro hook?  You'd better believe he considers it a defeat.  Perhaps not a commercial one, in the short term, but definitely a strategic one, from the point of view of petro diplomacy.  Of course, he's not going to come out and admit it, he's spinning this in his favor for all its worth.  But we don't have to take his word for it, we have our own far more objective metrics to make a judgement on whether this is a win or a loss for him, and on what basis...And so what if Mr. Way claims Putin is much beloved.  I know as many Russians as Mr. Way probably does, and according to them the talk around the kitchen table (as opposed to self-identified Western reporters) is far more skeptical than the polls would suggest.  And anyway, popularity is often transient and decoupled, if temporarily, from other performance metrics.  Russians badly needed a 'hero', and Putin could read that as well as anybody by 2010, so it wasn't hard to appear to step into those shoes...When I think of Putin's popularity, I often think of GWB's sky-high popularity after 911 and right through to the end of 2003 when the failures of policy and the lie that got us back into a Middle Eastern ground war for no good reason were too obvious to ignore.  By 2004, the GOP had to play dirty in order to win him reelection...If oil prices continue to stagnate, Putin's petro regime will be nearly bankrupt in two years.  Lets see what his poll numbers look like then."
Robert,,,,"You do realize that your on argument undermines your main point.  You argue that its not Putin, he just represents the actual prejudices of Russian themselves and their desire for military action.  This is not an incentive to negotiate with Putin, just the opposite.  Does your actual argument not call for a harder and more realistic line toward Russia.  Why will no pro-Western democratic leader be elected in Russia, you yourself state its because of the inherent beliefs of the population and has nothing to do with Putin or our policies toward him.","Yes, what is wrong with a Federation that protects the rights of the minorities???  I am glad to see an alert reader demanding that Putin actually implement a Federation in Russia and give minorities real rights there. Since January 1, the Russian military and special forces have killed more than 80 Russian citizens in anti-terrorism operations in the Caucasus. Thank god posters are starting to stand up for them.","As usual Putin is using some kind of twisted logic to justify his actions. The thing to be aware of is Putin's psychology. Putin is a narcissist and as such he will satisfy his defiance everytime. If you say no to Putin, like any narcissist he is going to rebel and go the opposite way.  This makes Putin a dangerous player on the world stage.","Russia has no international presence beyond its incursions into contiguous countries.  This strategy is a low-risk demonstration whose probability of success is not really the issue.  It puts Russia into the international arena again.  If it fails, Putin can pull back at any time and blame it on the other countries that are focused on ISIS.  If it succeeds - a small probability, as even Putin cannot control Assad - Russia can use it as an excuse for demanding more international airplay.  It is a perfect example of trying to play an entire chess game with pawns.",Widely available sources have been publishing for more than a week that Putin demanded 10 days till the start of the cease-fire while Ukraine wanted it to start immediately.  This article suggesting something different seems to be part of the course for coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,"Russia has no international presence beyond its incursions into contiguous countries.

Why no intervention in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain? Or why not in Egypt for that matter? Because those governments work with us. In Egypt the status quo is back. Order is back because the USA did not interfere. Putin's point is validated. See, is not a question of good versus evil. Iraq was a mistake. Libia was a mistake. Do we really need another?","Thanks a lot, Mr. Cohen! First time I read your opinion with the great interest and it was objective and very logical. You are absolutely correct. Creating mafia-like structure in his country, where are not law, independent court or press, but people with different opinions are placed in the prison, killed or beaten on the streets and so on, Putin uses the same mafia approach in international affairs. He needs respect, because he is a godfather. He has to be stopped. We have to respect Ukrainian people because their fight shows well who are in Kremlin. It was enough for us Georgia in 2008. We watched it. We got Ukraine...I watched on Youtube, when Putin announced of Crimea's   annexation to the members of his Duma, I heard the people in Duma asked (I knew Russian) what would be next: Alaska....? Ms. Merkel is wrong. If not now, when? If now we, who? Thank you, Mr. Cohen, for the very interesting and right comments.","If only this wise advice had been there in 1939, we could have avoided the entire 2nd world war.

Neil,,,,"Another grand failure of the Obama administration. Not so much that Putin got what he wanted, but what did we get? Concessions on Iran? On Snowdon? Nothing.","We need to show Russia that we are unafraid of another Cold War, or even a hot one. We beat them at this game before, and we can do so again. We should deploy 500,000 solders to Poland over the next several months, and resume combat patrols up to the Russian boarder. Clearly, Putin can not be contained, therefore we need to let him know that we want to fight just a little bit more than he does. He'll back down. or he'll lose.","Had Obama bombed Syria, Putin would have never felt emboldened to invade Ukraine.","This is the problem with liberals, you think everything comes down to economics. Not having and national pride yourselves, you can't see how anyone else would either. ..Putin is doing what any great leader would do when faced with a weaker leader. he is taking advantage. Had Obama unleashed the full wrath of the US Air Force on Syria after using chemical weapons, or appeared to want war with Iran rather than avoid war, Putin would have thought twice about invading another country. But knowing that the only power that could have stopped him quaked at the idea of confronting Syrian anti-aircraft fire (something the Israelis do any time they want) or the Iranian navy, he felt emboldened. ..Not Poland? Just wait a couple of years.",,,,,,
Angelica,,,,"Putin's misguided and bloody adventure in Ukraine predictably ended in failure and immeasurable damage to regional security, relationship with allies and  the future of Russia. Hopefully Ukraine will be able to separate itself from Russia's suicidal course, it already paid a heavy price. Due to his personal lack of education, sophistication and other shortcomings, Putin, who was never a statesman, only a corrupt chief with no new ideas, aside from those he picked up in his KGB school, will never admit his mistakes. So Western politicians should not just hold their breath. Rather, they should follow containment policy with Russia to make sure its decline is gradual and controlled, not explosive and neighbors, who want to be with civilized world like Ukraine, Georgia and others can protect and liberate themselves.","As Putin (apparently) abandoned his Novorossia project involving cutting Ukraine in half, he left hanging his terrorists, who served him in other little wars he waged in post-soviet space. Judging by the reports that Russian soldiers are shooting at them as they try to return, and some reports that they are shooting at each other and civilians for a picture on Russian TV, it looks like they are judged too extremist for Russia and left to die. Sadly, Ukrainian soldiers defending the country and local civilians misled by Russian propaganda will also die because these crazy and misguided people were given powerful Russian arms. It's really maddening and sad that people should die because of cynical and corrupt leaders like Putin. It happens too often... I know that the world is not always just and he may not end up in Hague, where he belongs, but dictators never end well!","Girkin and Boroday are representatives neither of Eastern Ukraine, nor the two regions invaded by Russian insurgents. Ukrainian government is talking to legitimate representatives of the regions and they want Russian invaders go. Ukrainian government offered the ceasefire already, but they kept killing. Those people are crazy men playing war and there is no point negotiating with them because all they want is war. Russia doesn't want them back either, perhaps that's why they were cynically sent to die in Ukraine. Unfortunately,  they are also killing Ukrainian soldiers and local population and this blood is on the hands of these lunatics as well as Putin's government , who sends them arms.","@ the commenters, who responded to me. Several points:. 1. Ukraine is not a NATO country, but Ukraine is bordering a number of NATO countries like Poland is and they are threatened by the war on its borders. Allowing it to spread is a direct threat to NATO allies..2. Putin openly threatened Baltic states, Poland and other NATO members from Eastern Europe. Their leaders openly expressed their concern..3. Yes, US tax payers have to pay to defend NATO members if they want to honor their obligation under the treaty..3. Budapest memorandum quote: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine. What is not clear about existing borders??..4. US is directly interested in nuclear security and non-proliferation. Breach of US obligations under Budapest Memorandum makes this important instrument useless..Hope I answered your comments.","The rebels are Russian citizens and they have Russian weapons. They are not Ukrainians with opposing views, those are gone, even if there were once. They did not capture any surface to air missiles and even if the did somehow, they would not be able to use them if they were genuine rebels. Ukrainian government is right to not negotiate with Russian citizens, who are war criminals and killers of children and civilians. Their place is in the tribunal together with Putin and Russian army , who supplies them.",Putin doesn't want peace or negotiation  or even a piece of Ukraine at this point...

Not everybody, though, is so gullible and susceptible to Putin's lies.","Before Putin's invasions, there was no US presence on Russia's borders.  After the invasions, there will be.  Lots of them.  You are confused about cause and effect.  You may be spending too much time listening to PUtin's propaganda TV.","I wish like you we could also look at putin and see a rational, cautious, humane, predicable leader, one who is neither erratic nor paranoid, as you do R36, and make the confident predictions you make.  Alas, such confidence as yours can be based on nothing but wishful thinking, weakness and a willful blindness.  Actually, Mr Putin has staged a provocation against a NATO member already, when he ordered the kidnapping of an Estonian border official, whom he still has not released.   In the face of your, and the West's manifest weakness, why should Putin  think he will be stopped? Your decidedly pro-Russian comments do not persuade at all.","Peace in Our Time.  Been there, done that.  The U.S. must seriously consider which European countries it will defend and which it should not and will not.  Either ask appeasing countries undermining or insufficiently committed to sanctions, and (that's most of them) to leave NATO, or the U.S. should withdraw from NATO and form a new defensive alliance only with its true allies, such as Great Britain, Poland, the Baltics, and a few others with the backbone to stand up to aggression (not that Obama has backbone; that of course is part of the problem).  Frank-Walther Steinmeier talked contemptuously about those countries far away (read, the U.S.) having opinions against appeasement.  The last time the faraway countries were invited to turn away, it ultimately resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of American soldiers and the murder of most of the continents 6-7 million jews.  It is high time the europeans were left to make their own accommodations with aggression without the U.S. umbrella.  The US has far more important interests, and should be directing all its efforts at anti-islamic extremism and terrorism.  Let the people who appease suffer the full consequences and depredations of their weakness and cowardice.  Here, they have nearly completely rewarded Putin.  We certainly should not be rewarding or supporting with Putin or the appeasers.","What?  your comment does not make any sense at all and is a bit irrational.  Whether I can look them in the eye or not does not tell me anything, and would not change the fact that they are cowards (or not, as the case may be).  George Bush famously looked into PUtin;'s eyes, and failed to see what he should have seen: PUtin has no soul (LOL!)","Snow white?  LOL! How easily Putin deceives you. He planted bombs in Moscow apartment buildings that blew up his own people so that, as an unknown, he could win an election for president and restart and win the war in chechnya.  Perhaps a Snow white with a ruthless, murderous streak.  And PUtin has many gullible slaves, as can be seen here.",Just give Putin time to control Russia's blogospere.  Dont fool yourself into believing he is not trying!,"Another illusion is it is not a second cold war.    It is not the same cold war, but Russia's illegal, provocative outrageous behavior, including the annexation of Crimea, must not be appeased, ever.   Which is to say, there are many lessons of the cold war that need to be reapplied.  As in the cold war, patience is needed.  Putin will not live forever.  Time to dust off the Long Telegram."
Simon,,,,"Sanctions against Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the other Gulf States who are funding ISIS and Al Qaeda's allies would be far more useful than continuing to try to tangle with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine.","I love how Western politicians and their allies in the corporate media turn corrupt oligarchs like Khodorkovsky into heroes. Khodorkovsky was a corrupt oligarch who stole billions from Russia and sending it outside the country and then decided to meddle in politics to try to protect his self-interests. In other words, he is the Russian version of the Koch brothers. It was not only Putin who turned on him, it was his fellow Russian oligarchs who had no interest in seeing him become their lord and master and happily helped Putin take him down and appropriate his stolen millions.","These comments about Putin blinking shows how we in the West struggle to listen andor understand the Russians. Putin called now because the violent right parties in Ukraine are beginning to turn against the Kiev government. From Putin's perspective this along with the annexation of Crimea gives him the upper hand.  Whether he is right or wrong, we need learn to see situations from his viewpoint so that our diplomacy will be successful.","The Russian people got lucky. They get to keep the rest of their 12 billion that Putin were giving the Ukrainians. Of course, they now have to pay to support Crimea, but they at least, they get a warm water port out of it. We get nothing for the 5 million that Nuland at Obama's behest invested to overthrow Ukraine government and this 1 billion loan guarantee.","I highly doubt that Putin planning to go into Eastern Ukraine. Rather he is using the troops to drive a hard bargain with the EU and U.S...Quite frankly, despite all these minor sanctions and threats, I don't see why Putin should be too worried. Unlike most others, I quite remember Bush and EU making similar ominous declarations when he sent troops into Georgia after it attacked South Ossetia and killed Russian peacekeepers. Bush and EU claimed that Russia would be a pariah nation  if did not retreat to its borders. Instead Russia stayed in place and the sanctions were never implemented after the publicity faded away...Why? Because in the end corporations rule the world and none of them wanted to lose business with Russia so the politicians looked the other way.",,,,,
Longislander2,,,,"Now is the time to let the Russians have Crimea.  Enough with the red lines.  We should focus instead on helping the Ukrainians to bring real democracy to their country and build strong ties with Western Europe.  With Russia annexing Crimea and the West now facing the distinct possibility of bringing Ukraine into its sphere, this situation sounds like a win-win to me or even an ultimate victory for the West . . . assuming Putin is really done with his land grabs...And once all is said and done, perhaps the Ukrainians can teach us how to bring real democracy and justice to another important part of the world:  the U.S.  As examples of corruption pile up within our own government, perhaps we need our own Independence Square to finally turn things around.  For a people that so cherish democracy, Americans no longer practice it in the way it was meant to be.  We would prefer to simply sit on our duffs in front of the TV instead of making our voices heard . . . as the Ukrainians have done.","Putin doesn't take any of these negotiations seriously.  When the other diplomats head home, I'm sure he has a good laugh.  ..I fear the only thing that will make him stand down is a show of force from the West.  Does anyone remember the tense days surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis?  Well, expect to see that again.  Otherwise, the Ukrainians might as well hand over their country right now.","I say to the warmongers, Not so fast.  The U.S. needs to sit back for a while and let European citizens and treasure take a hit for once.  France is a nuclear power and Germany is beyond rich.  Maybe the leaders of those two countries will finally act when Putin's forces reach the outskirts of Berlin and Paris.  ..If we really stood for freedom all over the world, as some say on here, we would have invaded China and North Korea long ago.  Ukraine is not our fight.  At least not yet.  So let's roll back the testosterone and be thankful that President McCain isn't in the White House.","It is not at all a stretch to place partial blame for Putin's audacity on the Republican U.S. Congress.  America used to be known as a country that was on the move, that could provide a growing standard of living, that could maintain its infrastructure, that could do many things and unite in a crisis, all while fielding the world's largest defense budget.  Whatever our faults, we were feared and respected by the Soviets and that helped to keep a lid on things.  Today, Republican intransigence and backward thinking have made us look weak.  We are falling behind in so many categories that we are now viewed as a nation in steep decline by both the Russians and the Chinese.  As a result, we are seeing them act on their views in Ukraine and the Pacific...If we want to restore our respect and clout in the world, we need to get our own house in order.","I am on board with Chris from Arizona when he notes that the U.S. lied to justify the war in Iraq.  So, it was with a chuckle that I listened yesterday to John Kerry accusing Putin of invading a country under false pretenses...With that said, however, let's now use our economic muscle to put pressure on Putin.  Move the G8 summit, take a hard look at Russian business in the U.S. and Western Europe, look at placement of Russian assets, gear up to sell U.S. natural gas to Europe and on and on.  ..I am hoping that once Kerry returns from Ukraine, we will finally see some economic action to back up our words.","I am on board with Chris from Arizona when he notes that the U.S. lied to justify the war in Iraq.

Huh?  Despite McCain's peaceful solutions recommended in this column, we can thank our lucky stars that he never reached the Oval Office.  If he were there now, I'm sure we would be engaged in at least one land war somewhere around the world...President Obama is the first leader in a long time who understands the consequences of sending our young men and women into combat.   He's thinking long and hard about ways to solve this peacefully and he has Kerry talking, talking, talking to the Russians, which is a good thing...With all of this said, however, I fear that Mr. Obama is treating Putin with the same kindness and understanding that he tried to use in bridging the divide with the House Republicans . . . and we can see how that's worked out.  It's great for the President to believe there's some good in everyone, even his most committed adversaries, but sometimes it just isn't so.  At that point, you've got to put down the hammer.",,,
Oaktree,,,,"Good morning my fellow comrades of mother Russia, in order to maintain stability and a strong motherland, I am declaring myself President for life. And any dissension will be taken care off quickly and harshly. Long live the motherland, long live your President.  ... V. Putin (2014)","Very quick to push the military button. I don't suppose it has something to do coming off a high from the successful Olympics Games and those two nationalistic opening and closing ceremonies? It was just a show Mr Putin, relax and rest for awhile this patriotic fever you are experiencing will go away when the bills start coming in...Always dangerous when leaders make critical decisions under an emotional state of mind, whether in distress, like Mr George W Bush invading Iraq while still in the emotional influence of the 911 tragedy, or in a patriotic euphoria, like the Hitler's and Stalin's...Relax Mr Putin give it some time for your mind to rid itself of these irrelevant thought that are clouding your perception of reality. Come down from clouds before your hurt yourself and others.","This tug of war in the former Soviet satellites was inevitable since the treaty was signed to end the cold war. The real test and verification of this end of hostilities between East and West has always been how peaceful the transition will be. ..One can gauge the true commitment of a leader's methodologies of achieving this cause, whether heshe is from the East, West andor in the former Soviet republics. Violence is not a sign of commitment, but rather a sign of failure...It is puzzling and ironic how President Putin has pushed for a peaceful end to the Syrian crisis and in contrast has use an iron fist in both Russia's southern and eastern boarders. What are President Putin's true intentions for the future of Russia and eastern Europe?..Maybe it is time to start negotiating a new treaty with Russia, maybe the West can force Mr Putin's hand?","I am somewhat relieved to see talks starting in Paris. But, there are risks associated with talks and I hope both Mr Obama and European leaders will have a plan to keep things in proper perspective. Whether all parties like it or not, there is a food chain and everyone must know and abide by their position in the food chain, especially Russia. ..Problems (crisis) arise when nations (current leaderships) start using their elbows and knees (military force and blackmail) to advance a few notches in this food chain...Very important that Mr Obama, the leader of the sole superpower and the free world makes it clear that all parties must be realistic in their expectations and limitations. Of course, this also applies to Mr Obama. A show of weakness is not an option, President Obama must maintain a strong and forceful posture in dealing with eastern Europeans and Russia in particular. He must show a willingness to continue the policies that won the peace and ended the cold war. The policies of FDR, RFK, Nixon, and Reagan and NOT Carter, Clinton and Bush's (and I include both Bush's, Bush senior messed up right from the start of treaty that supposed to have ended the cold war)...Know and exercise your position in the food chain Mr Obama and dictate to Mr Putin his position.","Could comrade Putin be taking advantage of recent unrest in Ukraine to finally play out his hand? Timing could not have been any better to finally make his long awaited move...First, a lame duck US president with less than two years left in office, historically, presidents have been proven to be weakened and slow in responding to global crisis...Second, he has established a very powerful choke hold in Russian political theater with basically a one party system almost like the good old totalitarian Soviet regime...And now Ukraine, whether Putin instigated the recent unrest or not is irrelevant because the West has been sleeping and paying no attention to Eastern Europe since Yugoslavia and the crazy and fascist Serbians did their thing. We were too busy playing cowboys in the mountains and deserts. ..Of course, Putin will use Kosovo as a precedence any college political student would factor that in the daily watch of Russian geopolitical maneuvering. Of course, he will see the US as a weakened and immobile tiger, the teeth may still be there but not will nor the coordinated, strong USEuropean coalition that was there before George W Bush...So what is comrade Putin up to in Ukraine? Annex back some of the buffer zone that once protected the motherland? Maybe use the expected sanctions from the West to final declare himself President for life?..I hope comrade Putin and his chess playing colleagues have calculated the endgame properly and realized there is no checkmate.",,,,,
Kneevak,,,,"Sadly we need to face a stark and inevitable reality, we need to start to arm the Ukraine. I do not take this position lightly. I was against the war in Iraq and I never wanted to go into Afghanistan. I do NOT believe the US should be the world's police force however, Putin will continue to push his expansionist policies until someone stands up to him. That somone needs to be a joint effort of the entire world and must be led by Europe and the US. We need to start sending arms and advisors. Ukraine must prepare itself for war because unless they take agressive steps NOW, thay are going to lose more than just Crimea. The time for moderate diplomacy is over, the world must stand united and strong against Putin and we must prepare ourselves for war on every level.","History has taught us that American isolationism on the European front, leads to wars - big wars. While Ukraine may be closer to Russia, it is not more important to Russia than it is to the European Union when it comes to an overly nationalistic republic that commits acts of war on its neighbours. To simply allow Putin to run amuck out of a position of fear, will lead to disaster...The belief that Putin believes the Ukraine is a National Security threat is a red-herring thrown forth by Putin to excuse his aggression; it is not a valid opinion. Putin does not lay awake thinking at night that he is going to be under attack by some rogue Ukrainian onslaught, to think otherwise is foolish. Putin wants the Crimea and the Ukraine so he can exploit it for purposes of self-enrichment, hubris, and to aid his billionaire pals.  The author also uses this Russian invasion as a guise to assail the Obama administrations foreign policy, a rhetoric that is baseless. The opinion that asserting strength (not threats), will somehow lead Putin to act more aggressively, is pure fodder. The more you back away from this ultra-nationalistic, xenophobic bully, the more aggressive he will become, not the opposite...The Obama administrations actions have been succinct, mature, and accurate; a strong world front led by the EU, aid to the Ukrainian economy, isolation and economic punishment for Russia, and the meaningful display that the NATO alliance has teeth, is the correct course of action.","The fascist term, in this case, is a red-herring employed by Putin and his cohorts to demonize his opposition. The truth is most of the so-called fascists are actually Nationalists who have always distrusted and hated Russia. I wonder why?","Two ironies here; first the celebration of a day where Russia (alone?) defeated the Nazi's - while these same people simultaneously pay homage to Stalin??? What? Maybe they are celebrating the fact that Stalin killed more Russians than Hitler even came close to?..Seeing the pomp and circumstance of the parade and celebration, I am struck by the fact that very soon many of these people will be starving in the street. As Putin rides his horses, lives like a king with billions in the bank, and 40 or so mansions at his disposal, the common person will soon be waiting in lines, deja vu to the old Soviet Union, when many people had to do a Pearl Buck and get close to the Good Earth for food.","Interesting that Putin's Russia doesn't feel that invading the sovereignty a foreign nation, creating an armed insurgency, murdering foreign citizen's, kidnapping journalists, performing black ops on foreign soil, and attempting to overthrow a foreign government, isn't viewed as a military response - but taking back homogenous governmental offices from armed captors speaking Russian - is justification for threatened genocide...There is no question now that Putin has committed war crimes via the actions of the soldiers under his command in breaking the Geneva peace settlement. It is time the West treats him like the war criminal he is. I do feel sorry for the average Russian citizen who is about to be thrown into hell by their own dictator.","You're advocating slavery? I guess Putin musn't be too bad a guy in your eyes and how about his pre-cursor's Wihlelm, Stalin and Hitler - no problem there either, right?","Tine for you to re-read your history of WW1, WW2, and the cold war. Pay a little now, or pay a lot more later - and that is especially true for the EU. Putin's time for pain is coming.",,,
Brian Sussman,,,,The Russians are the fascists who deserve no respect...Did Vlad Putin do the Goosestep after he stole Crimea?..What will Putin steal next?,"To Mike Murray MD:..Ukraine has not been part of Russia since 1918...Ukraine and Russia were each separate republics, within the now-non-existent USSR between 1922 and 1991...Even while part of the USSR, Ukraine had been recognized by the UN as an independent Republic since the UN's founding in 1945. Proof of that, is that Ukraine and Belarus have been original members of the UN and each had its own seat and voting delegate on the UN, separate from the USSR's UN seat and delegate, since the UN founding...So you are historically mistaken, and probably you have swallowed some of Putin's lying propaganda. Check on your facts before posting your fictions as if they were true.","Putin and his fascist government should cooperate by withdrawing the Russian military and Russia's agents from Ukraine, and by allowing the Ukrainian government to put down the civil war that the fascist dictator Putin began and encouraged...Until then, the EU and USA should fully sanction and boycott the Russian dictatorship.",The USA can trust Iran far more thsn it it can trust Russia. We'd be better off moving Russian uranium to Iran than moving Iran's uranium to Russia...We need to find a better place to move Iranian uranium. And we need to protect Ukraine and other nations from Putin's fascist aggressions.,"I agree with you, but what can we do?..Europe is too selfish and short of foresight, to risk a natural gas shortage, resulting from protecting Ukraine...Europe is afraid of Russia cutting their fuel, but Europe would send a very strong and frightening message by boycotting Russian fuel and all things Russian...Instead, probably Europe will cave in to Putin in 2014 just like it did with Hitler's provocations against Austria and Czechoslavakia in tbe 1930's. What will it take for Europe to stand up? Another invasion of Poland?..Probably what needs to be done, at a minimum, is to admit Ukraine into NATO and to close the Turkish Straits to Russia's access from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean upon further Russian provocations.","Since Russia insists it has the right to invade other countries where there are Russian speakers, we must conclude Russia would include Brooklyn as a possible place to invade...Of course that is an absurdity, but Crimea and Ukraine are not part of Russia just like Brooklyn andr Belarus and Poland...Russia and its fuhrer Vlad Putin are fascist entities that decent people need to stand up against...Obviously a World War needs to be avoided. Then again, WWII began because Neville Chamberlain, at Munich, was trying to avoid another WWI...The tragedy of the WWII, is that it would have been easy for UK andor France andor Russia to stop Hitler at Munich, in which case the German military would likely have overthrown Hitler by 1939 and avoided both WWII and the Holocaust..The current tragedy is that, if Putin's Russia successfully grabs up Crimea, or other parts of Ukraine, then the fascist Putin will feel empowered to invade Belarus or Poland or other sovereign parts of the former USSR and Warsaw Pact...At a minimum, all economic relations must permanently cease between between fascist Russia and the democratic nations of Europe and the Americas, if Russia incorporates Crimea, Ukraine or any other nations or regions of nations.","It is the Russians' own support of Putin and their love of mindless self-destructive dictatorships that is destroying Russia. This problem exists now, under the USSR and under the Tsars...Most Ukrainians know this, and want to remain independent of Russia. Those who want to reunite with Russia should move to Russia, rather tham advocate destroying an independent, sovereign Ukraine.","Putin and his Russian dictatorship are the evil fascist element in this tragedy...Ukraine is in the situation of 1930's Czechoslovakia. Hopefully, in the 21st Century, the EU, NATO and USA won't take the disgraceful approach in the Ukraine, that Neville Chamberlain took in the 1930's...If Russia were to seize eastern Ukraine, it is important that EU, NATO and USA react strongly. If that occurs, a possible solution would be to admit Ukraine into NATO, and to close to Russia, the Turkish straits connecting the Black Sea to the Mediteranean. There is no way Russia would start a World War, so Russia would have to back down.",,
Sue,,,,"It's time to leave it be. It's been an argument that has been brewing since the collaspe of the USSR in Crimea. When the Russians pulled out and left Ukraine on it's own they left little to build any sort of infrastructure. They even took the toilets in public places..The average person has had a very hard 12 yrs there. They were sick and tired of one bad leader after another skimming public money for their own use..I think if Putin really means to stop at Crimea then an enormous show of good will would be to loose Yanukovich. His grandiose thievery was way over the top, even those solidly pro-Russian were horrified by it. He needed to go one way or another.","There were a lot of Crimeans that were willing to go with Ukraine and it's infant democracy when the Soviet Union fell but Kleptocrat after Kleptocrat left a very bad taste in their mouth. It's been a hard time for them. There has been little work, sometimes no heat. Pensions were often not paid. Ukraine blew it..The referendum would have come about anyway. Yes, Putin could have pulled it off more elegantly. It was going to happen on it's own. He just did the very Russian flair for the dramatic thing and sent the message that Russia is still very relevant...Why would most of the people vote this way? It wasn't the soldiers.

Add the worry that the new regime really does have some known thugs and the referendum got rushed. It would have happened anyway...Putin is no Stalin. He knows he has to live on the same planet as the rest of us. Crimea is lost but it wasn't lost to Russian soldiers. It was lost to politicians that had their own agenda and not the best interests of the common people in mind.","The last thing you want to do is not talk with Russia. The leaders need to all sit down and really communicate..Sanctions are only going to make Putin stick his heals in deeper. Talk to him, not at him or down to him. Equal ground..Sanctions aren't going to leave Putin hungry, he's still going to have his choice of foods for dinner. The average Russian however might go without and that is only going to serve to alienate us even more. ..Yes, in my American eyes Putin is a heavy handed dictator however he is no Stalin. The legacy of the Ottoman Empire and the Golden Horde runs deep in Russia. Putin most likely is holding powers that are much worse at bay. He is well aware that the world has become a very small place and we all need to work together. Talk to him. You may be surprised.  ..As far as Crimea goes most of the regular people wanted to go back to Russia. I have a friend I talk to regularly from Crimea and he was very happy to have the Russian soldiers there. A very telling sentence from him once the vote was tallied, We are finally home..  ..Talk to the Russians. It was all the behind the scene manueverings that pushed Putin to this. Talk. No fakes, no phony. Just talk. Face to face and real.","They need to include Russia and actually talk. Both sides actually, really communicate...Economic sanctions? This will only hurt the common person. Putin will still have a steak for dinner. The regular people will go without another night.","Robert you ignore the history. The Crimea has been part of Russia since it was won away from the Khanate by Catherine the great's army.

While I view Putin as a heavy handed dictator with my American eyes I do believe he is keeping some that would be much, much worse from coming to power.","Kind of odd that I had to go to the Prague Post to get the full text of Putin's Crimea speech.

I didn't realize John Kerry is of Ukrainian heritage.  ..Its presumptuous for either Russia or America to discuss constitutional reforms in Ukraine. ..But the politicians there would be well served to abandon the old pattern of having their base of power heavily concentrated in one part of the country and then pretend that their voice speaks for all of the people...Ukraine had its own identity for centuries but the state only came to be only after the fall of the red empire. So far state institutions and its leaders have been more interested in self enrichment as they were in shaping the government to reflect and serve all of its people...The West stands by demonizing Russian influence and Kremlin does the same with the west. But no progress can be made until the politicians on the ground recognize the diversity of their country (ideological, historical and linguistic) and begin to work with it instead of sweeping it under the rug. ..Contrarily to western coverage, Putin's biggest lever of influence in Ukraine isn't natural gas or military force. It's the alienation of a sizable chunk of Russian speakers from the new government. Pretending that thousands of people who waive Russian flags in Donetsk have all been bused in from Russia and shouting Glory to Ukraine! Glory to their Heroes! in a Kiev square won't solve the problem.","As in most developing countries, the Russian stock market is more speculative and less indicative of the real Russian economy than markets in the West...The reason Russian stocks took a dive has less to do with the actual sanctions that took effect and more with a threat of further escalation of the crisis and newer sanctions to come...Investors have shown no moral qualms about pouring billions into China with its abysmal human rights record and they could care less about Crimea and the heady debates about what it means about the future of freedom in eastern Europe. ..By liming his response to new sanctions, Putin appears to attempt to cool down the situation. So far Russia added its first territory since the fall of USSR, annexing a peninsula with a two million population and paying for it by having 30 Russians banned from the west and a medium-sized bank cut off from Wall Street. ..Though Putin will continue to try to influence Ukraine, I really doubt he will launch an invasion in the east. Industrial Donetsk doesn't have the same pull for his heart as the coastal Crimea with a massive military base, an overwhelming Russian majority and massive reserves of shell gas. ..If the threat of military installation recedes investors will see green in Russian stocks again and they will make a partial recovery. So far Putin has been playing a cold game of geopolitical chess and the chaos in Ukraine allowed him to score a major victory.","This is an easy sentiment to express from Philadelphia and a little more challenging one to voice in Berlin.

Putin's popularity in Russia declined from a high of 83 to a low of 54 when it was last measure by Gallup a month ago. It is likely to spike as a result of Crimea annexation...Putin remains a relatively popular leader because of the economy and a sense of stability that Russians didn't have since Leonid Brezhnev was in the Kremlin. When Putin assumed office in 2000 Russia's GDP was 260 billion dollars today it stands at a little over 2 trillion. Certainly the price of oil and natural gas were not incidental to this rise but -contrary to prediction of Putin's critics- the minute those prices went down the regime did not implode. The 2008 global recession hit Russian GDP hard but it recovered and grew over 80 since 2009. ..No matter how odious and authoritarian Putin is in the eye of the West compared to Russian neighbors of Belarus and Ukraine, Russia is a relative success. Russian GDP per capita is more than twice that of Ukraine. Before Putin, Russians were ruled by an incompetent idealist (Gorbachev) and  an incompetent drunk (Yeltsin). As much as Americans and Russian liberals dislike Putin many Russians have a real reason to like him. Stability is taken for granted in the West but was a rarest of commodities in modern Russian history.",,,,,
Aaron,,,,"The reason why Putin or Lavrov have no one to speak with is due to the invasion of  a sovereign state and justifying said invasion with keeping ethnic Russians safe. If the justification over Crimea is that it has belonged to Russia historically; thus, should remain so, then should not KaliningradKonigsberg belong to Germany? The reality is Putin does not trust the democracy that put him in the position in which he is in and takes every opportunity to undermine what he perceives as the great evil of the world--the west. His short sighted, self preservationist view point is why there is state run, state funded propaganda lambasting anything that is perceived to be American in Russia..While American foreign policy is not by any means something that one should be proud of,  the idea Putin's reasoning for circumventing diplomatic channels is because he has no one to speak to makes you it sound like you've been drinking the kool-aid. Putin circumvents these channels to pander to the same people who desire conservative strong leaders that brought us to this current situation in the first place. In short, Putin benefits from the mistakes of the West because he uses said mistakes to legitimize his repressive autocracy.",Obama is understandably sheepish about engaging ISIS- but I can't believe he would consider this move! This is a huge mistake. Putin will counterbalance anything the U.S. does to bolster military readiness and make a larger display of showing Russian force and resolve.

tiddle,,,,"Nah, Putin has no use for the czar anymore, as long as he remains the supreme leader.","Are you really that sure of that? ..Afterall, all these breakaway republics used to be part of USSR. What would have stopped Putin's pretense of going after all of them since technically they were once part of his motherland?","See, the thing is, dictatorship or otherwise, Putin's belligerence has overwhelming support of his own people within Russia. He's succeeded in pushing the right button to gain popular support within his own border which is not unlike what Hitler did back then on his rise to power. The resemblance is eerily similar.","The key to an effective sanction against Russia is really dependent on strong unified response from Europe. US can impose whatever travel ban to individuals, but it's like scratching your leg over a layer of thick socks and heavy boots (ie. your leg won't feel a thing, however hard you scratch)...To be sure, Europe is beholden on oil and energy from Russia, and Putin knows it. He's counting on the weak minds in EU and lesser European cohorts to not daring to cut off oilgas from Russia, and would just wish everything to quiet down, so that they can go about their merry way once again. Unless and until US can assure a more reliable alternative energy source for its EU allies, Europe will bend over for Russia. ..Tough talks are just that - talk. And talk is cheap; in any case, it's not conceivable that any american officials can talk tougher than Putin who's getting high marks from most average russians for standing up for its motherland.","The crimean vote has given Putin big boost in moral high grounds, as if he really needs one. Military incursion and economic sanction could not be good for Russia, and Putin knows it. That's assuming Putin putting on his reasonable man man, which is hardly a given. The best outcome for Putin, is for Kiev to blink first, cave in to the crimean referendum, and let crimea secede; then Russia can rightfully match into Crimea and Kiev will pull out all the Ukrainian troops. The billionaire-dollar question is of course: Would that really happen?",,,,,
Tired of Hypocrisy,,,,It's very clear that a large group of those who comment in the NYT believe that since the United States government was guilty in the past of doing whatever it is that Putin is presently doing then what he's doing is totally fine. Not only is it totally fine but Putin should be left alone to accomplish what he started out to do because who are we to interfere.    ..Two wrongs certainly do make right in the NYT!,"Judy, liberal progressive Americans always think in geo-political terms. Open borders, world citizenship, kum-by-ya is all the rage in the United States. They just don't understand why Putin doesn't get it!","Judy, liberal progressive Americans always think in geo-political terms.

Richard Estafire,,,,But is Putin really behind this discord in east Ukraine? Check out the Gallup Poll on Ukraine that was taken in early June. You'll be surprised at what the statistics indicate.,"As for this being Obama's fault, nothing could be farther from the truth. It was not Obama that sent 10,000 troops to Crimea, that would have been Putin...Putin didn't send troops to Crimea; they were already stationed there. Russian troops have had a strong presence in Crimea since the 1780s. That's why the majority of the population in Crimea is Russian. ..Note that the Russian natives of Crimea made the decision to split with Ukraine. The only controversy is whether Putin made the right call by annexing Crimea so quickly.",,,,,,,,
Equilibrium,,,,The fact that quite a few people in the USA are aware that current crisis in Ukrain has been initiated by the interference of the USA in internal political events of Ukrain is the best confirmation of effectiveness of US State propaganda but not Putin's one. Listen to Psaki comments - they are simply mockery - russians are guilty in Ukrain crisis because they are bad guys when USA and pro-US politicians in Kiev are like angels no matter how many people of Donbass are killed as result of pro-USA ukrainian military attack. The true is as follows - the USA has impeled this civilian war in Ukrain consciously to destroy Russian -EU cooperation in energy industry and then to seize European energy market.,"The ukrainian and russian languages are very similar. What is the english speaking USA doing in Ukrain? What Germany, France, Britain are doing there? What do they forget there? Democratic values? This is ridiculous. So, this is the invasion of Ukrain by the West, hidden and sophisticated. And the reason as follows: The USA are afraid that if Ukrain and Russia would combine then very serious competitor to USA arise, so the USA's reasons - separate and dominate. THe Europe are dying, the birth rate is declining, the average age is rising, Europe needs just fresh blood. USA-EU should not spend their forces to tell around the world the stories about democracy, because their real goal are different and obvious. In such circumstances Russia has no choice except fighting for Ukrain. And I hope that our President Vladimir Putin who I respect will not step back. We survived and won in the World War II. And we will survive and win now.",,,,,,,,
Hank,,,,"After Hitler got Sudetenland he wanted the whole of Tjeckoslovakia,Austria and finally Polen.What wants Putin after Crimea - Ukraina,Belorussia,the Baltic Republics and finally Poland?",The cool thing about Putin is that he would actually do all that stuff.,Its about losing just the Ukraine or everything.Does Putin know that?,Nobody should talk to Putin until his gangsters have left the Ukraine.Its a big misstake to believe in a diplomatic solution to the russian destabilization efforts in the country.Putin considers all talk as  weakness.,"About the only thing that will remove the stink of complicity from Russia would be insistence on handing over the flight data recorders, regardless of who had them,  to international analysis.  Anything short of that essentially convicts Mr. Putin of being the international hooligan we already suspect he is.",Just another Putin bluff to make us believe that the thugs do not stand under Moscows command!,Article- There was no discussion of what Russia might receive in return for its assistance. ..It's no secret Mr. Putin has visions of reincarnating the Soviet Union. What better start than buying the single most important part.,,,
G-man,,,,"I think expecting Russia to give up Crimea will be about like asking Israelis to give up control of Jerusalem.  Ain't gonna happen.  The Russians may take a page from the Israelis and negotiate while gradually and incrementally making more and more annexations.  Except Russia can take cities and provinces one at a time instead of land parcels..Russia may also take another page, from the Kosovo crisis, to do what the Albanians in Kosovo did.  The Albanians established a parallel society, peacefully, to make Serbian sovereignty meaningless.  Transniestra has already done this with Moldova, and Russia already has the precedent of administering their Kaliningrad territory as a disconnected part of Russia.  The Russians could just make it another oblast- administratively - and take it over without sending in any troops at all..Russia holds most of the cards in regaining its former Russian-inhabited Soviet territories; the West has very few.  Israel has shown one way of how to keep the level of annexations at a low-boil so that the world won't turn on them.  But Russia has the disadvantage of not having a sympathetic media in the West while they do their annexations so it remains to be seen if they can pull this off peacefully.  I don't think that Putin wants to send in the tanks in the style of Brezhnev with Czechoslovakia or Khrushev with Hungary, but I think he will if he's backed into a corner and can't get what he wants any other way.","Remember the words spoken in the movie Michael Collins when Liam Neeson said, We've been playing by their rules Harry.  The next time, we'll make our own rules.  Putin is making his own rules and playing by them as he sees fit..None of the former Soviet states have completed a successful transition to democracy.  Some of their leaders are less ruthless and autocratic than others, but none are shining examples of Jeffersonian democracy.  Yet we persist in singling out Russia for special attention because They're the glue that holes the countries of the former Soviet Union together.  Russian is still widely spoken and two of the biggest nations (Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan) continue to use the Cyrullic alphabet, whereas Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan switched over to the Latin alphabet for their Turkic-derived languages..Did George Soros think there would be no backlash against the West for bringing down Russia's economy in 1997?  Those who supported this only cared about triggering an emigration of Russian Jews to Israel.  And now the only reason we care so much about this is that Israel's oil supplies pass through the eye of the needle (Azerbaijan and Georgia) from Central Asia to the Mediterranean.","Today's Russia is not the Soviet Union,  Putin doesn't need to send in tanks.  He can just order the natural gas from Russia to be shut off, if a new government threatens to do something not to his liking or approval.","The G-8 is kind of pointless today except as a photo op.  The real action occurs in meetings of central banks, and in the G-20..I guess Putin's mistake was that he should have done his annexation gradually over a longer period of time, like the Israelis and Chinese do with their versions of ethnic cleansing.","I think the Obama Administration has the right strategy of keeping relatively low-key sanctions.  Let it be known that if Putin does take over Ukraine, he would pay an increasingly heavy price for moving to take over other former Soviet states..I don't think that the Russian leadership would be interested in taking over Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan.  That would put them on a direct border with Iran, and that might be more trouble for them than its worth.  However, I think that Russia might find it worthwhile to take over Armenia and Georgia, So that ought to be the real question.  What would the US and its NATO allies do in response if Russia took over Armenia andor Georgia?.I think it would be worthwhile for NATO to state that if Russia takes over Armenia andor Georgia that their presence in the Kaliningrad oblast would history; that NATO would invade and divide it between Poland and Lithuania.  That's the one thing that could be done without launching a direct attack on Russia proper.","Russia and Canada are both net winners from global warming.  And if the Middle East continues to implode, Russia will stand ready to pick up the slack on energy deliveries.  Would you take a bet that the Middle Eastern oil supplies will continue to be available 10-20 years from now, given the unstable military and religious situation there?  I think that's a bet Putin stands a better than even chance of winning.","I believe Putin is keeping all his options open, which includes annexation of eastern Ukraine and Crimea.  If he thought he could do that without igniting an armed struggle against the western Ukraine, he would have already done it.  It's not in Russia's interest to have a weak Ukraine on its borders, just a compliant region.  In Putin's calculus, Russia would benefit from having an economically viable Ukraine, as long as it is not tied to the EU.","I believe Putin is keeping all his options open, which includes annexation of eastern Ukraine and Crimea.

In Putin's calculus, Russia would benefit from having an economically viable Ukraine, as long as it is not tied to the EU.","Another thought.  I don't think that China would sit by idly and allow Russia to re-form the Soviet Union.  That's another thing in all of this that restrains Putin, even if he wanted to re-take Central Asia, which I doubt.  So I think we should not have hit the panic button, and have a balanced set of responses that does not over-react.  If Putin tries to re-take eastern Ukraine militarily, then that would be the time to have a harsher response.","I have to say that I don't see a heck of a lot of difference between Russians in Crimea wanting to join with their mother country, versus Albanians in Kosovo wanting to do the same thing.  The Albanians were prevented by the Serbs from using their own language in education, commerce, and government, just like the Ukrainians want to do with Russians in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine.  And we supported the Albanians..Lets at least discuss the real reason why the US so opposed to this Crimean annexation.  There's a lot of energy resources from Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, and US strategists are afraid that Russian might try to reach out to recapture those energy rich regions.  At that point, Russia would have control over of the bulk of Eurasia's natural gas supply and much of its petroleum as well.   So, we oppose this for the same reason that the British carved up the Persian Gulf into a bunch of little sheikdoms; so that no one country would have all the energy resources within their boundaries.  Most of the older population in these Central Asian countries would happily rejoin with Russia; the USSR days are remembered fondly as a time of peace and relative prosperity (compared to what the average person has now anyway).  But the younger people would rebel and I don't think Putin wants to take that on.  What he can do is to throw a money-wrench into Western plans and that's what he's doing now; just to show that Russia still counts for something."
Bill B,,,,"Get over it CAF.It wasn't a coup, it was a popular uprising that started when Yanukovich tried to crack down on the Maidan and which ended when his political allies and security forces bailed on him in the wake of the EU agreement.  Putin then engaged in a land grab backed by a spurious referendum and contributed leaders, arms and military support to a rebellion that he sponsored.","As you happened to leave out, when characterizing my comment, the so what? is EU sanctions. ..As I said--...and Putin is placing some importance on not being so overt in his assistance to the Donbass rebels, presumably to avoid tighter sanctions and to try to bring about the lapsing of those sanctions already in effect.","That overlooks the fact that the bigger the Russian effort is, the harder it will be to deny; and Putin is placing some importance on not being so overt in his assistance to the Donbass rebels, presumably to avoid tighter sanctions and to try to bring about the lapsing of those sanctions already in effect.  ..The US really doesn't care enough to spend the blood and treasure.It shouldn't spend any blood, but it is already spending treasure.

The fight between Yanukovich and the Maidan took over three months to culminate in the former's fleeing power, an action that took place without the military or security forces taking control...recrudescence of Nazi-like policy.A ridiculous characterization showing both factual and moral misjudgment but proof that Godwin's law still holds true.","Russia's not being a part of Europe has to do with it being an authoritarian kleptocracy, and Russia has already started a race with it's, shall we say, friskier military activities in the Baltic.  Ambassador Matlock's assertion is based on the false premise that the Cold War ended because Gorbachev made nice rather than the internal rot of the Soviet Union.  As to the expansion of NATO, Russian aggression towards Ukraine more than vindicates it.  It's also a misuse of the term bully to allow independent countries into a voluntary alliance like NATO is they wish to enter...they are intent in sabotaging advances in a civic Russia..Actually, Putin is doing far more in that regard than the US possibly could.","@Dan Stackhouse.Ukraine did not kick the bear, it simply refused to let the bear dictate its foreign policy.  Putin essentially pressured his client Yanukovich into rejecting the EU deal--that is hardly the bear leaving them alone.","If Putin had wanted it, he would have taken the region months ago..You're assuming that he would be willing to put is troops in that area in an open and aboveboard manner instead of inserting them in ways that allows him to lie about it...original dream of cleansing Ukraine of Ukrainians of Russian origin. .You've provided no proof that such is the plan.","NATO made no such promise not to expand.

He misses the key facts that the Guatemala and Iran coups were done through the manipulation of levers of state power by insiders.  In the case of Iran, it involved the Shah and members of the military while Guatemala was a straightforward military coup.  Parry is simply attempting to redefine the term for his rhetorical purposes.  In doing so, he also relies on the Nuland canard when, in fact, he offers no evidence that had any power to choose anyone.  The giving of money to NGOs over a period of time does nothing to prove that the Maidan or the 328 members of the Rada whoa voted against Yanukovich were paid for...Theres' no evidence of Russian regular troops in Eastern Ukraine.That simply is not the case.  Russian soliders have been observed by OSCE, families of Russians killed in Ukraine have spoken out and the fact that Putin just had to classify information about Russians killed in Ukraine is telling.  Given that there was no evidence of ethnic-Russian Ukrainians having been in danger prior to an uprising started by Russian clients (including bussed in Russian protestors) and led initially by Russian nationals, the protecting Russians excuse is pretextual..<a hrefhttp:www.bbc.comnewsworld-europe-31794523 titlehttp:www.bbc.comnewsworld-europe-31794523 targetblank>http:www.bbc.comnewsworld-europe-31794523<a>..As to Crimea, that vote took place after Russian seizure of the territory, harassment of anti-annexationist sentiment and with no observers.  Said harassment continues and invalidates the polls Parry refers to.","Kennan may have predicted less friendly relations with Russia but he certainly didn't predict a Russian land grab.  Further, given that the expansion of NATO to Poland and the Baltic States took place in the late-90s and the Russian invasion of Crimea took place fifteen years later, it is far more logical to look to more recent causes of the Russian action like, say, losing a client leader in 2014...Ultimately, the expansion of NATO was a defensive act done with countries that had every right as sovereign countries to join it.  To think that at all justifies Putin's actions, you'd have to have been born yesterday.  Further, the lack of Russia integration in Europe has far more to do with it being an authoritarian kletocracy than with the expansion of NATO."
Kevin Rothstein,,,,"There is very little we can do at this point. The coup in Ukraine, overthrowing a legally elected president, scared the living daylights out of Putin. Add in the possibility that the West may have been involved in Ukrainian politics and it is no surprise what Putin did...We can only hope the sanctions will work.

And the truth is that putin will now start stealing even more money from russians given the support the russians are giving him now.,"There is no such a thing as a russian service in putin's russia today. The  syndicate in the kremlin cannot and would not revive anything since the only thing they are capable of doing is to steal and extort..Of course, the propaganda in the gas station state would tell you how serious they are to start creating something really russian. But in the reality russians will see just more of their moneys stolen and taken away by the gangsters in the kremlin.",,,,,,,
Mark Dobias,,,,The sanctions made Putin feint.,"Putin lives in the neighborhood. He needs to keep a lid on this festering mess. This is not an elective intervention for Russia...I have not heard many protests from Israel, let alone Europe about this intervention. ..We need to butt out.",,,,,,,,
Jamie,,,,"So much of the Crimea coverage is attempting to stoke some kind of American indignation, yet I don't have any. Why? America needs to look to its own history...Consider how the U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas (indeed, a complete political invention) from Mexico. Send White settlers into Mexico to attain a critical mass, they make an uprising and say the populace no longer wants to be part of Mexico. Fight war to scare off brown people. Done. Texas is now part of the Union...But, some of you will say, America learned its lesson about land grabbing in order to make strategic borders. I think not. If America learned its lesson, then Congress would apologize and give back Texas and other lands it unlawfully obtained. Fat chance right?..You see, once a land grabber, always a land grabber.  Obama try as you might but there is no moral high ground here. The U.S. has done worse in the past than Putin accomplished here in 2014.","I feel what most commenters don't get here is that Russia is not, and never will be, the Soviet Union.  Russia does not have the population, or population growth, to be a superpower ever again.  Folks are getting apopletic about the annexation of a tiny piece of land. That's all really, that Russia can manage at this this point in their history. Russia is not even a match for Germany or NATO comparatively. Putin knows this...You see, sometimes despots get that the media is the best tool to make their presence and power seem much larger than it really is, and oh so many of you are playing right along.","I suspect Putin's intentions are less ideological and more practical.  He's got a tiger by the tail.  His is the rule of the strongman.  Strongmen don't retire.  They lose power only through death or overthrow.  A strongman can never appear to be weak.  To be weak invites overthrow and overthrow means death.  For his own literal survival he can never appear to back down.  Short of force, the only way out of this situation is to engineer a resolution by which Putin saves face and appears not to have backed down.  Whether that resolution can be engineered only time will tell.","I suspect Putin's intentions are less ideological and more practical.  He's got a tiger by the tail.

Bill,,,,"I don't like Putin but he is correct on this issue. Se finance the overthrow of a legitimate government in Ukraine, just ask Victoria Nuland and NED. ..Putin is talking about moving medium sized nuclear weapons to the border because we are talking about moving heavy armaments there. Just about all his actions have been reactions. ..We clearly have a war party in this country and they are currently guiding policy. ..We have slapped Russia in the face often but Ukraine was a step too far. We are driving Russia and China together and right now we have the upper hand but that may not be true in a few years.","Hi George, how long have you been one of Putin's Internet Trolls?  Putin is in denial of his own actions and reality, while the Russian people suffer.  The only question is how long Russian Citizens will continue to tolerate Stalin 2.0.",Spoiler alert:  here is another Putin Internet Troll.,"Yes, all those Republicans (I'm talking to you Rudy) who want Obama to be more like Putin - now THERE'S a leader!!    <a hrefhttp:on.rt.comdnzwkv titlehttp:on.rt.comdnzwkv targetblank>http:on.rt.comdnzwkv<a>","This is another in Mr. Cohen's vexatious diatribes against Mr. Putin and Russia.  Russia's actions in the Ukraine are widely approved by both the Russian and Crimean people.  Let's not forget that Yanukovych received more than a million vote margin in Crimea in his last election, and that the Crimean people overwhelmingly preferred the annexation by Russia, the country that they were a part of until a short time ago and whose southern fleet has long been located there..Missing from Mr. Cohen's analysis is any reference to any strategic interest that we in the U.S. have in the Ukrainian dispute.  Because there is none.  Suggestions that Russia seeks to annex other neighbors is simply without any factual support. And references to American weakness is just nonsense, and fear mongering..Cohen needs to leave his emotional bias in a room away from his computer.","I seem to remember that we helped finance violence in the streets to overthrow a legitimately elected government. Putin is terrible in many respects but he did not start this conflict, the west did. How did they think he'd react when a government on his border was overthrown and a pro western government was installed, thanks to an assist by Victoria Nuland.",Your moral equivalency is tiring. I'm sure you are just fine with Putin's suppression of his people and killing of Ukrainians.,"Baker's reporting seems better suited to People Magazine.  Our national press as villianized Mr. Putin for actions that our government would have taken, and perhaps worse.  Ukraine was once a unit within the Soviet Union.  The people of Crimea speak Russian and overwhelmingly prefer to be a Russian state rathan than a part of Ukraine. And the poples of eastern Ukraine, who also speak Russian, want greater autonomy from a historically corrupt Ukraining government.  And Ukraine is right next door to Russia.  So why is that our business?  Of course, it's not.  As Mr. Putin has remarked, put dots on the map where there are U.S. bases and Russian bases, and see who is the troublemaker.","I think that only an insane person and only in a dream can imagine that Russia would suddenly attack NATO, just ask the Ukrainians about Russian aggression!  The only thing Putin respects is the barrel of a large caliber weapon pointed at him.","I'm not a Putin fan like many of our right wingers are but I do realize he did not start this fight. We had money to finance violence in the streets for the overthrow of a legitimate government. If this happened on our borders, we'd be reacting much more strongly than Putin is. ..Once again we stirred the pot, caused a lot of trouble and now don't know what to do with it. Just as in the Middle East which has been a mess since the west arrived, we continue to make it worse to advacne our oil interests."
Tim Kane,,,,"Politically, Putin today occupies the same place that Hitler held...He is impelled by nationalism that is amplified by the experience of national humiliation of Russia during the 1990s and the collapse of their economy and so many institutions, following the loss of the Cold War due to financial reasons (the plummet in oil prices in the 1980s). Putin is nostalgic for that earlier era of a strong Soviet Union. This humiliation gives birth to a sort of nationalism that is crude and offensive even in its mildest manifestations. Remember Germans in the 1930s...This in turn puts Putin and therefore Russia in a revisionist position in the diplomacy of the areas which they are tangent to, which is entirely what Germany was in the 1930s. Fortunately Putin's Russia does not have relatively well functioning economic institutions like Germany had...Putin is entirely a monster of our own selfish making. After WWI the allies imposed a humiliating treaty on Germany and that paved the way for the emergence of a Hitler. After WWII we rebuilt Western Europe, including Germany and kept the humiliation to a minimum and that created a more peaceful and prosperous Europe. After the cold war, we should have created a new Marshall plan for former Warsaw Pact countries (a mere 350 billion in 1990s money) and sent in European technocrats to help rebuild institutions and Japanese and South Korean planners to help execute industrial policy. Russia then should have been invited into the EU &amp; NATO.","Coercive authority is always more expensive than moral authority. ..In the face of low energy prices, this is what brought down the Soviet Union as it burned rubbles in Afghanistan...I say be patient and give the economic approach time to work. If we don't confront Russian nationalist pride, then it can be satiated. Once that happens, and then they look around and see that there's no food in any of the stores, jobs are gone and another winter is setting in, Putin's goose will be cooked. At that point, if he wants to stay in power he'll have to launch nukes on himself. ..My father used to say, give a person enough rope and they will hang themselves.","The proper response to the end of the cold war would have looked like the response to the end of WWII. A new marshall plan (in 1990, about 330 billion) plus sending East Asian bureaucrats (Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese) to help with economic planning and West European bureaucrats to help with building new institutions and a plan for greater integration with Europe. If we had done that, Russia, Ukraine and the like would all look like Czech, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia now: peaceful, prosperous 1st world countries, integrated with neighbors, with functioning institutions, first rate education and health care, rule of law, and protections for civil rights and liberties. ..Instead we left them with Yeltsen who we sent the Chicago School Neo-Liberal economist who turned Russia and the ex-Soviet countries into a near failed states. (the only true neo-liberal state is Somalia, and Russia was approaching that).  That created the opportunity for the emergence of Putin who wants to turn back the clock to Soviet times. ..The Greatest Generation knew how to win a war. Their children, not so much. The leadership elites from the baby boom generation is nothing more than a bunch of spoiled brat cry babies who have ruined almost everything they have inherited.","Russia's per capita income is still sub first world. Between trade embargoes and redistribution of assets to newly incorporated areas, the per capita income will go down even more. I'm sure the Russians will enjoy that...There isn't a lot of capital floating around Russia, one reason is because property rights are not respected. One day you are a millionaire the next day you money's been confiscated and you're thrown in jail. The trade and investment sanctions will keep money and investors out of Russia...The smart western investors, like Ford, GM and Hyundai should have all of their top machinery put on pallets and ready for extraction. ..Those investors who can, have been served notice, and should be bugging out as fast as their legs can carry them. Putin is an unstable commodity and one shouldn't put assets within his reach unless one can afford the risk of losing them or the value placed in them.","The question shouldn't be whether or not Ukraine should integrate further with Europe, the question should be WHY ISN'T RUSSIA, following Ukraine's lead, PURSUING GREATER INTEGRATION WITH EUROPE? ..Joining the EU means having  a solid 1st class, 1st world existence within 25 years, as happened with the Slavic cousins in Poland, Czech, Slovenia and Slovakia...We are talking fully functioning institutions, peace, prosperity, rule of law, respect of human, civil rights and liberties. Education and health care systems that really work. ..Joining Russia means a millennium of corruption cronyism and dysfunctional institutions.  The broad majority of Ukrainians, including ethnic Russians, want what people in Warsaw and Prague now have.  In fact, so do the ordinary people in Moscow, Volgograd. Ekaterinburg and St. Petersburg. ..Greater integration, along the lines done in Europe is the entire worlds future some day. Integration, peace, prosperity, functioning institutions is what all ordinary people want. Only elites have egos that they want to insert into blocking the process of the future of history. ..The only reason that Russia is not pursuing more integration with Europe is Putin's ego. This is patently stupid on many multiple levels. There is no point to a Russian Eurasian Union other than to perpetuate dysfunction and unnecessary conflict...This is why Ukrainians stood out side 3 solid months in winter to protest the old regime. Its really a no brainer.","Putin is not responsible if people other people are stupid. ..Joining the EU means have a solid 1st world existence within 25 years, as happened to Poland, Czech, Slovenia and Slovakia. ..Joining Russia means a millenium of corruption cronyism and dysfunctional institutions. ..This is why Ukrainians stood out side 3 solid months in winter to protest the old regime. Its really a no brainer.","Just what did George Bush see when he looked into Putin's eyes and saw his soul? ..Apparently we are just now getting some more of the details of what he saw...(Obviously, Bush was looking for an excuse to allow oil prices to rise, of which Russia would be the prime beneficiary, and the original reason oil prices were engineered down to sub 35 a barrel levels.)","In a democracy you have the right to gather on the street and press your demands.  That is written right into our constitution, by the way. ..Ukraine did not experience a coup. It was a street driven popular revolution by ordinary people standing in the streets of a bitterly cold Kiev winter for 3 solid months, because domination by Russia of their country meant perpetual poverty, corruption and dysfunctional institutions and integration with Europe represents the opposite of that...The problem isn't he will of the people, its the ego of Putin and his anachronistic view of geopolitics. Instead of trying to stop Ukraine, Russia should be pursuing greater integration with Europe as well - then the ethnicity inside Ukraine and Crimea would be mute...The European Community is not an ideological or geopolitical construct. It includes neutral nations such as Sweden and Finland. It is an administrative project that brings 1st world functioning institutions to its members, if they happen to have substantial ties to Europe. Russia belongs in Europe as much as Spain, and far more than Malta or Cyprus. Furthermore, every Russian would love to have the deal that ever Pole, Czech, Slovak, and Slovenian now enjoy...The real issue is Putin. ..Keep in mind, that everything said about Crimea can be said about the Kalliningrad Oblast, Russian territory on the Baltic. The only difference is that it's been part of Russia 9 years longer than Crimea was part of Ukraine.","In a democracy you have the right to gather on the street and press your demands.

Look at Poland, Romainia and Bulgaria, they have GNPper capita 3 to 4 times higher than Ukraine and functional, non-corrupt government, judiciary, education, health care and other institutions. If Ukrain could follow Bulgaria they'd become a 1st world nation in less than a generation, complete with freedom and prosperity and functional institutions. ..The problem is how to get there from here. And Putin has just put up a barrier. ..The loan, while it doesn't lasso Ukraine into his orbit, keeps Ukraine from being lassoed by any agency of the west for the time being. If things get better or more desperate, either one will do, then Putin can make his move. ..Overall, I'm happy for the Russians general improvement in their economy, but it looks to be soley based upon raw extraction of raw materials, oil, gas, timber, from the ground, and not a firm foundation for the future. ..Poor Ukraine. Its future, in the current light, is at best, quite dim, and possibly quite dark."

Naturally in Russia where the salaries, pensions and social benefits are higher in few times than in Ukraine that stays at the edge of the state default. Their choice was obvious and could be understood..And what Russia must do? Throwing them out to reject their request or try to help and accept them to federation? Considering that all people who lives in Crimea are not guests on this land..There is no mention in the NYT article. But Putin in his speach said that he had discussion  with Western leaders about Crimea and Kosovo. To compare and as precedent. And Western leaders (he didn't specify who exactly  but in our internet-era it's not problem to find out who it was) said that main difference between Kosovo and Crimea consist in that there were victims in Kosovo and there are not in Crimea... As though the victims are the condition to allow for nation to choice their future in own way.",,,,,,,,,
Susiejoe,,,,"It astounds me how many know what Putin thinks and wants who in fact, haven't a clue. Putin delivers lengthy state of the union addresses every few months and he delivered a particular notable speech at the Valdai conference. If any are seriously interested in what Putin really thinks and wants, I would suggest listening to the man. He is quite open and forthcoming as to what his positions are and why.","Putin and Lavrov understand the history and deeper roots better than any westerner which is why Putin told the EU and US in the beginning that their coup d tat would cause a civil war.  That civil war would have happened regardless of what Putin did. The separatists may have been shut down sooner without outside support, but possibly not. What our pathetic journalists do not cover is the fact that many of the Ukrainian military defected to the separatist side taking their tanks and weapons with them. Every time the separatists win a battle against the Ukrainian military which is deplorable and mainly a bunch of neofascist punksters, they take their tanks and weapons.  Western journalists and politicians do not want to admit the fact that the easterners are kicking the westerners backsides.","Putin has repeatedly been clear. Russia will act in the best interests of protecting its borders, and it will act in protecting Russian ethnics caught in other countries after the fall of the USSR from ethnic cleansing (which is, retaliation for the days of the USSR).  Crimea is Russia's, by history, by population, by religion, by military occupation for over 200 years, by majority vote to self determination. Russia will never give up Crimea without a major fight.  Russian people know economic hardships better than economic good times. That will not budge them off of these positions. If the USEU want to isolate Russia, than that leaves the remainder of the world to do business with.  Nothing complicated to Putin's position nor to solving the problems in the Ukraine with the separatists. ..For the rebels in the east, they have not wanted the whole of Ukraine, only their own right to self determination and picking their own government. That is what the USEU claim to believe in. All they have to do is put their money where their mouths are.","Obama is not a henchman?  Is Putin's record anywhere near that of Obama's drone attacks, most of which are to innocent people, the other questionable?",Gee.  You are only saying what Putin and Lavrow have been arguing for since the coup in February.,"Destabalize the government in Kiev? When was the government in Kiev ever stable, especially the coup government that took charge in February?  Putin could have easily set it all out and let that government do itself in as it is rapidly doing.  It was the people in the east who felt compelled to stand up for their own rights.",,,,

Yurko,,,,"Russia's bullying brings us westerners an uneasy choice. On one hand, we'd like to maintain our safety and prosperity by distancing ourselves from the bullies of such grandeur because they might inflict significant damage in the process of handling their tantrums. On the other hand, as they say in Russia, appetite comes while eating, and today's Ukraine might become tomorrow's Baltic states or any other slice of land up to the one time Russia's Alaska. Putin obviously honors no laws, so Polonium poisoning in Britain may become a reality in the US. In the end, facing a bully is just a matter of time, and appeasement isn't always the best strategy, if ever. A strong democratic Ukraine is a one 45-million West-oriented, freedom-minded multi-ethnic ally with the biggest territory in Europe. We have all the rights and obligations to help Ukraine's people maintain their sovereignty and dignity for the sake of the world's peace and security.","Julia, what do people need? Good education, jobs, justice, freedoms, good health care and care for the elderly and disabled, safety. Russia offers none of those. Russia makes no popular brands of cars, computers, smartphones, medicines - nothing. But Europe and the West do, along with many nations of Asia, notably excluding Russia's most notorious product and ally, North Korea. Julia, you're obviously Russian yet you live in the US, enjoying safety, good roads and freedoms of the Western civilization, while supporting Putin's war to prevent Ukrainians from joining the very world you've immigrated to. Seems quite unfair, isn't it?","You're spreading misinformation. The USSR nuclear stockpile, as well as other armaments, belonged to the subsequently formed independent states in the proportions of their Soviet-time GDP, which Ukraine had the highest second to Russia. While there was a challenge of the strategic missile operations, tactical nuclear warheads could be easily operated by the armies of the independent states. Putin could NEVER attack and invade Ukraine and Georgia should they have kept their tactical nuclear missiles! Thus Budapest Memorandum of Ukraine's non-nuclear status, as predicted by some historians and political analysts, has proven to be disastrous for the world's peace and foremost for the 45-million nation of Ukraine.",Poroshenko's guilt is simply playing by the rules of the international law; that's where Putin is clearly a winner: he doesn't care.

Russia's oligarchs are not interested in such scenario, as Putin's land grabs are becoming increasingly costly for their fortunes.","Ukraine is a nation of some 45 million people that has little oil, gave away nukes in 1994, never invaded any country, is now under a brutal invasion of a hybrid nature, which involves local militants supplied and controlled by Russia, Russian citizens armed and trained by Russia to volunteer in offensive against Ukraine, and Russian armed forces and operatives. Ukraine has been shelled by the heaviest artillery and rockets from both Russias territory and within the Russia-occupied territory of East Ukraine.  All the instances of Russias aggression are well documented and confirmed, including the downing of the civilian airliner MH17. The problem is, Russia seems as too big of a bully to try to deter from the blatant violations of the international laws and to prosecute Kremlin for its many crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine, Georgia, and Chechnya. So, the question is, are Ukrainians going to stand on their own against Russias overwhelming force? Are we back to 1939 when appeasing Hitler led to the greatest genocide and destruction in the history of the humanity?

Mike 71,,,,"Between 1861 and 1865, the U.S. also faced a separatist movement intended to retain the institution of slavery. That war resulted in an estimated 750,000 American casualties on both sides. As in the American Civil War, Ukraine is entitled to act in the interest of both national defense and defense of territorial integrity, to use military force against those seeking to dismember, or seize parts of the nation. Such Russian behavior is not unprecedented; it occurred elsewhere in Georgia and elsewhere. ..Not all of the 5,000 casualties cited were the result of Ukrainian defense; many are attributable to aggression, such as the recent rocket attacks on the.port of Mariupol, which resulted in over 60 civilian casualties...In addition to economic sanctions, the U.S. and NATO are entitled to provide Ukraine the weaponry necessary for that nation's defense against Russian supported separatists and aggression. It appears that Russia has no regrets over its breach of the Budapest Memorandum, under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear forces, in exchange fro guarantees of its territorial integrity. Perhaps, Mr. Putin's toady in the U.K. should be grateful that no one is advocating restoration of Ukraine's nuclear deterrent!","The best thing that Putin can do to restore American and European friendship and advance world peace would be to withdraw all Russian and separatist forces from Ukraine...In 1861, 13 American states, in defense of the institution of slavery,  asserted the right to secede, leading to the most destructive war on American soil, killing an estimated 750,000. In the wake of that war, until the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, African-Americans were second-class citizens. Perhaps, you seek return to that era when African-Americans were 35ths of a person under the Constitution and in the words of the Dred Scott decision, had no rights white Americans were obligated to respect...I doubt that many Americans would willingly revert to that type of society; I doubt that many Ukrainians would willingly accept that either!","Israel has been silent and remains uncritical of the Soviet  .  .  .  oops, Russian annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. Israel does not threaten Putin's Russia, which makes this assertion patently ill informed and inane. While NATO has recently stationed forces in the Baltic states, including Poland, a former Soviet key ally of the Warsaw Pact Era, it has no forces stationed in Israel. The primary threat to Israel lies across the Persian Gulf, not on the Russian - Ukrainian border!  ..While Israel has earlier generation F-15 and F-16 aircraft, and is scheduled to acquire the newest generation F-35, the I.D.F. Air Force is the most skilled in the region and capable of meeting the nation's defense needs, as illustrated in the recent Hamas initiated Third Gaza War. As with the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and other U.N. nation-state members, Article 51 of the United Nations Charter recognizes an inherent right to individual, or collective self-defense, a right invoked by Israel in numerous defensive wars of necessity! With over a million Russian immigrants to Israel, Israel remains on good terms with Russia; the primary threats to Israel lie elsewhere!","Isn't Mr. Putin appealing to Russian nationalism in arguing that he must invade Crimea to protect ethnic Russians, irrespective of whether they are Russian citizens? Someone made similar arguments about protecting ethnic Germans in the Czech Sudetenland in 1938. While many ethnic Russian Ukrainians may not have sanctioned the revolution, many other Ukrainians, outraged by Yanukovych's blatant kleptocracy and misrule, did. Does Mr. Putin accurately perceive the revolution as a threat to his autocratic rule of Russia? No doubt, he does! The same principles of Peace, Order and Good Government, which obtain in Ms. Freeland's native country, Canada, have a way of spreading eastward, as they had since the end of the Cold War!..Mr. Putin has legitimate interests in maintaining Russian naval bases in Crimea, Russia's only warm water port, as extended by treaty until 2024, but his interests do not extend into the interior of Ukraine. He may have won in the short term, but ultimately Ukrainians will demand a better standard of living and more open society than Putin's Russian kleptocracy is capable of providing.","Tom, your first four paragraphs made excellent sense before you went totally off the rails. What was wrong with a democratic led military alliance, such as NATO, expanding toward a democratic Russia? How does that constitute a threat? If you have ever studied history, you would be aware that democracies rarely, if ever, launch wars against other democracies!..I totally agree with your viewpoint on not going to war with Russia and that economic sanctions are far more appropriate, particularly in light of the 60 Billion losses in Russian markets following this ill considered move. But wouldn't we be punishing ourselves for this Russian faux-pas by raising the gas tax, just like Jimmy Carter did in re-instituting draft registration after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979?..Just because Mr. Putin makes a serious miscalculation, does not require the U.S. to follow suit, but we did do exactly that in Afghanistan, didn't we?

nikolai burlakoff,,,,"What your article fails to consider is, that the real fight is about who gets stuck with the Ukraine bill. Mr. Putin has no desire to pay out 100 billion dollars, or so, to save Ukraine from its own mismanagement. Neither US nor EU want that either. Since Russia refuses to be drawn into a US induced war, and Europe has finally proposed a road map that could resolve the situation (which was accepted by Russia), we have a situation where the US has to fish or cut bait...As long as Russia's bottom line is met--no NATO on Ukrainian soil--and that is guaranteed by the structure of the Ukrainian state, it may take on some of the cost by offering, once again, gas discounts. Otherwise, it stands ready to play the spoiler role in any arrangement that the West may dream-up.","I do not believe that Obama has any interest in resolving the situation.

It is also ironic that the New York Times, which for much of the recent past has led a vigorous and sustained campaign o calumny in regards to President Putin and Russia, has finally admitted that the country and its president may have valid national interests that may be at odds with current American policy views.  Perhaps, it was Ambassador Metcalf's upbraiding of Secretary Kerry in a recent article for unnecessarily harsh and undiplomatic language that has given pause to the Times' own expressions. In any case case, this is a refreshing departure from the drumbeat that helped the war in Iraq become a reality.","Since the whole Ukraine situation would not have occurred had the US not funded the initial subversion of the Ukrainian government (if we are to believe Ms. Nuland), to blame Putin is silly. Since Ukraine is currently broke, the only way it can continue military operations against its own people is with EU and American help. So, to blame Putin for support of the anti-Kiev forces is also unproductive. While the benefit to Russia of cessation of hostilities is obvious, there is no benefit to the US whose whole aim is to first, destabilize Ukraine, and then Russia. The hostilities therefore, will continue till the current Ukrainian government falls. It is doubtful that, in any case, the EU or US will provide the needed funds to recovery of Ukraine's economy, consequently it will fail or fall back into Russia's sphere of influence.","When the NYT writes: ... it seemed unlikely that Mr. Putins congratulatory statement to the separatists would assuage anger toward him, one wonders whose anger is the sentence referring to? True, in the latest Levada polls in Russia, the anti Putin sentiment has risen to 15, and his approval rating dropped 3.  Now it hovers around the 84 positive. On the other hand Obama's polls are 53 negative and 41 positive. I can't help wondering whose electorate is more happy with their choice in the last election, and their president's policies?","One of the more tiresome aspect of much of recent anti-Russian speculation regarding purported designs on Ukraine is the absence of a factual basis for it. Mr. Cohen writes, There is every reason to believe he Putin has designs on all Ukraine. That assertion is followed by a host of unverified statements, most based on claims by the Ukrainian side, which historically have not withstood close scrutiny. ..It appears that few authors who make claims of Russia's designs on Ukraine give any thought as to possible motives for such aspirations. Why would Russia, a country with a host of challenges, want a huge bankrupt territory with a population that has been raised in anti-Russian rhetoric for more than two decades? Germany barely managed to survive its reunification, and both sides wanted that reunion...The thought has occurred to me, that perhaps some in the West actually want Russia to take Ukraine, so that its problems would become Russia's problems. I have full faith, that President Putin would prefer to let  the champions of the recent government of Ukraine be tasked with paying for its support. Dumb, Putin is not.","Ukraine, NATO, and the Obama Administration have been predicting a Russian invasion since April, usually, however, it was said to be aimed at Kiev. For the first time, a more realistic direction for the purported invasion has been found, although the likelihood of it is probably as high as the WMDs of the Bush Administration. ..But, I can understand Obama's and NATO's fear of humanitarian aid, given that the their humanitarian aid in Serbia and Libya was bombing, and in Syria training of democratic forces included ISIS elements. I believe that the West actually wants Russia to invade, so that they do not have to face the costs of helping Ukraine after breaking it.  Doubt that Putin would let the regime changers off that easy.","If this story is correct, and little that has to do with Russia has been recently, then we merely have a more honest expression of a policy that has been de-facto anti-Russian from the start of the Administration.  The naivete of President Obama's assertion that President Medvedev was the future of Russia, while Putin was the past, was only reinforced by the appointment of one of the more disastrous ambassadors--Michael McFaul, or the inexcusable goof of the restart button...America prides itself at convincing 100 member states of the UN to vote for the recent Ukrainian resolution. Ignored, is the fact that 95 members, either voted against, or failed to support it. At the UN, those numbers have been noted...If we look at the overall effectiveness of Obama's policy,  we see: 1) Crimea as part of Russia, 2) Ukraine is a mess that will cost the West, at least 100 billion to stabilize, 3) Armenia scheduled to sign the Customs Union agreement, 4) Georgia talking of more peaceful relations, 5) Russia and China signing an agreement to trade in rubles and yuan, and abandoning the dollar, 6) Putin gaining the highest poll numbers of his presidency, 7) Russia and Russians feeling proud of their country, for the first time in more than 2 decades. Whose policy is ahead?..A tougher approach, will merely engender tougher responses. Is it any wonder that the Russians speak of the current foreign policy as one of dilettantism?","Todays vote in the Crimean Republic is a resounding defeat for the neo-con faction that has controlled American foreign policy for some time. Hard at work, since before the 2004 Orange Revolution, the five billion dollar investment, according Asst. Secretary of State Nuland, to create this crisis, has ended-up with a broke and broken Ukraine, and enhanced stature for Vladimir Putin within his own country...How serious a setback this fiasco is for the US, will be indicated by the sanctions imposed. The total humiliation of American foreign policy will favor a reflexive response of harsh sanctions. Too harsh a response, unfortunately for the United States, will only deepen the present defeat...Meanwhile, the EU and US have inherited a 100 billion dollar problem for the next five years. ..Too bad that America never learned the old Russian proverb: Dont spit in the well, you may want to take a drink.",

How about telling the world who murdered 298 people on the Malaysian airline. He knows who and when the trigger was pulled. I don't understand why the world is giving him a pass on this issue. Lie cheat and stone wall just like the Russian did on the 1983 murder of the people on the Korean airline until Boris Yeltsin revealed everything 10 years  after he fact..,"The sanction are nothing but bluster. One thing that Putin feels is a bad economy. And what do we do: US corporations have invested billions in developing his oil exports, Grumman-Lockheed can not fly missiles without Russian rocket motors and so is NASA. Putin can walk with a swagger because he knows we depend on his country and their raw material for all kinds of products. Even our national defense depends on him to make our missiles fly. What kind of idiots are we governed by???",Putin stated CRIME (A) has always been an integral part of Russia in the hearts and minds of people with millions of peole murdered throughout their history. That for sure is absolutely true.,Putin is running circles around Obama. So now Russia is telling US forces to stay out of the way of Syria because Putin is now doing what our military should be doing. How pathetic is the Obama administration???.,"To reduce tension Putin could start resolving the murder of the 298 passengers on the Malaysian airliner last summer over Ukraine. He knows who, when and where the trigger was pulled. This is the same criminal behavior Russia displayed when the Korean airliner was shot down in 1983. Putin is waiting for one of his bomber to be shot down then all hell will break loose.  Putin suffers from incredible inferior complex toward the rest of the world.

"Prof.Jai Prakash Sharma,",,,,"While defending the West against Russia on the Ukraine centric  crisis not only the NYTimes editorial is being partisan and one sided in its presentation of events that led to the crisis but also projecting Putin as the main villain of the whole drama of the cold war vintage. While fact is that since the build up of whole crisis Russia has always been reactive to the Western moves and machinations aimed at turning Ukraine away from Russia and bring the former under the Western alliance and facilitate entry into NATO. It was after several warnings that Russia ultimately turned aggressive on Ukraine.  So is when the US led West is planning to strengthen NATO on the Russian borders that Putin is trying to flex muscle. If the West could retain its spheres of influence or NATO,  wouldn't Russia do whatever it could to defend its borders and interests?","In the face of Putin's aggression if, Ukraine survives as a nation, at war with itself,  of course, but also hopeful for resolving the conflict in near future,  the credit goes to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel who boldly initiated sanctions against Russia,  and later on the Minsk agreement with her deft diplomatic handling of the entire explosive situation, and paved the way for seeking a negotiated resolution of the complex Ukrainian crisis. There's no need to flex the NATO muscle to bring Putin to senses, for with all his provocative actions and nationalistic assertions over Crimea, he himself would avoid a situation of direct military confrontation with Europe,  the main trading partner of Russia. To conclude, the frozen conflict situation of Ukraine is far preferable to an all out war and resulting disintegration of a nation with great potential yet to be realised.",As a former KGB chief Putin too has learned a lesson or two from the West to overcome his isolation and boycott by the latter and pay them back in their own coin.,"Despite recent military build up by Russia  in Syria, and several doubts about Putin's real motives, the glimmer of hope appears to be his willingness for seeking a negotiated resolution of the Syrian crisis. With leveraging his recent diplomatic success on securing the nuclear deal with Iran, President Obama should readily grab another opportunity that has opened up in Syria by engaging Putin for talks on seeking solution to the Syrian crisis in which Iran could also play a facilitator. For, unless the two sides- the USWest and regional forces, and Russia- come round the negotiations no lasting solution could be found for the Syrian problem.","The Russian move to seek larger military presence in Syria is guided by twin motives- first, not to allow the Western military effort go unchallenged and be an indispensable part of the outcome of the Syrian crisis; and second, protect Assad with a diversionary cover of war against the ISIS to be waged through an international alliance under the UN watch. The unveiling of this Syrian plan at the UN forum is nothing short of a master diplomatic stroke dealt by Putin,  which the US and its Western allies too would find it difficult to spurn, and shouldn't be done so as the anti-Islamic state fight is the point both the sides do agree on,  and there's perhaps global consensus also on this. The only sticking point is Assad,  which could be thrashed out in due course,  once Obama and Putin agree to give a start to the process of finding diplomatic political solution to the Syrian crisis as against the confrontational course of no result. Whatever misgivings and hiccups on the part of Obama about Putin, he should seize the moment to have diplomatic engagement with Putin in the larger interests of global peace, as also to end the humanitarian catastrophe in SyriaIraq.","The Russian move to seek larger military presence in Syria is guided by twin motives- first, not to allow the Western military effort go unchallenged and be an indispensable part of the outcome of the Syrian crisis; and second, protect Assad with a diversionary cover of war against the ISIS to be waged through an international alliance under the UN watch.

The Syrian autocrat Bashar al-Assad and the Russian President Putin instead of trying to show solidarity with each other rather listen to what their people want to convey.,"However mixed motivations Putin might have on Syria or more interested he might be to save Assad than to fight the Islamic State terror,  to the extent he's prepared to seek diplomatic solution involving international alliance under the UN aegis, what objection the US or its WesternMiddleeast allies could have on the Russian President Putin's plan on Syria, he's likely to present to the UN shortly? For, despite sharp differences on continuation of the Assad regime between the US West and RussiaIran, there's at least a clear convergence on fighting the Islamic State menace, a priority for the US. The crux of the matter is that unless the US and Russia together come on board,  there's practically no lasting solution to the Syrian crisis, as the proxy forces led by the two sides would continue to fight the civil war as dictated by their respective patrons, shedding blood of the innocents and forcing millions to flee.","Putin's irrepressible neo-colonial quest to carve out a small Russian enclave out of independent Ukraine seems odd in post-colonial times, and perhaps unsustainable too for long."
Steen,,,,"Putin's speech at the economic forum was one out of pure desperation. He knows fully well that if the Russian economy keeps tanking people will start blaming him, and rightfully so..Pride and patriotism doesn't advance the economy or put food on the table and a lot of Russians are slowly starting to realize that. ..Spending whatever money he has on nuclear weapons truly will be self defeating. Putin is unwilling to understand that NATO is not a prerequisite to the former Soviet countries if they wanted to deal with the West. These countries did it out of distrust to their former dictator in the Kremlin. If you truly want the NATO on your door step Mr. Putin keep doing what you are doing in Ukraine. ..And one more thing. You said that you are against intervening or meddling in another sovereign such as Syria or Iraq. Pardon me but just what on earth is then happening in Kiev!?",Dear John..Just where did you read that Russia is EVIL or that the Putin's action in Crimea was TERROR?..Must be the same news cast that tells you Ukraine will be the next member of NATO and European Union...You must realize that even though not all news channels in the West are unbiased we do have more than one mouth piece are better informed news wise (for the most part at least) to make an informative opinion based on a free press. This kind freedom in Russia Putin knows would be the end of his reign as he knows it.,"Russia annexes Crimea - illegally and against all international protocols and laws. Had Putin's ego and Russia's nationalistic chest banging stopped here the situation would have more manageable - but no. ..Russia's euphoria got the better of it and wanted more. Putin then intervene  in the sovereign country of Ukraine supplying the rebels with Russian soldiers and military equipment. The West says Stop and impose financial sanctions on Russia who for good measure cut of their own food imports...The icing on the cake is that now the Western powers are the Bad Guys for intervening in Russia's affairs. ..I'm sorry, but am I missing something here!?",I read that there are a lot of Putin admires who believe a stable Bashar Assad is the solution. Obviously not a single one have paid attention to the hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Syria. If stability means gassing your own people and causing this kind of human exodus then I'm missing something - which I'm sure I am not!..Simply deposing Assad will stabilize Syria just as much getting rid of the Hussein (who also gassed his own people) stabilized Iraq. ..Only by supporting a legitimate opposition to Assad and helping Syria with a democratic nation building will we see stability. Sorry Putin but you can for obvious reasons be of no help here. ..Mr. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon the world needs your help.,"Some not well thought through comments here about how sanctions will teach Putin a lesson. ...hammer the economy and ...clear the shelves of food. ..Communism died of old age and not because of sanctions. The Russian people are extremely resilient and it is nave to think that hitting the stock market and using less oil and gas will change Putin's politics. ..A few facts from an expat who has lived in Russia for close to 20 years. Putin will look stronger in the eyes of the Russians if he stands up to sanctions. Freezing individual Russian bank accounts in the West and Putin will seized Western assets in Russia in retribution, gas and oil supplies will be cut off and the losers are - you guess it NOT the corrupt politicians or oligarchs, but the man on the street in both the East and the West..Now trying to find a solution to the Syrian crises and Iran's nuclear program will become near impossible. Is an unstable Syria and Iran worth it all. ..Hammer Russia's politics in the all international organizations and kick them out of the rest like the G8. Then you take him to all the international courts to show that the referendum was a hoax and illegal.","Putin you shelter the coward and murderer Viktor Yanukovych who killed close to 100 of his own people. (Had these victims been Crimean citizens by the way you would have invaded Ukraine all together.) Then you do not recognize the interim government that is in the process of establishing a Democratically elected government. ..If you sincerely wanted to get the Crimean Peninsula back all you had to do is play by the rules of the civilized world - fair elections and fair referendums and Crimea would be Russian again tomorrow. This Mr. Putin is how power, prestige and respect is won. If you do not comprehend he world's disrespect for how you have handled this situation you have an even more serious problem on your hand.",,,,

No.,"McCain said he felt that the United States has an obligation to protect American lives. I believe the president is taking the correct action, said McCain, (although) I hope that our Marines will be out of there very soon.   -  AP article in the Kingman Daily Miner, Wednesday, October 26. 1983...This was during Reagan's invasion of Grenada, which, in my opinion, was just as bogus as Putin's invasion of Ukraine...If McCain was a Russian, he would be backing Putin just as vocally as he backed Reagan...Instead, as a supposed American, he bashes President Obama in a NYT op-ed column...The man has no decency for the office of the president if the president is not a member of his political party.","Dennis,.By your logic you would support Iran, Iraq, Saudia Arabia, ... sending troops into Russia to protect the Muslims there that are being persecuted by Putin...Glad I do not have to live in Russia like you do (assuming you are in St. Pete Russia not Florida).

'This is no time for that,' the GOP presidential nominee said at the time, adding that Americans should be united against Russia.

Christine McMorrow,,,,"But the Americans were still left trying to fathom Mr. Putins intentions and wonder whether he could be pressed into being a more constructive player on Syria as they said he was during the Iran negotiations...Trying to fathom? Putin has been pretty clear on his goals both short and long-term.  He wants to be a superpower and meddle wherever he chooses, often causing skirmishes and Russian-made crises in Ukraine to increase his leverage and power over other world powers...I have no problem with Mr. Obama talking IF--and this is a big IF--he knows what his goals are for the meeting.  Trying to negotiate with Putin is like negotiating with a cobra.  The only way I see a conversation with Putin proving fruitful is if the President, with his advisors, decides what his terms are to use the conversation as a springboard for making them clear.  Of course, with his history of red lines in Syria, Putin would probably just dismiss whatever the President said as malleable...I'm of two minds.  Back in the Cold War, Kennedy used to meet with Kruschev but he was clear about his redlines.  Summits usually produced nothing, but they did reinforce US resolve.  So I guess I ultimately feel talking to Putin might be productive--but only if our resolve is set, clear, and unmistakable.","Two weeks ago, The Times of London reported on a meeting between Russian generals and American officials in which the Russians threatened a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military if NATO moved more military forces into the Baltic States...Toward the end of this editorial, it warns, it becomes increasingly difficult to predict Mr. Putins next move...No, it doesn't.  It's very easy to predict or watch Putin's next move.  He will move on, country by country, waving his weapons and daring NATO to respond.  He wants to restore the former Russian map of the 50s, including Poland, which is dreading a weekend motorcycle run by Putin-backed thugs who are likely to offer a show of force as if to say, Poland soon we'll own you again...And until he is stopped, he will continue.  With all the hand-wringing on Iran and the state of its nuclear program, nobody  seems to be minding the store on this proud, KGB-trained, Russian relic.  Putin has all the youth, vigor, paranoia, and strong nuclear arsenal he needs to wreak havoc on a weakened Euro-Zone and a United States--which is fighting so many battles (literal and diplomatic) on so many fronts that it risks missing Putin's continued drive-by shows of force into Western territories.","@Carolyn: I'm sitting in my office in Waltham writing a post that very few will see.  I hardly think my thoughts are fueling needless wars.  And I hardly think that my thoughts are important enough to affect the discussion.   I'm merely reporting my thoughts from a variety of articles I've read recently because of the fear Poles have about this cycle ride through their territory.  ..We have plenty of neo-cons in this country that will be willing to add Putin to their war wish list.  And from your post, you sound more like you're justifying Putin's aggression.   NATO only moved there because of Crimea, to protect the post-Soviet area map that Putin wishes to redraw.","I actually agree with this column except for the gratuitous crack about Mr. Obama's alleged navet about Putin.  (I seriously doubt anyone who came of age in Chicago can't recognize a thug when he sees one)...But Mr. Douthat displays a good blend of realpolitik here, essentially affirming we would do well to recognize and capitalize on both our strengths and weaknesses when it comes to Russian aggression, including potential moves beyond Crimea...Just as Mr. Putin shouldn't be underestimated, nor should we.   Just as we shouldn't assume Russia holds the upper hand now, we shouldn't believe we have no hand at all to play...I'm sure there will be much hand writing, particularly by McCain and Graham, on tomorrow's talk shows.  But as I've said before here, I feel much safer with Mr. Obama's innate caution and unemotional analytical mind than I do any saber rattlers that for too long dominated American foreign policy.","The Obama administration should focus on supporting Kiev rather than punishing Moscow...Well, then, what's our response when Russia gets enraged at that support, continues its path of massing troops near the UkraineCrimea border, and makes good on a possible goal of annexing a few cities to ensure Russia a neat pathway to the sea?  ..The author here first chides Mr. Obama for his empty threats, but the praises him for his innate caution and instincts not to get militarily engaged.  He states Russia should not be treated as a rogue state (yet) but then suggests that Mr. Obama find a way to be stronger?..It appears to be a catch 22.  For his critics, Mr. Obama can't be strong enough and he shouldn't be as strong in his words and deeds.  Which is it, folks?  We know Russia is right now not posing a threat to the US, but Poland and other NATO nations are quaking in their boots right now given Russia's historical expansionist actions...It's unclear to me just how much of a threat Putin is.  The President calls Russia a regional power, but from this article that regional power wields a pretty hefty economic weight.  Sort of like the hold Arab oil producers had over us for decades until our recent strides towards energy independence. ..One thing remains clear: whatever the President does, or doesn't do, he will never satisfy his critics.","I think Putin has blown his chance to try to mold an image of a new type of Russian leadership, more technocratic, more integrated with the world in his pursuit of resurrecting the glory of pre-Communist Russia while holding on to many of their tactics...A thug is a thug is a thug.  I always predicted he was just another Russian despot in the wings, despite his cozy relationship with Merkel and graceful appearances in international events...Russia has been stirring up the pot and now they have an international incident to account for.  The best way to do so would be to rein in this stupid war, which I just don't think will happen.  Far easier to blame the US, and Mr. Obama who he hates  just as much as conservatives, for his own problems...And here at home, please, McCain, I wish you would just shut up.  In a world of rising tensions, the knee-jerk responses to every move by the President as crises we have little control over, erupt all over the globe.  It's annoying and unseemly, and just as infuriating as Mr. Cheney trying justify the worst foreign policy blunder in a 100 years by slamming Mr. Obama's handling of middle eastern meltdowns.","This situation has been a total outrage since it occurred.  And the only persons exploiting the disaster in pursuit of mercenary political goals' are Mr. Putin and his self-created Russian separatist strongman in Ukraine.  ..They are attached at the hip, and any denial from Putin that they aren't needs to be challenged with strong actions by the entire European community, working closely with the US.  Putin's strategy of denial, obfuscation, delay, and blame has gotten very old.  ..I don't know whether Mr. Putin's end game is domination of all Europe, or just this piecemeal meddling in Ukraine, which could be the first of many places he wants to bring back to Mother Russia.  I'm not sure he knows either, as some in the media have pointed out that he's a brilliant on tactics but not on strategy...I wouldn't be too sure.  I think, like many thugs and dictators, he's only concerned with power: its acquisition, its expansion, and its defense, no matter how many words are wasted as he stalls for time to figure where he wants to go next.","I hate to say Romney was right on anything, but he sure nailed it with identification of Putin as one of the most serious threats facing US foreign policy...This sly, manipulative strategy is going uncontested while American worries about the far more visible threat of ISIS.  But what will it do when Putin's series of land grabs result in a de facto rebuilding of Cold War Russia?  What will America do when land grabs advance beyond countries with strong Russian heritage to include former Soviet occupied countries like Poland?  ..The problem with a series little land grabs is sooner or later, like the plate of brownies everybody is tasting, is one day the world wakes up and finds the map has been redrawn yet again.  ..I know the State Department has a ton on its plate, but it's insouciance toward Putin's call for a Russian-sponsored summit to resolve a problem of its own making is alarming.  When has Putin every convened any alleged discussion it hasn't already won by default?","Until this catastrophe, Putins calculations were pretty good in terms of being able to win any tactical battle, Mr. Petrov said...In watching these events unfold, I've heard more than once that Putin is an excellent tactitian but a dismal strategist.  I would add to that that he's sort of a schizoid personality--shrewd and calculating but extremely delusional.  ..I'm not sure anybody will every really know what's in Putin's mind, but it's clear the world is far different from the 50's standoff between West and East.  It will be hard for Putin to isolate Russia, using the West as scapegoat, now that the genie of globalization and instant communications is out of the box.  No matter how hard he cracks down internally to bolster his dreams of Russian grandeur, Russians today are far more savvy about what's in their best interest...For now, the grumblings are just from some investors and policy critics.  But once the effects of sanctions hit the average Russian, I think Putin's popularity will evaporate as quickly as a rain puddle in July.   ..He's playing the same game as Russia always has: isolating the populace with fear and hatred of outsiders.  But, today, who is an outsider?","it is time for Europe to hold Mr. Putin to his words...With all due respect to the Times Editorial Board, the time for Europe to hold Mr. Putin to his words has been missed over and over.   ..Many great historians, from ancient times to today, conclude that most wars are fought because of economics not ideology.  Even the Great Cold War was, in the end, a battle of economic systems...Thus, people vote and act according to their pocketbooks and Europe is no exception.  With the EU diminishing the power of individual nationalism, while not yet a cohesive economic unit with all states working in tandem, Russia is in the catbird seat.  Putin know it, and so does the world...And in a highly ironic mode, the US and Russia share many commonalities in that their economies are rife with an increasingly potent oligarchies(many of whom evade taxes by offshoring money) who calls the  shots in politics, and in policy decisions...The exploding situation in Ukraine is following a very familiar script.  While Europe and the West in general watches events unfold, let's not forget the power of money that's dictating the next steps."
Barry Schreibman,,,,"Mr. Cohen, as much as I respect you and your writing (which is a lot), I really think you've misunderstood Putin and Putinism.  You're looking at a thief through a cultural prism.  Putin and Putinism are about saying and doing anything that comes to hand in order to preserve a kleptocracy. You are missing the improvisational, opportunistic nature of Putin's actions and ideology.  Blow up some Moscow apartment buildings (with the people in them) and blame it on the Chechens in order to start the Chechen war that first cemented Putin's hold on power?  Not a problem.  Our KGB boy could (and did) do that.  Start another war in Ukraine to distract the Russian people from the unraveling of the Russian economy when the price of oil slips?  Again, just in a day's work for Vlad and his cronies.  Ditto all this cultural stuff:  the alliance with the Orthodox church, the dusting off of Stalin, the gay bashing, ad nauseum. Whatever it takes so that Putin and his cronies can keep on stealing with both hands -- that's what Putin will do. The good news is the flip side. This bizarre amalgam of extreme nationalism and Stalinism is unlikely to long last after Putin's fall -- which is coming.  The tyrant is clever -- but increasingly desperate. And he is on the wrong side of history.","Its time to get real over Putin. He has not poured tanks and multiple-launch rocket systems over the Ukrainian border because he is about to settle for anything less than a weak Ukraine ... .  Spot on, Mr. Cohen.  Thank you. Facts on the ground are the only diplomacy the tyrant Putin will respond to. Stop his tanks. Destroy his rocket emplacements.  Then he'll talk. Otherwise, iPutin will respond the same way Stalin responded when asked if the Pope's moral condemnation bothered him. Stalin replied:  How many divisions does the Pope have?","Obama has it right. For those of you out there with doubts, and to paraphrase Bill Clinton:  It's the shoulder-fired missiles, stupid.  Where do you think the separatists got this sophisticated, very expensive weapons system which they have now used twice to bring down Ukrainian military helicopters, killing around 50 men and women? From the corner hardware store?  And who do you think is firing them -- some alcoholic rube from a provincial town?  Here's a hint: a highly trained Russian solider under direct orders form the highest Russian authority is pulling the trigger. And the last time he did so was on the SAME DAY Putin was talking peace.","If you want to change someone's aggressive behavior -- particularly the aggressive behavior of a totalitarian tytrant like Putin -- you have to put him at risk. There's no other way.  Every time Kiev's brave soldiers make some progress in reclaiming the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia, Russia overwhelms them with fresh armored assaults and devastating rocket fire. Javelin shoulder-fired missiles stop tanks. Advanced counter battery radar pinpoints rocket emplacments. These weapons would put Putin at risk. Give Kiev's soldiers a fighting chance. Defeat of the  Ukrainian people by the tyrant Putin would be a catastrophe for freedom and democracy.","The very able Ukrainian Prime Minister said all that needs to be said: There are Russian boots on Ukrainian ground. This means that Russia has invaded Ukraine. And still, our President dithers.  Barack Obama. Our new Chamberlin.  The only correct analysis is to consider what happens to the post-Cold War order if Putin gets away with this, as he appears to be doing. The Munich analogy is overused. But it fits here. Hitler got away with it for as long as he did because, like Putin, he had correctly assessed the weakness of his enemies. He knew they wouldn't fight, and for a long time they didn't. The Ukrainians need a lot of help: financing to stave off bankruptcy, energy to keep the lights on this winter, political support. But right now what they need most of all is guns and bullets. Save Ukraine from dismemberment or we are all in trouble from a invigorated, reckless reincarnation of Joseph Stalin who famously, when informed of the Vatican's moral disapproval, asked How many divisions does the Pope have?","Obama and the EU should stop dithering,call an invasiobn and invasion, supply the Ukrainians with effective anti-tank weapons, and get on with it. The Ukrainians had to retreat in front of the Russian offensive because they had nothing with which to stop their tanks. Give them the wherewithal to stop the tanks. Putin is not going to stop. Stop him in Ukraine or fight him in the Baltics -- which are next with their 25 Russian-speaking populations.",,,,
Richard A. Petro,,,,"Institutionalized corruption is Putin's thing..Wait, did the Russian equivalent of SCOTUS legalize bribery much like ours did just in time for this country's presidential race? I guess the billion bucks offered by the Koch Brothers is legal and Ms. Clinton's shenanigans with The Foundation are the way democracy works..This country had it's chance with Russia in 1989 and instead of extending them a hand', we laughed at them..Mr. Putin is the result as the Russian people have their pride and remember very well any insults..We shall reap what we have sowed, or didn't, and history tells me the only counter to a strong Russia is a strong Germany. Anything less and Mr. Putin knows he will win this one.","Dear Mr. Foxall,.Crimea matters..Indeed but it seems to matter most to the European Union, as it always has historically. I am not quite sure what you are proposing beyond sanctions..Halting the growth of a Russian regime are very bold words; it seems you are proposing military action to prevent Ukraine from being swallowed up by the new Czar. If so, is Europe ready to go to the mat in a showdown with the Russian state?.If not, then it seems your rhetoric wants the United States to become the area's police force; sort of like Europe's war, American soldiers fighting it..Historically, it seems Mr. Putin is trodding down a well worn path with Ukraine the next stop..Let's try to look at the bright side; Mr. Putin pales in comparison to Mr. Stalin. Not much comfort but a tiny step in the right direction..Meanwhile, how about a well armed Poland and Germany?","Nothing to see here, everybody just move along. Officer Barbrady, South Park.Mr. Friedman, I suggest you begin reading Stephen Kotkin's book Stalin and start reading it quickly as the invasion season in Eurasia is just around the corner. If you do read it, you'll see that old adage of history repeats itself writ quite large..Lenin was a revolutionary with one goal; dictatorial power disguised as Communism (much like all men are created equal democracy while still embracing slavery). Josef Stalin consolidated and protected this concept falling apart only after his death. Then follows a string of, generally, not so great dictators with the final 1989 collapse and the rise of a strongman..Hauntingly familiar ground when it comes to Russian history..At least Mr. Putin hasn't started calling himself Czar Vlad the First but I'll bet he stands up at the part in the 1812 Overture when the tune of Hail to the Czar is played in the climax of that piece..If Mr. Putin wants to invade, who's going to stop him? He DOES have WMD''s and delivery systems for same. He DOES have a chip on his shoulder and he must be reasonably certain that no Western Power wants to start WW3 over Ukraine..Read history, sit back and watch it unfold as there is really, really nothing that can stop him without full blown conflict. T-90 tanks can crush sanctions any day of the week.","..as it becomes increasingly difficult to predict Mr. Putin's next move..If history tells me anything, since our intelligence community apparently can't, Ukraine, or a good part thereof, will be the next area where ethnic Russians are being oppressed and Mr. Putin will be sending in his well armed proxies to save them..It's logical, easy to do (Just keep walking or driving West and there you are, in the Ukraine) and has been a venue for Russian leaders since there's been Russian leaders. Though he could pull an old switcheroo and start agitating in the Baltics, another area of great, historical Russian interest..In any case, is Europe ready to finally have World War 3? The 20 year or so war cycle established in the last century is way out of kilter due to nuclear weapons. Mr. Putin won't, most likely, have to use them but if he were to vaporize a Danish patrol boat, what then?.Unlike Mr. Hussein and the like, Mr. Putin owns WMD's and the delivery systems; his forces are no Republican Guards and I'm sure even G.W. Bush would have paused before invading Russia a country with a real army and, apparently, a real attitude..In essence, Mr. Putin knows he can literally get away with murder (The airliner shoot down) and nothing but sanctions will be the result..Perhaps talking to the fellow versus snubbing him might be a start but, in any case, if he moves in either area, what will the West really do? What can they do?","You are absolutely correct except you are arming the wrong people..Historically, and currently, the only thing standing between Russia and the rest of Europe is not Ukraine nor Poland for that matter; it's Germany..Forget The Land Where the Iron Crosses Grow; from Crimea to the Ukraine is Russian turf and will become Mr. Putin's legacy as he follows an almost historical drive to incorporate both into greater Russia. Arming Ukranians will do nothing to stop this; perhaps delay it a bit and make lots of money for Western Arms Dealers..A strong, well armed and well backed Germany is this crisis's red line . Let Mr. Putin have the territories he wants; all that will happen, as in the past, is a smoldering, long term, guerilla style war against what the allies called partisans and what Mr. Putin, in a long standing tradition, will call bandits..This strong Germany, however, must be backed by more than sanctions. The full weight of NATO with TOTAL American backing must be committed to this effort if Mr. Putin and his army is to be stymied. As it seems he is ready to return to The Cold War then no sanctioning on earth is going to stop him. Since the West's intelligence seems clueless as to his intent, I recommend using the intelligence of history and just reason that his plan is similar to those in the past. When Bismarck said The secret to politics? Make a good treaty with Russia he was speaking from a position of strength..Time to heed good old Otto","If I were in charge of either Germany or France, I'd start looking to polish up my military forces as this Cease Fire is only in effect until someone at the scene fires the next shot and Mr. Putin's desire to incorporate Ukraine becomes active once more..We've seen, in the past, how negotiations work with dictators. It's not even the end of the beginning brewing here; it's just a pause until the weather becomes more spring like and the shooting, as well as invading, can continue..History repeats and nothing repeats like the history of Ukraine, Crimea and Poland when it comes to Eastern Europe..A strong Germany and France seem the only option as Mr. Putin's ultimate intentions still remain a mystery.","Dear Mr. Cohen, And everyone wonders why Iran wants nuclear devices! Mr. Putin realizes that while his country is being sanctioned, he has managed to walk away with Crimea and Ukraine, at least the eastern half, is well in Russia's sights. He has made deals with the rising East while American democracy looks like the shell it has always been full of discrimination, hatred, racism and just plain stupidity while a handful make gobs of money..Time to start thinking about a stronger Germany, perhaps? Poland is already starting to re-arm itself as they are the next domino in the sequence..The 21st Century, so far, seems not much different than the 20th with the Great War just continuing by other means.","Dear Mr. Friedman,.Still had to mention the interconnectivity  and interdependence  of the world, didn't you. Sometimes one should be careful what one wishes for. Mr. Putin and his oilgas dictatorship will, most likely, return as I do not think for one moment that the price per barrel of oil is not a manipulated cost rising and falling at the whims of the oil sellers (Odd that you seem to think that if America produces more oil, America also sells that oil; I believe corporations own the oil and sell it to whomever pays the most for it). How can it possibly be a fair market when there is NO competition among the oil sellers to try and corner this commodity? Why do gasoline prices at MobilExxon or Shell seem disturbingly identical? That's capitalism?.And using people who have appeared on Fox News (Folks like Ms. Palin or Mr. Rogers) as examples of just how dumb Fox News really is seems like  interviewing 'The Count from Sesame Street to try and understand the workings of the 'Large Hadron Collider; in both cases one is left with gibberish with The Count having a decided edge over anything the network of Scott Hannity might come up with..The fat lady hasn't finished singing. Mr. Putin may be a thug but he's a thug with some mighty powerful weapons and is not to be treated lightly..Prod a cornered bear long enough and that bear WILL strike back given no other options.","To the Editors, Why do I have an image of a giant Mr. Putin pulling strings like some kind of puppeteer; working backstage, denying involvement and, all the while, planning further encroachments?.Let's hustle to the bottom line; does anyone really wish to escalate to Defcon one over Ukraine? NATO seems not that interested and it seems the United States has it's hands full already..Perhaps it's Let's make a deal time: Mr. Putin, Ukraine is yours in return for your acquiescence to anything we, and our allies, do to combat ISIL..Fair enough?","To the Editors, I completely disagree with your first sentence; there are not innumerable questions concerning this crime. Mr. Putin and his government are completely responsible for this outrage. His proxy gunmenthugs shot the aircraft down because they were enabled by this nascent Czar to do just that..Perhaps Mr. Putin should spend less time blustering and lying and try to control the pseudo-army he has unleashed. If this is how he plans on impressing the rest of the world with his leadership he might just as well don a Cossack costume and lead a horde of mounted warriors across Europe. That, too, would be quite impressive but would also reduce the possibility of shooting down more unarmed civilians; tough to wield a sword at 33,000 feet..Mr. Putin, stop the lying and start the process of apology and make efforts to rein in your masked tribe of, apparently, uncivilized savages. Until then , the West's viewpoint of your culture is quite accurate; let us know when you plan on leaving the 19th Century and joining the rest of the more civilized world."

We will have to be very, very careful if we decide to work with either of them.  They have additional agendas, beyond defeating the opposition.","Yes, Mr. Cohen makes it sound as if Putin is dedicated to some philosophical and historical point of view.  He's only committed to activities that will make him the most money in the shortest time, before he gets found out by truth starved Russians.  If he bribesthreatens enough witnesses, the pubic will continue to hold him in apparent high regard.  At least, Russian polls say so.

Please explain.  When Putin withdraws all his fighters, influence, and armaments, Ukraine can be declared neutral, if that's what Ukraine wants.","There is no way any of us can know that Putin is overwhelmingly popular in Russia.  It's too dangerous to take a poll, and even more dangerous to answer the questions honestly.","I don't think Putin will stop with that concession, and neither do Ukraine's neighbors.","Well, it looks like they got nowhere with Putin.

Jon Harrison,,,,"The foreign policy experts who worry about Obama looking weak if he talks to Putin obviously don't care about the suffering Syrians. The wonks have no reasonable plan to defeat ISIS and end the suffering, and apparently they prefer more death to swallowing our pride a little. Russia is offering to carry the ball in Syria, and we refuse to talk to them? How should we characterize such a policy? As hypocrisy? As stupidity?..We don't have the gumption to go into Syria and clean up the mess ourselves (thank goodness). At the same time, we feel justified in sticking our nose into eastern Ukraine, a territory several thousand miles from our shores, but as close to Moscow as New York is to Washington, D.C. The whole question of weakness arises because the president chose to respond to Putin's actions in his own back yard...We need Russia in the fight against ISIS and Sunni jihadism generally. Assad is a terrible person, but we have no plausible alternative to him. We train a handful of supposedly pro-US rebels, and ISIS promptly annihilates them. There is no perfect solution to Syria, but the only way forward there is through cooperation with Russia.","@Andres: I agree that Putin is interested in propping up Assad and maintaining or expanding Russian influence in the Middle East. But he has to worry about a Syria ruled by ISIS. Such a state would reach out to Chechnya and attempt to foment anew the Islamic resistance movement there. And there are reportedly 2,500 Chechen fighters in Syria.","What will happen when the first Russian pilot is beheaded on YouTube? Will there be riots in the streets? I doubt it. Putin remains very popular, at least according the latest polls. The argument that there are 2,500 Chechen fighters in Syria probably resonates with your fellow Russians -- or am I wrong about that?","We are formally committed by treaty to come to the defense of the Baltic States and Poland, should they be attacked. What are the real chances that Russia will dare to invade a NATO country? The answer is that there is zero chance Putin would bring on a major European war against a Western alliance that is vastly more powerful than Russia. Eastern Ukraine is one thing; that's Russia's backyard. But Russia, a country facing massive economic and social problems, is not going to try to conquer Europe...The one caveat I would mention would be if Germany were to move away from the US and NATO and seek closer ties with Russia. However, this idea seems rather far-fetched, at least in the near term. If Germany ever did move away from NATO and ally with Russia, we would be unable to intervene in Eastern Europe, anyway -- the logistical problems alone would be insuperable, if Germany were closed to us as a staging area. ..I conclude therefore that stockpiling weapons and stationing a small body of troops in Eastern Europe is a needless provocation that can only exacerbate the already deteriorating relationship we have with Russia. And Russia remains a key partner on things like Iran, terrorism, and, long term, the need to contain China. Once again we are overestimating our own strength and seeking to appear as the world hegemon, a role we no longer have the power or the will to play.","Bill B makes an interesting point. But if the Europeans won't fight, we can't wage war in Eastern Europe. That would be the end of NATO in any case. ..If Putin were to grab a small piece of Estonia, should we send troops in? We're obligated to by treaty, but imagine the cost of fighting a war with supply lines stretching through the Baltic to the very doorstep of Russia. We would be staring defeat in the face..If Putin really wants a piece of Estonia, some pre-positioned  equipment and a handful of troops used as a tripwire won't stop him.","What will happen when the first Russian pilot is beheaded on YouTube?

I don't hold this against them; the Russian case is in fact stronger than most Americans will allow.

Jonnm,,,,The article accepts Putin at his word despite the fact he lied about the Crimea and has sent insurgents into the Ukraine. It is pretty obvious that there is no reason to trust him about anything he says. Nor is there any reason to help him with the mess he created. For the west to back off and accept a weak Ukraine that Russia can dominate and even help finance this new Russian colony is ridiculous. The majority of Ukrainians do not wish to be part of Putin's new little empire including many of the Russian speaking ones. The so called election was a farce just as the Crimean one was. Ultimately it is something the Ukrainians will have to decide and we in the west should support that decision. For Russia there has to be long term consequences. We can not patch up and pretend nothing has happened because it will mean Russia playing the same game again. Ukraine does not mean enough to the west to fight a war over but it must be a long term warning that Russia will never be a partner and for the most part is going an aggressive neighbor with delusions of empire with no regard for the sovereignty of its neighbors and a international spoiler who supports thuggish regimes like North Korea and Zimbabwe. We can deal with Russia but never trust it or give it any advantages including our technology. All commercial deals in the future must come under the scrutiny of the governments (primarily the EU and US) concerned with the possibility of rejection for strategic considerations.,Certainly they as bright as anyone else but if they truly were so concerned about being vandalized they would get rid of Putin and his buddies who are ripping off the country instead of supporting his attacks on foreign countries. Other countries have went through post imperial phases and are highly respected. Instead Putin and friends are trying to re establish the Russian empire and supporting some the most repressive and primitive governments in the world thinking it will re establish former Russian power.,As stated before you are assuming there was actually a divergence in opinion. It is well proven that Putin lied about Russian involvement in Crimea.,"It is true that the Ukraine does not hold much importance to the west and the west made no effect to subvert the Ukraine. What caused the fall of the Ukrainian government was its flaccid response to Putin's attempt to re assert the old Russian empire. It was simple over reach by Putin and no attempt at blaming the west will make it so. The Ukrainians saw themselves being sold off to a corrupt and decadent second rate empire, they compared this to joining one of the most advanced societies on the planet and overthrew the government. The west didn't cause this and in fact the EU might be criticized for not offering much of an incentive for the Ukraine to associate with it. The west did not send in subversives into Ukraine and continue directing them to destabilize the government, Russia did this.",Dreaming in Technicolor. Russia has alienated the majority of Ukrainians for a very long time. In addition he has taught the west a valuable lesson and that is not to trust Putin on anything he says. Russia is already a declining power whose only economy worth while is pumping oil and gas. Europe will no longer trust Russia as a supplier and will work to eliminate its vulnerability to Russian resources. Fortunately with the shale gas and other revolutions oil and gas are no longer of limited supply. The west will continue to work with Russia but not as a trusted partner but as a corrupt backward supplier of natural resources who wants to re establish its previously failed empire..,"Ukraine was destabilized when the democratically elected government knuckled under to heavy Russia pressure to become part of the new 3rd rate Russian empire. Putin grossly overplayed his hand and a large portion of the people rejected being re subjugated to Russia. Even if he does steal Eastern Ukraine he will have created in what remains of Ukraine right on his door step a new enemy. It is sheer arrogance and stupidity on his part. Russia did have real legitimate economic and ethnic interests in Eastern Ukraine But instead of standing up and negotiating these interests he decided to be the bully and try to restore his little empire. Instead of making Russia into the modern and accomplished state it could be, he wants it to be the corrupt and middling economic power at the center of a group of minor and backward countries. Now he has unnecessarily set the Ukrainian people and the two greatest powers in the world the US and the EU against Russia. REAL GENIUS.",,,,
John Ryan,,,,"Why negotiate with Putin? Give him a taste of the Russian (and recent US) adventure in Afghanistan.

As Russia's fortunes worsen, this may change, and Putin may share the fate of Khrushchev or Gorbachev, political anonymity.","Putin has to build the pipeline to a less reliable &amp; affluent customer and give Turkey free gas to boot.

Timeout,,,,"Herman, you seem incapable of understanding that Putin's attack on Ukraine means Russia is threatening European security - and consequently, American security, as well.","Judy, it was a kremlin Russian coup which occurred - in Crimea, when Putin attacked Ukraine..When you say we trained, did you mean to say that YOUR kremlin trained those murderous spetsnaz snipers on Kyiv's Maidan, and YOUR kremlin trained the green-men who invaded Crimea?",Putin's puppet Yanukovich ran away and defected to Putin's Mother Russia. Victor's own party disowned him. Victor can come back to Kyiv anytime and stand trial for the Maidan murders.,Yes Wendell - it IS true that Rob is just repeating absurd and ludicrous propaganda manufactured by Putin and promoted by RT!,"Hm - then it's equally possible that Putin did not invade Crimea... that there are no Kremlin-backed Russian fascists running around setting up republics within sovereign Ukraine... yes... I see... it all makes wacky, unstable sense... 300 civilians weren't killed; Putin is innocent...","MH17 happened because Putin's fascists attacked Ukraine, and most of Europe shrugged. Your euphemism of internal conflict is overwhelmingly devious, when this was a planned Kremlin military assault upon the sovereign territory of Ukraine. The conflict was imposed from an external source - from Moscow. What happened was a war crime: these Muscovite animals - who were happily ready to murder Ukrainians - ended up murdering 330 civilians. This was no mistake; this was deliberate Russian-sponsored terrorism.","The crash site can be managed by getting rid of Putin's Russian terrorists, the same fascist animals who shot down the plane, and who now control the crime scene. But you're not REALLY looking for a solution are you?","It is time to cut the Ukraine in half...??!.Nina, you are spreading despicable distortions - even after your 'heroic' Russian terrorist animals ended up killing 300 civilians, in their blood-lust to kill Ukrainians instead. Don't propagandize and pretend that isn't true. Putin's Kremlin-backed invaders were happily bragging that they killed more Ukrainians - until these rebel criminals got to the crash site, and discovered that they'd just murdered a plane full of civilians..Putin's Kremlin fascists have attacked Ukraine - get it, Nina??.The Kremlin's geo-political agenda has been to recreate, in effect, a successor USSR Eurasian union, called Novorossiya, a new Russian neo-fascist empire..These 300 civilian murder victims were just collateral damage caught in Putin's greater fascist ambitions..Neither your disinformation, Nina, nor Putin's proxy wars, will cut Ukraine in half: the world now clearly sees why Ukraine DID NOT WANT to be part of that psychotic criminal state known as Russia.","This editorial states ...Putin also sought to transfer blame to Ukraine, saying the tragedy would not have happened if Kiev had maintained a cease-fire. And he sanctimoniously declared no one has the right to use this tragedy to pursue their own political goals. That is not terribly convincing coming from Mr. Putin, who has cynically encouraged a dangerous secessionist conflict to grow until it became a threat to the world...I would also add that the ceasefire was ignored by the pro-Russian terrorists. Even during the ceasefire, they used shoulder-launch missiles, to shoot down a helicopter in Slavyansk, happily killing 9 Ukrainian servicemen, on Jun.24. ..Ukraine's President Poroshenko had offered these Kremlin invaders safe passage back to Mother Russia - but they refused, were mysteriously rearmed, and kept on murdering Ukrainians. ..Now - not even a month later - these same pro-Putin terrorists have killed 300 civilians on MH17 over Ukrainian soil...Everyone - Europe, USA, Asia, etc. - has had this time to take Putin's escalating invasion and destabilization of Ukraine seriously - now the world has experienced the brutality of Russian fascism.",

crane,,,,".This is not a nick on the chin. This is a flourish of intent by a world leader.who functions as a plutocrat and iss ourrounded by his 1. If we are fighting inequity in our own country, and if a country reaches out to us to intervene.in their effort to establish a legitimate democracy, then they are reaching out to us as Crimea is said to be reaching out to Mother Russia..They are reaching out to the European Union for support and inclusion.in a modern alliance and not a backward looking usurpation of countries into what has already been a failed concept:  the Soviet Union. There is nothing in Putin's past that assures anyone that he will be satisfied with a 'pittance' like Crimea, when he has conducted himself like an overlord and has his eyes fixed on wealth and dominance. i see this as just one move on a chess board. Even if it had been a fair electoral process, where Crimeans made a majority choice, his outrage is at Ukraine and his offering sanctuary to a.thief of the people's welath, just another oligarch, in the person of the coward, Yanukovych, says where his own priorities lie...I don't support the land grab of Palestine and i don't support his usurpation of Crimea and intent on Ukraine.   That does not excuse the US's long list.of grievous errors. God knows we have soiled our history and destroyed.vulnerable peoples. But we are now...not then. Let us be better.","I simply believe that if we want to find a long-term solution to the crisis in Ukraine, open, honest and equal dialogue is the only possible option, he said.....................'believe','honest', 'equal', 'open', 'dialogue' .. are not words that inhabit the actual and reptilian mind of V. Putin. He accomplished the death and chaos.he intended with his mercenaries in Halloween costumes. This latest move is nothing more than buying himself time which Putin believes he can buy.along with everything else in the world. His strategy is simply, shape shifting. ..Equality, is most certainly not Putin's objective. Unity is what he wants,.as in: the former Soviet Union. But that was not unity, it was domination..Lives have been spent on both sides of the furor. This is no concern to him...What concerns Vladimir Putin are two things: Money and Power..He will do everything now and in the future, no matter the human cost or offense to international cooperation to obtain both. Putin doesn't want dialogue.  He wants to be Ruler.","There is one person behind these seizures, it is Vladimir Putin. He pulls the strings on the puppets and coward that he is, and cowards that they are,.they pretend to anonymity or agents of the new republic. Putin is hungry for countries. His hubris is unbridled. A people who have been crushed, hated.and terrorized during the Soviet era, imagine that Putin is their Savior, and that he will restore their power and thriving. He will restore nothing more than further intimidation, dominance and isolation. It is a tragic betrayal, once again, of damaged people, people who survived decades of poverty and threat and now want fulfilling lives. He intends to work their wounds for.his ego's gratification and feeding of his insatiable greed. ..As to our role, the Ukrainian and Russians in Ukraine do not believe P.Obama's threats. They heard what he said re: Syria and what happened..They see Syria now. Unless he talks and walks, Putin's mercenary militias.will run rampant, seizing international observors, property and violating the rights of Ukrainians who only want their freedom...freedom from an Czarist president who stole their riches with impunity, and fed them to his oligarchic friends. Now he is Putin's best new friend. ..It's a travesty and if the international community does not act in concert on ethical principle, without parsing, halting, selfish agenda to help this nascent democracy, all will be lost. Except we will have made more enemies..That ...we can't afford.","Putin is trying to find his own variation of a twin-track decision, because he does not have a clear exit, said Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a political consultant who once worked for the Kremlin......................This is everything that's wrong about politics in general. Clearly, the way 'out' is to tell the truth. However, with the constant leveraging and distortion of 'truth' in favor of political consequence, truth is rarely considered a viable option, therefore, there is too seldom, 'justice' and rarely, mercy...which is what the victims, the families of victims and the entire global community needs more than anything a return to the 'humane' as of superior value to.'gain'. ..This is a terrible situation and Putin can hardly expect the world community to trust his words when he has consistently lied and exploited turbulence globally for his own enrichment and that of his oligarchic friends, as well as.his amassing of power.  Here is a man also supplying Azerbaijan with arms.and pretending he is not intending to use this against Armenia who he is playing with, like a cat and a mouse, dangling the Customs Union above their head, with the claw of Azerbaijian arms overhead. ..Putin must learn that the world,not on his dole or under his fist,.does not believe his lies, nor do we consider his 'sleight of hand' back room bribes and threats as political 'norm'. We see it as the corruption of a dictatorial mind attempting to bring the Soviet Union back together under himself.","He singled out... Putin of Russia,.. He has the most control over that situation, Mr. Obama said, and so far, at least, he has not exercised it...................I disagree. Mr. Putin has exercised total control over the situation from the inception of the rebel plan to seize Crimea. it is simply that his control is self serving and demonstrates a total disregard for human life. We're talking about a power hungry KGB man, trained as a ruthless operative, who jails his political challengers and 'eliminates' journalists who bear witness against him. His goal is to imperialize and reassemble Eastern Europe under his total control, as a 'new' Soviet Union. He armed the rebels and they answer to him. There is no way they would behave in such an emboldened way without Putin's dominating assurance and supply.....................................................Putin's denial and pretended tragic sadness, is sham and insult to the dead..The risk of Inciting and arming rogue rebels didn't occur to him as he suppled missiles?  Of course it did.  He simply does not care.","The gall of Putin to deflect blame to Ukraine is only in keeping of his culture of.utterly universal denial, deception and impunity.  There is nothing that Putin does for which he is willing to accept consequence. Always the first to claim.dominance, the last to admit the foul nexus of his goals, method and certainly, not counting the corpses in his wake.","Russia has denied any such role, and its military officials have pushed a competing scenario, inculpating Ukraine..............................................................The problem with Putin is that whenever you expect a liar to be truthful, you're in for disappointment. He has a very long record of total disregard for truth, ruthlessness, opacity, and has no qualms about throwing others under the bus he's driven...The very fact of the rebel's 'confiscation' of evidence and contempt for the.fact that they are allowing 'human remains' to be desecrated and hauled around like trash, shows the extent to which they are willing to go to escape scrutiny for what is sure to be their doing and Russia's complicity. I believe they were under orders from the Kremlin to conceal it all...This is war and they should be prosecuted for war crimes and so should Putin for providing such weapons to those unstable rebels. ..Putin false posing as participant in UN Security Council demand for access and condemnation, is the worst sort of hypocrisy, and despite Putin living in delusional sociopathy and magic tricks, no one outside of Russia believes him. He's just another Baghdad Bob  Putin should be prosecuted.  ..As to his ludicrous statement:   no one has the right to use this tragedy to pursue their own political goals...That's funny stuff.   If it weren't so unthinkably tragic.","Putin behaves true to form. As former KGB he intends to crush opposition by means above or below the law. His fury is that he.cannot demand the respect he sought with his Olympic extravaganza, while  ordinary Russians today, go hungry. Putin's consolation prize is to flex his bully strength while a cowering deposed Yanukovych cringes under his wing. Of course, the Russian people crow his name in the streets.They are more than familiar with his wrath, the disappearances of critical journalists and dissidents in service of his oligarchic interests. A fearful public is not a loyal public, but a hostage to propganda. Putin's lifestyle, shamefully opulent, should be enough evidence against him. Those Crimeans who claim to be pro-Russian? Most are poor. I ask one thing: Why did they (and those few rich among them) move to Ukraine? If I am a Canadian citizen, should I expect: a US passport, should the US cough up a land mass, or should Canada annex North Dakota so I can go fishing and they can drill?.Putin is driving the whole scenario to re-instate his partner in crime(a) Yanukovych, and tp ensure the flow to his coffers.  He cares little for people..Like 'his' Olympians,they are chess pieces to be utilized for his own ends...The world community really must step up to prevent such predation against.the nascent Ukrainian hope. Our alliance: not mere words, political postures or empty threats. We must thwart economic flow to Russia and enrich Ukraine. A friend in need  deed.","Their response to the sting of sanctions is to send in the clowns..However, Putin claims his troops roiling at Ukrainian borders are just exercising...Yes, that's entirely feasible. I'm confident that they're just practicing the 'Semaphore version of Wuthering Heights' at the order of the Kremlin's MInistry of Silly Walks.","Mike....I don't know if you intended your spelling of: 'Un tied' States..But if so, it's an interesting concept. By contrast, Putin intends to 're-tie' the.Dis-united former Soviet Union back unto himself, with chains...You must include all those countries who are and will stand in solidarity with America to isolate Russia. Will the majority of world countries become the Russian people's enemy? So far, no other country has taken Putin's side...Are we all the enemy of those surrounding countries that wish to be free democracies? Russia stands to lose a great deal. Putin's bare chested posturing is not convincing. He is becoming an isolated outlaw."

Jerry Fincher Hough,,,,Excellent.  Then Ukraine will have to give the federalism we had in 1787 with a divided country.  Putin doesn't want the east.   We wants a Ukraine that is basically accommodating and that requires the Russians voters stay in.,"Do remember who Matlock is.   Ronald Reagan's chief adviser on Russia Matlock thinks (and (rightly, I think) that Reagan was committed to peace with Russia from the first and had the military buildup not to frighten the Soviet Union (who scarcely cared about the naval buildup) but to given Americans the self-confidence that peace was possible.  ..Douhat's article strengthens all the bad American stereotypes as a way to advance a moderate, intelligent policy.   But some time someone has to say that Americans need to learn to think realistically about foreign policy.  Putin has been very cautious in foreign policy, but like every ruler he thinks that the reasonable national interests should be defended (not just Applegate's Polish paranoia.   This is not malign at all, but the nature of the world...Matlock's point is that the US thinks that any country that has interests that do not correspond to American is illegitimate.  That is the path to disaster, a and we are well along the path.    ..The place where we really need to think seriously is Iran.  It has no interest in bombing Israel, only in balancing the nuclear capability of Sunni, unstable Pakistan on its border as the two move to conflict in Afghanistan.  That may well be our and Russian interest, but it is impossible to even discuss such matters or suggest that we and Russia have common interests in the Middle East and South Asia.   The discussion will, no doubt, only begin after the bombing of Iran.","Ian could go much further, but hints at some of the paradoxes.  First, we are providing huge aid to Ukraine (a government that overthrew a government that had agreed to EU early elections)  so it can pay off Russian debt and higher oil and gas prices. Putin can live with that kind of sanction...Second, Russia and India are allies. This means against nuclear, Sunni unstable Pakistan that is highly likely to come into dangerous conflict with Farshi Iran in the Sunni-Farshi conflict in Afghanistan. Russian and Iranian interests are much the same in Afghanistan, and Russia (maybe even the US) has an interest in Iran being a nuclear counterbalance to Pakistan.  ..Iran couldn't care less about Israel except rhetorically.  It is looking to nuclear Pakistan on its border. If Russian planes fly into Iran (and they would into Syria if the US thought of a Libya-type flyover policy), the US policy really goes down in flames...Third, all the talk about EU economic reform must recognize the east and south are the least efficient.  A Greece or even semi-Greece policy will produce riots worse in the east and south  than in Athens because they will have a nationalist base and a credible policy of political withdrawal.  Any Russian leader would have to respond...Fourth, the Western Ukrainian radicals like Tymoshenko want to drive the Russians out of the electorate so they can win an election.  Why did they overthrow a regime that was promising an election?..We are way over our heads in this.","The problem is more fundamental.  Jack Matlock, Reonald Reagan's cjoef adviser has it right.   The US fell into the assumption that the only legitimate Russian foreign policy was one that followe US (and that meant Israeli) foreign policy 100.   Yeltsin essentially did that in exchange for Western bribers...Putin has had a very cautious foreign policy, but Russia has interests.   What would the US say if Baja California vpted fpr annexaion with the US and we accepted as we did Texas and if Russia then imposed sanctions for that?..Putin was right in agreeing with Robert Gates that Libya was crazy. but he did nothing.  He was right that the fundamentalist Saudi Arabia had no business destabilizing Syria.  There he did signal that Rissoia would intervene with its planes if the US tried to overthrow Assad with its air force.  But he was on the side of international law on that question...The interesting question is Iran.  Iran has no interest in bombing Israel, but is concerned with nuclear, unstable, nuclear Pakistan on its border, especially since it may have a major conflict with it in Afghanistan.  Depending on what happens with Modi and Pakistan, it may be in U.S interest for Iran to have nuclear capability.   Russia on the border of that area understands it a lot better than the US...And what has been Obama's policy towards Russia besides insisting it follows US-Israel policy?   Offend Putin by playing domestic gay politics at the Olympics!!",Why should Putin take seriously President who thinks the essence of international relations is to insult the leader of another great power with a cheap and stupid gesture on gay politics at the Olympics.,"This makes no sense...Yanukovych agreed to the EU compromise.   It was overthrown by extremists with no desire to reassure the south and the east and who have, as the editorial says, shown no ability to rule.  This is Putin's fault?  ..Ukraine is an unnatural country.  If the West Ukrainians feel they need to force out the Russian voters to create an electorate in which they have a majority, that is a reasonable strategy--like Jordan getting rid of the Palestinians on the West Bank in 1967.   But the West should accept it as calmly as they did the breakup of Yugoslavia...The only ones who want a Cold War with Putin are those who want the clear definition of the Cold War in the Middle East--and the rejection of Friedman's policy of peace on the West Bank.","Do the editors have any idea of the possible scenarios?..When the US thought of Libya-like flyovers in Syria, Putin signaled decisively he would defend Syria, no doubt by flying in planes to protect Syrian air space. I assume they were clearer in private. Obama wisely backed off...Now in the looming an Iranian-Pakistan conflict over the Pashtuns and Farshi in Afghanistan,, the Russians have a common interests with Iran.  Iran wants nuclear bombs not to kill Muslims in Israel, but to balance Sunni, unstable nuclear Pakistan.   Russia shares that interest...What happens if it flies its planes into Iran to defend against Israeli planes?   I don't know the odds, surely not 100, but surely nowhere near zero...For 40 years I was a prominent specialist on the Soviet Union, 20 of them at Brookings.  I have nearly finished an archive book on the domestic politics  of the origins of the Cold War...It is absolutely wrong to say there might be a new Cold War.   The Cold War was the use of confrontation to cooperate in ending the civil war in Europe.  We approved Warsaw Pact, as the Kissinger team said publicly, and they approved NATO publicly with Gromyko's code words German revanchism. Together we brought peace in Europe until now...This is far worse and more dangerous.  And it comes when 200 oil will hurt countries like India and induce Modi to be  an anti-Pakistan nationalist.      The Obama Administration only plays domestic politics with no geopolitical sense.This must end.",,,

Richard Cusick,,,,The article stated Russia must admit it is a party to the conflict. This is the central point; one those sympathetic to the Russian point of view seem to miss. Putin wants his way and as he bragged he has the military might to back it up yet he does not want to directly negotiate. If he did those negotiations would be difficult but possible. The US  and the EU could reasonably ask the Ukraine to be flexible. But Putin in repeatedly saying he wants negotiations and a cease fire also wants the separatists and the Russian supporters in Ukraine to be legitimized as a negotiating partner. Ukraine correctly can't do that. They can negotiate with Russia but not with Russians posing as Ukrainians.  Putin's manipulations are the key barriers to peace. It seems he still doesn't know how much he can get away with and will not be reasonable until he feels the firm affects of that's far enough..The only way out then is not to give way to manipulation but to get Putin to responsibly negotiate.,The real question is how far Putin wants to go. Will he be satisfied now or is this another manipulation? Promising peace but really wanting a land route to Crimea. We can only hope he is willing to stop here. The whole world can only hope because it really is in the hands of one man. To say he will leave the situation as it is now is just wishful thinking. Crimea would be so much easier to administer with a land route to Russia.,I am glad the article brings forward an important point; destroying the Russian economy may bring dangerous results. Privately communicating our willingness and desire to meet Russia half way is surely underway. The ball is clearly in Putin's court. He knows this Europe and America knows this. When Putin gets serious and follows through with actions to deescalate he will find ready partners..But until he actually changes direction we need to patiently stay the course.,While I find Mr. Wergin's piece to be informative and refreshing in dismissing Putin's apologists I miss a piece that respects Russian interests and charts a middle course..How can Putin or pro Russian Ukrainians  manage to have a referendum?.How do you peacefully part ways?,Rabin used to say he would negotiate with the Palestinians as if there were no terror and fight the terror as if there were no negotiations. That level headed firmness is what is needed. Negotiations need to take place as if Putin and Eastern Ukrainians really wants peace and Europe needs to impose sanctions as if he doesn't..This position may appear weak or too strong to one side or the other but it includes a duality of thought too lacking in most comments.,Putin's popularity for being strong and decisive in Russia and Obama's low poll numbers point to the fickleness of popular perceptions. How shallow we all are..In my eyes Obama's hesitation to bomb Syria took real courage. He was willing to look weak in order to do what felt right in the moment. We all benefited but his general popularity declined.,,,,

And then the parent wonders why the child is a brat and doesnt respect them.","After watching Obama's bold, decisive response following Syria's use of chemical weapons and his masterful handling of Iran, Putin will walk very gingerly through the Ukraine crisis.

In the meantime, Russia served as the wall that kept Muslim armies out of Europe for over 300 years, at considerable coast in Russian blood and treasure.  Get a perspective.","If it comes to a war with Russia, we can kiss every first-world capital goodbye, and NYC and Houston as well.  This must be done carefully, and the intelligent people in every government must work to get Putin removed peacefully.

However, the majority of Russians are good, civilized people and don't deserve to be dragged into a world war by Putin and our own reactionaries.","Putin's kleptocratic allies should have advised him to maintain an honest government in the Ukraine, and this war never would have happened.",Putin's training in the secret police has blinded him to the simple truth that you can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar.,The west has managed to get itself into a widespread war in the first two decades of every century since 1100.

While most of them support a Russian Crimea, I doubt that they support Putin's goose-stepping slouch toward totalitarianism.

The Buk M2 (NATO reporting name, SA-11) mobile SAM (surface to air missile) system is a highly sophisticated mobile radar, computer and missile launching system that's dangerous enough in the hands of highly trained professionals who are computer and IFF (identification friend or foe) savvy. Normally, such personnel are working for the military of a sovereign government obeying Geneva Convention compliant ROE (rules of engagement). In the hands of incompetent, blundering, disorganized paramilitary separatists, the powerful mobile radar, computer center, missile launcher was a disaster waiting to happen...Those separatist idiots of course, just shot down more than a civilian airliner. They shot down any last shred of political credibility they ever had with any sympathizers in the West, and more importantly, with the East. It's unimaginable and untenable from a game theory standpoint, that Mr. Putin would have anything to gain by such a tragic atrocity. Russia is not the only power in the world to hand weapons technology to the wrong people, incidentally...The West now has an opportunity to negotiate settlements with both Russia and Ukraine that can put the conflict on political, rather than military footings. This is the only way to avoid the further tragic loss of life, and this is a good moment to do it.","I thought I knew what the word cynical meant until I saw this article!

YouNo,,,,"Living in Texas, you don't have to fully understand, and that's a really good thing. ..Ukraine was literally gutted of its culture and its intelligentsia under Soviet Russian leadership. It became accustomed to street disappearings of Ukrainian cultural idealists and a government that lies through its teeth about everything, while enriching the pockets of The Party with no expense spared...That mindset did not disappear just because the Kremlin lost direct control. Yanukovych, by Ukrainian accounts, was a thief, a Russian puppet, and probably a murderer (it is widely assumed that he had his primary opponent during a presidential campaign poisoned, though that may have been Putin as well). Waiting for him to become honest probably would have been a fool's game. I'd imagine it looked like a sure invitation to have the boot strike down on the protesters necks once the Majdan had cleared. Besides, the EU requires leaders to open their books to scrutiny, and the thefts by Yanukovych and his type, was a large reason the Majdan wanted the EU in the first place...Ukraine left the Kremlin peacefully, but it seems the Kremlin will not return such niceties.","To be honest, I thought the Kremlin had the upper hand until I saw Ukraine seriously fighting back. I don't think the Kremlin or the world, knows what Putin is up against in Ukraine. ..Ukraine, in my opinion, is holding back. They may not have the numbers of aircraft, but they have the missiles to destroy the Kremlin's air-force and I think Putin knows it. Ukraine may not have a numeric armor column, but they have the willing ground troops and equipment to fight Russian armor to a standstill. ..Make no mistake, Ukraine is serious about its own defense, and Putin doesn't have nearly a 4 to 1 ratio on tech, or manpower, to successfully invade Ukraine. I'd not give the Kremlin greater than 3 to 1, and then only if they broke out the old forward or we shoot.","despite contrary evidence in the body of the story) .And Despite evidence in the bodies returning with dog-tags in tow.....The west is capable, at this moment, of drawing a line with troops. Putin isn't mad? ..Then he won't bomb US troops because nobody wants nuclear winter...If Putin is crazy enough to attack the US for assisting a sovereign nation on land that isn't his, then hadn't we better get after him before he gets stronger?","This makes no sense at all..The conflict, according to Putin himself, doesn't involve Russia...Why would criticizing Putin prolong the conflict?..Thank you for admitting that Russia is the aggressor in Ukraine.","Considering the squalor most Russians live in, bombing them back to the stone-age wouldn't be much of a change. But who in the Kremlin can worry for such things when there's a profit to be made?..Besides, Putin can pay to have more gymnast prostitutes line his bunkers in the Urals and spend his last days playing hunter with his paid prey. Considering the life outside of that bunker, before and after the bombings, he'll have a long list of gymnasts to pick from...We're all waiting.","If Putin hasn't sent troops into Ukraine, as he constantly says, then the US backing the Ukrainian government in its fight against, what are clearly terrorists to Ukraine (corporal punishment of civilians is a war crime), shouldn't be a concern...Send US fighter planes, supplies and ground forces immediately. ..If Russia wishes to attack US troops, so be it.","The West is totally complicit in this because we continue to allow Putin to have it both ways. He blatantly lies in public about the level of Russian involvement and no one calls him on it..Agree on this. ..the Ukraine military and local militias are no match for Russian regular troops.I think this is wrong, and Russia could only take Mariupol with high causalities.

Mike Murray MD,,,,Ukraine had been a part of Russia for hundreds of years prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's. If they had a Lincoln for president rather than a Putin they would already have it back.,Ukraine is not a territory seized by the Soviet Union after the Second World War.  Ukraine has been a part of Russia for several hundred years. Millions of Russian soldiers died defending it from the Germans and then retaking it. If there is a valid historical comparison it is with the secession of the southern states of the United States in 1860. If Russia had a Lincoln instead of a Putin they would probably have it back by now.

I believe Coca Cola, MacDonald's and Pepsico do business there. It could be a sanction imposed by commerce, that we as concerned citizens can participate directly.","As long as US policies maintain a cheap dollar and expensive oil (Keystone Pipeline stonewall), Putin rakes in.

Leon,,,,"Truth is that without Russia's participation there cannot be peace in Syria. They will simply provide the weapons to prop up the regime for it  to survive for ever..Also, Russia is an interested party in the fight against ISIL.

The children of the American retirees are then kidnapped by the hundreds and their remains are later found with signs of having been executed in several abandoned mines...As all of this unfolds what would have been the reaction of President Obama and the US Congress? I would dare to say that it would not have been as restrained as that of President Putin.","It amazes me that the hatred for Putin leads to superficial commentaries such as this by Mr. Friedman..Obviously Mr. Putin plays by his own rules and will go as far as he can, but to imply that he is not a thinker, that he is a hockey player and not a chess player is an absurdity in view of the almost perfect, from a military point of view , capture of Crimea..Mr. Friedman affirms that we are smart and Mr. Putin is dumb.

But the USSR placed more than a million in the eastern Ukraine after they 'absorbed' the Ukraine.  They planted Russians to assure that the only area of the Ukraine would be populated by Russians so they could claim it as Russia.  This was no accident, although Putin did wait until the corrupt leader that stole the Ukrainian's money and property was ousted.  It gave him a diplomatic reason to do so, even though anyone in the Ukraine will tell you the election was not legal as most were not allowed to vote.","Too many commenters do not understand history.  The Urkraine must be able to keep Crimea.  It is a part of their country.  Yes, Russians took it and held it for a long time.  And they exported hundreds of thousands of Russians to Crimea when they were the Soviet Union.  For one purpose, to make Crimea their own...I understand the military base in Crimea, although I'm not too sure who is being protected from whom.  However, Crimea is essential to the survival of the Ukranian people.  ..Anyone that thinks this action is like the Arab Spring or Kosovo and Serbia is misinformed at best.  Russia has proven itself to be a government that cannot be trusted.  Putin is a lier that spreads propaganda throughout Moscow.  ..We need European and US leaders to stand up to Russia, or the world will continue to live on the edge of war as Russia and China extend their ownership.  Diplomacy and sanctions will not work.  And as Iran is watching, they too are smiling at the incompetence of the world in reining in the illegal occupation of Crimea.

Just like one would not expect an unbiased opinion from a Russian career diplomat about US foreign policy...Despite his biases Mr. McFaul has always been very engaged with Russian audience, so I was curious to read his analysis. The article has a lot of ideological rhetoric that paints a bleak picture of Russia and points at Putin as the evil force behind it all.  Unfortunately it falls short of trying to find historic and economic reasons for the situation in Russia. In my opinion the main reason why it failed to do so is that Mr. McFaul indiscriminately projects American textbook expectations of what a democracy should look like in every country around the world. ..Its even more amazing that this dogmatic approach has been the US policy towards Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union without any significant adjustments to reality. And the reality was that Yeltsins years of liberalization that US might consider an ideal path toward democracy ended up in Russian financial default of 1998 and subsequent collapse with heavy economic and social consequences. And the fact that US continued pushing the same approach makes me wonder about sincerity of US proclamations that these changes are in the best interest of Russian society...Russia today is not the evil empire and not even an adversary to the US.",How is it possible that on one hand we say Putin has only himself to blame for the economic troubles and then turn around and cheer Yay!

Eddie,,,,What Putin is getting (in his mind) from all his shenanigans is an inflated boost to his machismo.,"I'm not sure the if Russia put troops on the Mexican or the Canadian border argument holds here. NATO is made up of international troops founded to protect Europe from Soviet expansion. Putin seems to think he can regain the former Soviet colonial tribute countries. Some will capitulate, but others, like the Baltic States, need help in protecting themselves from Russia's need to regain its self esteem at their expense. NATO is their only defense. Canada and Mexico were never former Soviet colonies and chances are very slim that Russian troops will end up on Western Hemisphere soil - hopefully.","We fought a bloody war with Germany and Japan and devastated them. But somehow, we helped them get back on their feet and helped make them  rich, and economically successful. The result is that we are good friends and allies. What happened with Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union?..While it wasn't hot,we did fight a something of a war. We came out winners only because of the fundamental rot that collapsed the Soviet Union and now we are confronting a dangerous situation: we gloated and did not allow Russia save face. Now a creep took hold of it and is trying to revive the former glory - whatever that was - of a corrupt despotism. ..Could we have done something different when we had the opportunity? We have some of the burden to bear. Before Putin, we should have done something creative with NATO because technically it was not needed anymore and we should have gradually phased it out. Instead, we shoved it in the face of the Russians, which made them feel vulnerable. When people feel vulnerable, all sorts of ugly creature crawl out from under rocks and Russia, always susceptible to despots, rallied behind Putin for defense. ..We were brilliant after WWII, what happened? Reagen and Bush - and the the cowboys they spawned also have something to do with the Russian problem. Their mission was accomplished - to make someone, in this case, Russia, our enemy. It's good for business...We live in interesting times.","Terror is still Putin's way, the ultimate Russian Mafia (KGB) don. He's protecting cosa nostra (our thing), a warped sense of injustice inflated to use in his favor to hold on to power, with a perfect ally, the opportunistic Orthodox Church...Now, we, are partially to blame because a Cold War is good for business, whose business? Sclerotic old Protestant white men who still manipulate so much of our country's policy. ..Money, power hungry men, religion. Some things never change...Putinism and American Exceptionalism, a match made in Kleptomania-Megalomania heaven.","Russia's whole history is one of despotic rulers. The Russian people are comfortable with strong rulers, and for a few years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, they toyed with democracy; it didn't take. Putin is now their czar and Russians seem to be okay with it...If Russia becomes a democracy, it will be very far into the future, after institutions are set in place. The irony is that the world's foremost democracy, the US, is showing signs of crumbling and reverting to serfdom...Does democracy have a shelf life? Tune in and see if we, the first modern democracy, lasts.","Regarding Khodorkovsky, everyone above is calling him a crook in the various responses to the above article. Here is part of his profile on Wikipedia:..Khodorkovsky also became a philanthropist, whose efforts include the provision of internet-training centres for teachers, a forum for the discussion by journalists of reform and democracy, and the establishment of foundations which finance archaeological digs, cultural exchanges, summer camps for children and a boarding school for orphans.....He is openly critical of what he refers to as 'managed democracy' within Russia. Careful normally not to criticise the elected leadership, he says the military and security services exercise too much authority. .....Khordorkovsky promoted social programs through Yukos in regions where the company operated. One such program that was popular in Angarsk, New Civilization, promoted student government for young adults. The scout program incorporated aspects of student government. Participants from throughout the country spent their holidays organizing student governed bodies at summer camps...I can see why Putin wanted him out of the picture. The above makes him sound like a nicer crook than Putin.",I don't think Putin cares about climate change nor about his people.

They are using the nationalism card to manipulate and convince a people with a still deeply ingrained instinct for tribalism - it's a human trait, not only Russian...His aim is to be the tribal chief and control power, along with his oligarchic priest allies...The US has tried an experiment in a truly democratic government, and after 217 years, it's citizens are defaulting into serfdom, allowing the chiefs, who happen to be oligarchs, to control them too...The democratic bug still has great hold on the imagination and has spread throughout the world, with the US being the spearhead - although an increasingly dull one...The Ukraine conflict is an age old ritual in human primitivism that will continue to punctuate human history. Power grabs by a few in order to exercise their primitive greed with impunity...It's the human condition and will continue to rule us until we conquer our id by the superego. It sounds like a case of the individual, but a country is a collection of individuals with common traits...Civilization is a razor thin skin we cover ourselves with in order to look acceptable. But as long as the Putins of the world -  the US has it's inner-Putins too - know how to manipulate the tribe, these conflicts will never end.","Poor Putin. He takes the loss of the old Soviet empire so personally. Is it machismo? I'm sure the Russian people couldn't care less about the Ukraine. They just want to go about their life shedding the old Soviet mistake and make some money - and become like the decadent west. Once, their leaders were the decadent ones, now they want to get in on it too...Does Putin not see how transparent he is? And the Church, abetting the louts, giving license to bad behavior. It's a comedy; too bad it a not very funny one though, with its xenophobia and hatred for so many of its fellow human beings...I though the world was getting more civilized? There is nothing like power and money to corrupt; IMO, this is what the whole mess is about, caused by a sad man's inferiority complex, who just happens to have a huge arsenal of weapons at his fingertips."

This is quite obvious now to the G7 leaders, as well as to most other countries.  ..These latest Putin demands (ordering Ukrainian forces out of Eastern Ukraine) make me seriously question his rationality. ..If this were 1914 or 1939 this type of aggression would probably already have resulted in European war...But Putin uses the fear of WW3 to blackmail the West into accepting his annexation of neighbouring territories...Consequently, Putins Russia has lost every shred of credibility that it had  built up in recent years and is now to become a leper on the international stage for as long as Putin and Medvedev occupy the revolving leadership.  ..Putin has proven to be a serial liar who lies with shameless aplomb whenever asked about the nationality of the troops occupying Ukraine.  His online choir has, on cue,  rushed, pack-like,  to every major western media site, howling the PutinLavrov line with Pavlovian fervour...As for Putin wishing only for peace and stability in Uktraine .....<a hrefhttp:1.bp.blogspot.com-FzNkEwyUSyAUxYQTJ6kERIAAAAAAAAONo4W8o0z3tyjAs1600Russianbear.gif titlehttp:1.bp.blogspot.com-FzNkEwyUSyAUxYQTJ6kERIAAAAAAAAONo4W8o0z3tyjAs1600Russianbear.gif targetblank>http:1.bp.blogspot.com-FzNkEwyUSyAUxYQTJ6kERIAAAAAAAAONo4W8o0z3tyj...<a>","I sense a theme among many commenters here.  Ukraine is right next-door to Russia, America is far away from the region, wars result in terrible tragedy for all sides, wars are too costly and require much sacrifice (if done properly), Ukraine was once part of Russia, Putin will stop at nothing to reclaim Russia status and honor, the WestNATO was threatening to Russia, etc.  All those reasons may be true.  They were also true about Germany in WWII, and of course, most Americans didn't want the US to get involved in that war either, for many similar reasons (until the Japanese showed up in Pearl Harbor and added some clarity to the situation).  Just knowing history won't prevent it from repeating itself.  As in 1914 and 1941, we are sleepwalking our way into war.  We should wake up and open our eyes.",Putin has no intention of allowing international teams into the crash site until all the pieces of wreckage that show missile damage have been removed...It is Putin's creatures who have committed this atrocity...Putin is therefore focused on cleaning up a murder scene before investigators arrive...Those deceased that have suffered missile damage will also be mysteriously disappeared.,"Really!! It must be a slow news day at the NYT. This article is so far from being an intellectual analysis that Alpha Centauri is closer. It seems that after each 'thoroughly considered' analysis of Putin, every political journalist in the West wants to come up with another even more ridiculous analysis of his actionscharacter. Blind Harry can see that US and European make-it-up-as-we-go-strategy in Iraq, Libya and Syria has been disastrous for the people, the region and Europe, where all these 'refugees' wish to seek refuge...So why is so hard to see that Putin's move into Syria is as simple as helping a friend in need, wipe out all those crazies who wish to overthrow an ally, and stabilize the region that the West is doing all it can to destabilize!!",Putin thinks we are still in the Cold War.  So last century.  How did Ronald Reagan deal with the Soviet Union without a massive war?  Maybe President Obama has something to learn from Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush.  But I guess President Obama is too smart to learn anything from anybody else.  That is what happens when President Obama is the smartest person in the room.,"NATO meets in Wales and . surprise . surprise .. Putin starts talking Peace. ..Whenever international outrage spikes over Putins invasion of Ukraine, he simply sprinkles A pinch of Elfen peace dust into the worlds media...This Elfen peace dust is designed to put the West back to sleep...In this specific case it is designed to prevent NATO from announcing strong countermeasures to Russian aggression in Ukraine...If NATO drinks a lot of coffee and manages to stay awake, be prepared for The Deceitful Duo (Putin and Lavrov)  to say that they truly, truly want peace and that its the mean NATO that is the aggressor...Everyone note that Putin is still saying that Russia isnt involved, despite everyone outside of Russia knowing that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is underway...In other words the Putin strategy is unchanged and everything he says is simply an attempt to deceive...I hope the West is now awake to Putin .. and stays awake.","Thank you President Obama.  Thank you Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.  Maybe we should be drawing more red lines.  Obama and Putin agree on one thing.  America looks so weak, just the way Obama and Putin want it.","Respecting the vote is a term that means nothing when it comes from Mr Putin...Earlier this month Mr. Putin urged the East Ukrainian separatists to postpone a referendum on independence. After it was conducted anyway, the Kremlin said it respected the vote, but stopped short of recognizing the results...Apparently Respecting the vote does not mean the same as endorsing or recognising the vote...Mr. Putin stopped short of saying he would recognize the vote as legitimate, and reiterated his assertion that the government in the capital, Kiev, which is organizing the vote, had usurped the power of President Victor F. Yanukovych in a coup. The election will not represent a general national mandate, he said...I think this makes it crystal clear that Putin has not changed his position one iota and therefore will not recognise the legitimacy of the elections.","The gas fields have always been the main game...Putin has known all along that the West would never dare to grab Sebastopol . any such move would have immediately resulted in WW3. ..Neither did Putin care for the Russian-speakers in the Crimea...The whole securing Sebastopol meme was a cover for the aggressive theft of the Ukrainian gas fields.  This required the annexation of the Crimea and it's maritime territories. ..This seizure of the gas fields advantages Putin in several ways...It will further enrich the Russian gas oligarchs (including Putin)..It will ensure the continued impoverishment of the Ukrainian treasury..It removes competition and safeguards the Putin gas monopoly in    Europe. ..Putin has destabilised the Eastern provinces of Ukraine:..To derail the 25th May elections  a leaderless Ukraine is easier to plunder...To prevent Ukraine from exercising its democratic wish to join the West via EU membership.  ..Putin cares nothing for the people of Ukraine...He has invaded and seized their territory, breaking several international agreements, and is doing his best to instigate a bloody civil war in order to consolidate his position and eliminate any organised Ukrainian opposition.  ..He ignores the majority Ukrainian desire for closer ties with the West...Putin is more oligarch than President...To really understand Putin you must follow the gas pipelines.","I hope Mr Putin is proud of this latest atrocity in Ukraine...He owns it. ..During the last few months, despite mounting what must be the greatest online propaganda offensive in history, Putin has completely failed to convince the international community that his actions are anything other than illegal...This is unsurprising...It is impossible to defend the indefensible...The international community has condemned Russia for breaking international law and sanctions have been applied against Russia.  ..It has been clear for some time that Putins incursion into East Ukraine was simply to bully Ukraine into accepting the loss of The Crimea and to take the minds of the international community off that illegal annexation...The collateral damage has been:..The hundreds of dead Ukrainian soldiers (defending their country) ..The hundreds of dead pro-Russian separatists in the East who believed.Putin was coming.  ..Nearly 300 innocent passengers and crew on a commercial airliner...All have died providing Putin with his sideshow of distraction...Putin no doubt knew that there was a potential for this sideshow to become very bloody and take the lives of thousands of people. ..For months he has lied and has been caught out lying. ..Putin is a serial liar who blames everyone else for his atrocities in a very transparent attempt to avoid international sanctions...He will no doubt try to wash his hands of this latest atrocity as well...Mr Putin . Who do you think you are fooling?"

As usual, McCain ignores history in his desire to vent his spleen.  And we've heard all this before from him--and rejected this combination of provocative saber-rattling and belligerence in 2008!..Also, I find his comments about ill-gotten proceeds and kleptocracy to seriously ironical--apparently unintentionally.

And the West, protecting the people of Ukraine from long-standing brutality at the hands of first tsarist and then Soviet Russia must be ever watchful...The territorial integrity of Ukraine (including Crimea) was guaranteed by international treaty to which the US and Russia were both signatories. The Soviet Union ceded Crimea to Ukraine in a legal action. I am astonished that anybody should condone the breaking of international law and treaty (past US mistakes do not justify Russia's present transgression). By doing so, Putin will justifiably be held under suspicion, and the Russian people will suffer just when they need the kind of trust that promotes investment in their ailing economy.","Trust but verify, the old Russian adage runs. And if my admiration for Reagan has limits, he knew how to deal with the Soviet Union: outspend them...Russia has much at stake: to keep Ukraine (on its borders) sympathetic. The US-EU coalition has much at stake: to keep a buffer between Russia and central Europe, to insure the flow of commerce and energy. All win if we achieve Ukrainian neutrality between Russia and the West. Ukraine has much to gain too...Let us hope that President Putin is sincere, but let us also see concrete steps: the end of Russian military exercises on its western border. Then we countenance reincorporation of Russia into the community of nations. President Obama has played this hand well; he must not let his guard down (and I doubt he will, given the events of the last month).","Putin won't stop unless he realizes the gravity of what he's done (as if annexing Crimea wasn't enough)...Halt all diplomatic relations with Russia and stop flights between Russian and the US, whether Russian or American carriers. Bring our citizens back from Russian, and expel all Russian citizens on visas. That's the only message that megalomaniac will understand.","If, as it now appears from satellite photos and intercepted phone calls, Russian separatists in Ukraine are responsible for this despicable act, and if the Russian government supplied the armaments that did this, we must take strong action:..1. Recall the American ambassador to Russia and our entire diplomatic corp...2. Summon the Russian ambassador to the White House and expel him along with all his staff and the consular corps across the US, giving them 24 hours to vacate...3. Halt flights by Russian aircraft to the US and American flights to Russia...4. Deny any current visas to the US issued to Russian nationals, and withdraw all current visas. Send them all home, and bring all US citizens in Russia home...This is a heinous act, and Putin has the blood of innocents on his hands, as much as Ivan the Terrible and Boris Godunov did.","Does it bother anybody else that Kerry turned his plane around at Putin's invitation to meet with Lavrov? The reply should have been: We'll talk when you return Crimea to Ukraine (or at least to independent status), pull your massed troops back from the border, and cease 'military exercises' on your western front, and not until then...Putin's suggestion for more regional autonomy in Ukraine's eastern provinces just repeats, more or less, what he's just done in Crimea. If Kiev were to grant it, those provinces would also become part of Russia sooner rather than later.",Putin's Russia doesn't hearken back to the Soviet era but back to the imperial one. He (and any ideologues who support him) will suffer the fate of the Romanovs: xenophobia will result in isolation that ultimately will have undermining economic (and therefore political) consequences...The notion that Russia hopes to draw China into its sphere of influence is macabre. The Chinese are too smart and too canny in business to alienate their largest market: the US...Those who advocate isolation (in whatever nationalist cause) will ultimately fail. That's the underlying internationalist truth history teaches us over the past three centuries.,"Russia (and its oligarchy) can ill afford economic sanctions. On the other hand, I would tend to doubt that Boehner, Reid, and the rest have substantial investments in Russia or money in Russian banks (what's the ruble worth?)...This action sends just the right message: a measured response with the President suggesting that it's not too late for Putin to accept a diplomatic solution (and that there's more coming if this goes further).","What would constitute a strong response?:..1. Summon the US ambassador from Moscow to confer...2. Call an emergency meeting of the UNC Security Council for statements that will shame Putin in public...3. Western leaders should refuse under these circumstances to attend the G8 summit in Sochi...4. Consider economic sanctions, such as freezing Russian assets in US banks...We have no military options, but we have plenty of leverage in other ways.","Just a matter of time before Putin overplays his hand (if he hasn't already): this will spread alarm among former Soviet satellites, resistance in Western Europe, in Japan (a traditional foe of Russia), and in China (with its own separatist problems and a substantial border with Russia)...Putin could have played this well and reaped an economic bounty.

VHZ,,,,"Some of us, American citizens, really have our own opinions.  In brief, I don't believe for a minute that Putin wants Ukraine.  He just didn't want NATO ships in Sevastopol. The sensible thing in Ukraine would have been for the West to encourage the country to wait a year for elections.   Perhaps I am naive, but rather than seeing Putin as a dictator, I think he is just a cool-brained, very, very experienced CEO of a gigantic country facing down a revolving door of Western meddlers and sorority girls.  The US is scarcely blameless here.","This attitude is exactly, exactly why Putin speaks and acts as he does.  He has a gigantic responsibility to a huge nation, and although the mind-set of the Russian people may be incomprehensible to us in the West, we owe respect to a leader who is supported so heavily by his own people, and who legitimately questions the motivations of the West as they constantly encroach into countries on its own borders. Calling the very legitimate leader of a huge continent--or two--a thug is precisely the wrong tack to take.  I want my paycheck and my comfortable life in the US.  But I know that there are masses of people whose national pride trumps having a 3000 sf house in the suburbs.  It may be that the Russian nation has a 19th century mentality:  they read books!  Lots of them!  They know more American literature than we do.  The Russian oligarch who faces US sanctions laughed and said that he needed three things, two of which were Allen Ginsburg and Jackson Pollock:  I suspect anyone in the US under the age of 40 doesn't have a clue about Allen Ginsburg.  My point here is that Russians LIKE the 19th century.  That doesn't make them thugs.  Give that huge and very great nation, which worships at another altar, its respect and its due and maybe we can avoid these conflicts.","DaMo is exactly right:  Putin isn't trying so much to protect Sevastopol as he's trying to be a placeholder, to keep NATO out.  NATO--what on earth are they doing so far east?  Shouldn't everybody just stay home?  Open some factories, read a book, eat a piece of fruit....",,,,,,,

Mark Morss,,,,"There are two big problems with the Sudenland analogy.  ..The first is that the Nazis were always going to start a war to control Europe; in hindsight, it was only a question of when it would be fought.  Putin's maximal objective is to reconstruct an approximation of the old Soviet Union based upon the principle of reincorporating territories where ethnic Russians are a majority.  This would be unpleasant to many, but it is a program nowhere near as ambitious as Hitler's...Second, Russia is a nuclear power.  War between Russia and the West is not an option.  There must not occur even so much as a naval skirmish in the Black Sea or an aerial dogfight over the Ukraine. ..Clear headedness, a sense of what Western interests are truly indispensible, and a non-theatening military stance are important now.",I think that Putin's banning nine Americans from travelling in Russia is a rather sarcastic way of pointing out the absurdity of Obama's sanctions.,,,,,,,,

The claim is that Nazis made a coup; the observable reality is that some of the people now in power are Jews. And then we evince our skepticism that Jews are Nazis or that a Nazi coup would put Jews at the top of the Ukrainian state apparatus..But in the ideology of the Soviet Union and its communist allies, the identification of Jews with Nazis was convenient for those who were in power, and so Jewish Nazis became a propaganda reality. In the years before Stalins death Israel became part of an international plot that was directed by fascists in the capitalist West. After the Six-Day War the Soviets presented Israeli soldiers and citizens as imitators of the Wehrmacht and the SS. This propaganda was followed by the expulsion of Jews from communist Poland. The fact that Jews left Poland for Israel and the US was presented as evidence that they were fascists all along. The regimes found it politically useful for their own future to target Jews, and therefore Jews, so to speak, were made to become Nazis.",,,,,,,,

And some commenters claiming to write from the U.S. maybe part of Putin's propaganda machine, whereby individuals are reportedly paid to do his bidding.  ..However, I sense that there are many decent people who are expressing their views in good faith, having been duped by the aforementioned spin doctors.  They seem to be unaware of the wider context of what Russia has been up to in neighboring countries in recent years: from instituting trade sanctions and restrictions and sowing ethnic discord on trumped-up pretexts to punish moves away from Russia and toward Europe, to demonizing opponents and perceived political threats as fascists, while aiding and abetting its own right-wing extremists for political gain.  ..As others have reported, in many ways today's Russia resembles a fascist state more than Ukraine, with its free press and political competition, ever will.","Why should criticism of and actions against Putin's money men and against corruption at home be mutually exclusive?

In the face of Russia's military invasion and annexation of Crimea, should it not be seen as admirable by those in favor of peace that nonviolent responses are being proposed and utilized?","What makes the Russian focus on Ukrainian anti-Semitism especially hypocritical is the long history of similar attitudes and actions in Russia itself before and after the revolution of 1917, not to mention its prevalence in present-day Russia.  The Putin Administration is not above tolerating, if not tacitly encouraging, anti-Semitic-tinged Russian nationalism for its own political purposes, some of which is alluded to in Timothy Snyder's fascinating article that appeared on the website of the New York Review of Books in February (<a hrefhttp:www.nybooks.comarticlesarchives2014mar20fascism-russia-and-ukraine) titlehttp:www.nybooks.comarticlesarchives2014mar20fascism-russia-and-ukraine) targetblank>http:www.nybooks.comarticlesarchives2014mar20fascism-russia-and-...<a>.",,,,
AJ,,,,"Many, many years ago, in undergraduate school, I took a Russian History class, from a brilliant professor, who had recently escaped from cold war Russia. His lectures were spell binding, but what I most remember about the course, was a question I asked about their economic system and his answer. He listened attentively, sat on his desk, and said in a kindly manner, your question is intelligent and I will try to answer it, but please understand, the Western mind will never understand the Russian mind---watching Putin operate, his answer still stands.","Follow the money---or the lack thereof in Russian banks. Putin is a bully, but he does understand when his playground is being sold around him. If he could only grasp the idea that a strong diversified economy is his best weapon for his nationalistic dreams --but that is asking a lot of a playground bully.","Amazing to see a major European power run by Tony Soprano. A single economic law of nature is the role diversity plays in your policies and portfolio. Placing all your bets on one resource and one strategy (I have an offer you can't refuse) in the end will fail economically, and ultimately will fail politically. What Putin doesn't get is a countries greatest resource is its people --building the necessary social capital to become competitive in a diverse marketplace, but no, he places all bets on pipelines, oil and gas. I do not think this story will end well for him.","Markets can be crueller than a Russian winter, as Mr. Putin is finding out.",,,,,,
Steamboater,,,,"Ukraine has admitted as much that Russia has in effect annexed now the eastern part of Ukraine.  Putin must be dancing with glee but beware Vlad, what you've done is to have insured an eventual Ukraine sans what you've stolen, as part of a wall of NATO and right in your face. ..The gangs in the east in support of a Putin want no negotiations with the Ukrainian government. If they did, they wouldn't have taken international observers as hostages nor left those who want no part of Russian annexation floating like refuse in the rivers of the east...It's no coincidence that it appeared as if every male in the east in favor of joining Russia all of a sudden had camo uniforms and masks and high tech weaponry, complete with masks. Such brave men they are, beating peaceful protesters waving Ukrainian flags who were in support of union and dialogue and beating them with bats and iron rods. That is the Russia anyone in Ukraine can look forward to if they do not tow Putin's line. A certain female group name P Riot can attest to that. They too were beaten and whipped by Putin's cossacks in Sochi at the Olympics when making a music video in the street.  If there's anything good to come out of this, it's that eventually when there's no innocents left to push around and abuse and worse, these Russian gangs will turn on each other. Karma and history demands it.","This is totally out of hand and it's already too late to speak of even common sense to take hold. Putin played his dirty hand with the Crimea and by fostering talk among Russian speaking Ukrainians in Eastern Ukraine about unity with Russia and that talk turned into action.  It's highly unlikely Putin even wants to hold back more annexation of Ukrainian territory too; he's just trying to play it both ways and in doing so is playing the west.  Russia has always been a byzantine mess and all of this is just another example of Russian intrigue played out on a west too accepting of Russian good will. Putin can now send his troops rolling over the Ukrainian border, and in doing so tell the west that he's just trying to bring calm to the situation in order to convince those who want to join Russia that it's not such a good idea after all.  Putin may be a character out of Saturday Night Live but his intentions are lethal for anyone who stands in his way.","Putin never wanted Ukraine, just a chunk of it and a chunk of it he had no right to get--the Crimea.","So Putin gives truth to his lies about not having invaded Ukraine, and the proof is that the guy who pulled the trigger on Ukraine is the one who made this ceasefire agreement with Ukraine. Never trust a thief though. They always want more and that kidnapping of an Estonian officer by the Russians is but a pretext for more aggression on Estonia, with Russia blaming Estonia of having crossed Russia's border to do Russia harm. The Crimea, eastern Ukraine and now Estonia, it's all so Hitlerian. ..Sanctions have hurt Russia but obviously Putin doesn't feel enough pain yet. Putin needs to know that the severest sanctions will hit Russia if that Estonian officer isn't released and sent home within 48 hours.  If not, this is only going to get much worse.","Putin is a relic of the Soviet Union who with a few close cronies still in awe of an imperial Russia albeit under a red flag refuse to recognize that the world has passed them by. Thousands of protesters took to the streets to protest Putin's land grab of Ukrainian territory and they were met with an equal crowd supporting Putin's theft of the Crimea. That thousands could still protest on Russian streets against Putin, for the time being at least, represents Russia's only hope for a future untainted by a heavy and brutal hand.  Still, Cossacks wield their whips and violently attack protesters  in the Crimea and Putin's favorite biker gang rides roughshod with Russian troops amid Crimean streets. While an American or NATO military response is very dangerous indeed and could bring a good chunk of the world to nuclear annihilation, we can teach Russia and Putin a lesson in the common good they'll never forget. ..The Crimea is gone into Russia's bloody hand, while Eastern Ukraine is threatened with a build-up of Russian troops on it's border and it is likely Putin will move them into Ukraine. He cares not for intellectual observations or diplomacy but has the intellectual patience and mindset of a thug. He will strike and simply because he can do it. ..We need to isolate Russia and attack her economy specifically. When Russians begin to feel the pain, they no longer will look paranoid at the west as the cause of their problems but set their eyes on the Kremlin.","Dont let Putin crush the model that Ukraine is trying to build, otherwise Russia will never change...And that's the rub. Russia will never change. As long as there's no free flow of information and therefore no free elections and information is one-sided in favor of what Putin wants every Russian to hear, Russia remains a backward society doomed to nationalism and the low self esteem of the bully on the edge of the eastern Europe block, determined to make it's neighbors live in fear. ..Russian military decked out in camos assume the guise of Ukrainian citizens and international observers are taken hostage, yet we're supposed to believe that none of this was done at Putin's directive? International laws are violated day after day and the White House believes if we can just hold out another week etc Putin will react reasonable because after all, Putin is such a reasonable man. ..Full sanctions on Putin personally and military ones were in order long ago.  Is it going to take a full scale Russian invasion across Ukraine's borders in prime time for Obama to get it and finally come to realize that Ukraine's borders have already been violated by Russia and that Putin didn't even need 500 tanks to do it?  To let this go on until far worse happens without full sanctions only makes us look foolish. Wishful thinking isn't going to stop Putin.  Stop trying to treat Putin as really the bad little boy can behave given time. Unfortunately, for Ukraine, time has likely already run out.","Massing Russian troops on Ukraine's eastern border could simply be the bullying big Russian bear flexing his muscles and thumping his chest in an attempt to make everyone fear Russia. After all, Putin and his ilk have a nostalgia for a Russia that is feared more than respected. Then again, this could mean an imminent invasion of the Ukraine and an invasion of Ukraine when Ukraine is at her most vulnerable. Frankly, it's both. Commentators and pundits were shocked when Putin had his troops invade the Crimea, as if Putin never had a track record with brutally invading Georgia, so now we get the same naive responses to Russian troops in place to pounce on eastern Ukraine. Naivete, wishful thinking or just fear, we need to put aside our perceptions of heads of state as all rationale with diplomatic demeanors. Some of them, like Putin, are simply gangsters.","The referendum in the Crimea is a tragic farce. Voters do not even have the opportunity to vote NO to Russia, just whether to vote to join with Russia or join with Russia at some future time. There is no option to vote NO to join Russia and therefore NO to Putin. Why expect a fair election there at all anyway since in Russia there aren't any fair elections. When the press is stifled and the voice heard is predominately Putin's voice, there's no free flow of information and therefore no free elections. Any reporter gets in the way and what's happened? That reporter is conveniently done away with. As bad as Krushchev was, at least we could deal with him and he knew when to pull back. Not so with Putin. It's been reported he's made this decision to land grab the Crimea in cahoots with two or three of his old KGB cronies, as if a bunch of drunks were sitting around and making decisions without a clue as to the risks involved. So will Putin invade eastern Ukraine? Probably so, and then the deluge because who is next? The world needs to make Putin a pariah and isolate Russia economically as much as it can. Once the ogliarchs start feeling the economic pinch, they'll turn on Putin. Fighting him from within is the best way to bring Putin down.",,
Sunny 20,,,,"No, Mike, avoid a war over Ukraine or other Eastern European nations Putin is being emboldened to go after. Stop him now by meaningful sanctions, real isolation, and a military threat, or fight a bigger war later: you choose.","The first warning shot was fired. Obama did nothing. The next warning shot was fired, Crimea was annexed, and Obama did nothing. The third warning shot has been fired. Russia will reconsider its stance on Iran's nuclear capability. Still Obama blathers about the international community,  does not revoke Russia's most favored nation status, and blabs on and on about how tough he is. The appeasers and apologists writing Comments here are playing right into Putin's hands, and empowering the weak and hopelessly nave President to think his lack of resolve is a good thing. Make no mistake: taking military options off the table is a terrible strategy. Breaching our Treaty obligations to Ukraine is a terrible thing.Tie our hands, watch Putin roam. Obama's destruction of nearly 60 years of diplomatic success is almost complete, Russia is on the march, Iran will have a nuclear bomb, China will take Pacific islands, the Middle East will explode. and America is the worse for it all. Appeasement never works.","OK Augusto: 1. Void most favored nation status;2. Place missiles in Eastern Poland; 3. Immediately, not later, expel Russia from G8; 4. Send warships to the area to support Ukraine withdrawal; Leave military response on the table (never try to appease a bully); Send military lethal equipment to Ukraine; Tell Putin we honor our treaties, even at the risk of war, let him then take the risk: Free oil and gas reserves here to supply Europe; Promote our natural gas and oil reserves as a fail safe to Europe; Freeze Russian assets here; Say what you mean and mean what you say; Get his head out of ....; Lead, not follow; Get off the golf course and out of the ESPN studio. Enough?","Excellent piece, but I was waiting for a bigger conclusion. Perhaps some reference to Obama dismantling nuclear deterrents 4 years ahead of schedule as an invitation to Putin to stuff another one in the net. How about voicing what is becoming painfully obvious: we have a President who is doing his best to weaken America, weaken Europe, and permit lawlessness to succeed; that the world is in danger because of appeasement and unintelligible goals. We need the Friedmans to speak the whole truth, not shy away from criticizing the Annointed One. We are in trouble, and columns like this need to be more outspoken. No, we are not serious, might be a good start toward very much needed change we can believe in.",,,,,,
richard schumacher,,,,"What rubbish.  Russia had no qualms about NATO for 20 years; Putin attended NATO summits, for heaven's sake. He only started worrying about Sevastopol when his puppet was pushed out of Kiev by a popular revolt.","No matter what happens Putin needs to believe that he was, is, and will be in control, and he needs to believe that everyone else thinks so also.",This will not help end the incursion.  In Putin's mindset setbacks only harden resolve.,Putin has won at least one million people who think that Mother Russia owes them a living.  Good luck with that.,,,,,,
john rocha jr.,,,,"When have geopolitics been effective at stopping anything that Russia planned? The only thing Russia fears is nuclear catastrophe something that Putin said could take place in Ukraine before coming up with this peace plan. We should be wary of anything that comes from Putin. These events in Ukraine demonstrate that traditional geopolitics strategies are not working. I do not like saying this but it is so. With Europe at its western borders this is the only thing Russia will respect in the future knowing a full frontal assault is possible under such conditions elsewhere as these in Ukraine. NATO and European Union are moving towards this kind of response if Russia does something like this ever again. Putin has forced Ukraine's hand to push for relations with the EU that allows them the possibilities of coming under the NATO umbrella and the promises that becoming a member of the EU will provide. Putin has actively encouraged the buildups in NATO strengths that are being considered at this very moment for any such future advance as in Ukraine. A rapid deployment force has always been the basis for any action of this type. However this has been allowed to weaken since the Russian defeat at the end of the Cold War. Ukraine caught everyone by surprise. This only permits the strengthening of EU forces nearer to Russian Federation borders. Is this what Russia wanted, what Putin wanted before this escapade?",From the point of Crimea on Russia has insinuated itself into everything that happens in the Donbass region of Ukraine but Putin staunchly denies this despite the evidence proffered by witnesses that can show otherwise. It is on this position that inclines me to worry ablut any actions proposed to settle the crisis that the Donbass region is to Kiev by Putin and his allies. Just what it is to be done depends on how these differences play on either side. It matters less what the separatists claim and demand than what goals Putin has set for himself and his fellow Russians that are involved in Donbass. Crimea is lost butthe Donbass region is very much up in the air. Poroshenko's Kiev government has been forced ti retreat repeatedly because of Russia's non existent armor.,"Any negotiations that take place between Kiev and the separatists have to equate the highly visible role that the Russians have played in all of these affairs. This started with the fall of Yanukovych and his kleptocracy that aided Putin's position in the Ukraine by initiating a broken government and enabled that there be no fighting in Crimea when it was annexed to Russia. It took awhile but Poroshenko was eventually chosen to be president. The instabilities of the Ukrainian government are through no faults of Poroshenko's own. He has attempted to manage this crisis with what he knows, but his government is still faced with elections in the near future. This places stress on Ukraine's government to do what is right for Ukraine and could position it to work in favor of Putins goals and ambitions for Ukraine. The bloodshed so far has been reported to be approximately 2600. The sacrifices possibly should have been more if there was open warfare between Ukraine and Russia. The separatists have been bearing the brunt of the fighting except where they have found themselves in trouble. Then the Russians have taken over to repulse the Ukrainian armies. I do not know the current status of the Ukrainian army as",Let's play this game of ceasefire. The separatists were being defeated a few days ago now they are on an offensive? What role do the Russians play if they are not center stage to thecurrent positions of the separatist armies? Why do they need the ceasefire plan that Putin has set forth? This plan is in line with the game that Putin is playing in Ukraine. It is a respite for Putin to gain his jndeclared goals in Ukraine. Why should it matter tl him what happens to the separatists except as the reason for his actions there? Argue with a madman and see what happens. This is an insult towards V. Putin. It is up to him to restore the peace that used to exist in Ukraine. I am not attacking any of the commenters on this medium. I am saying what it is that I have seen over the past months that I have been watching this. It is his army that holds the reins to whether this war will end. And it is up to him what they shall do in Ukraine.,"We are living in a bad time. Over much of the world there are wars being fought. These wars against terror are much to blame for this sorry state of affairs. Who pressed the button is less and less likely to be found, but it is only human tendency to ascribe blame on those people hindering the investigation of the downing of MH17 over Ukrainean territory. People are not blinded by this sort of reaction to cold blooded murder. The Russians have shown the proRussian separatist what they can do to secure their independence from Kiev. Do they have the organization to make good on their attempts at independence from Kiev? Do they accept the consequences for their actions? People have died so there is no turning back. They cannot reverse what they have done. Yanukovych atarted this but it is not wise to blame him for this response by the 'Soviets' under the guises of Putin's past membership in the KGB. We are doing what is best to not have open warfare break out in Ukraine but the realities of this failing are there for everyone to see. These pro separatists are mercenary in their allegiances. If they succeed it will only be for the help from Putin and his gambols with the west.","These other big messes figure into the Russian game chiefly as distraction away from what is being done in Ukraine by Russian Federation. The end game is about what the RF may do short of inspiring the use of nuclear weapons. Noone wants this kind of war, especially Poroshenko. Putin is playing Poroshenko for a fool talking to himbut with little to agree towards a solution of the difficulties they face in the ongoing conflict in the region of Ukraine. V. Putin knows what he has done to encourage the violence. He may be looking for a route to an annexed Crimea by overland from RF. These effects just add to the difficulties in the situation that Ukraine poses.",We can look at MH 17 and J. Foley. Boots on the ground are not going to resolve the problems in Ukraine. This is the apparent will of President Obama. How far is Putin going to go? That is the subject of discussion about Ukraine. Will that Russian soldier be decapitated? I doubt it but at what price is this little discussion focused on? Even if the filters are on the items do not reach our enemies. This is a local problem that needs to be spoken of and about. I don't want to have nightmares because apparently my world is coming to an end as may the case be in Ukraine. Iraq and Syria are child's play as is perhaps truly the case there. In Iraq and Syria the people there are truly children because they choose war and a decapitated enemy over peace. Can we discuss Ukraine with all of the distraction that is happening with Islamic State? There are people that would have the world to genuinely end during the night such that they would not know the final price that these games are leading towards. Life is not to be discussed in this way. Or is it?,Kiev's forces are already withdrawing away from the Russian forces in the Donbass region. How will they defend their lands in full retreat? There is some violence but mostly Kiev has not been able to stand in the face of Russian troops and armor... especially the armor. Europe has to take a stand or Putin will push all the way to Ukraine's western borders. Then who knows where it will lead? I have already taken the situation too far but what is happening in Ukraine? The annexation of Crimea set up everything that is happening to Ukraine. All we can do is set sanctions that may not work. Everyone is afraid of nuclear war but that alternative is most definitely off the table so Putin gets his way.,"Putin has refused military aid to Donetsk and Luhansk because, and I hesitate to say this, the leaders are in fact of Russian origin and that they are defended by Russian troops.",I disagree. It was reported that Putin had the support of the Russian people when the annexation of Crimea was taking place. This cannot all be propaganda. Putin did get what he wanted in Crimea. Poroshenko will probably and most likely be hardpressed if he tries to get Crimea back without consideration for what occurs n eastern Ukraine. The larger picture matters less as more and more time passes without Poroshenko being able to retake Crimea back from Russia. I like to talk about the idea of a 'line-of-control' being formed somewhere in Ukraine as has occured in Kashmir between India and Pakistan but if it comes down to it there might be possible that this occur if an attitude occurs that Russia not take any more of  Ukraine than it already has. This would seem like an impasse where both sides throw soldiers against each other with little give or take except in the loss of life. If the taking of Luhansk and Donetsk by Poroshenko can occur without furtherinterference from Russia then perhaps this need not occur. If this cannot be done it will inflame the angers of more than Ukraine and the RF. It will invite further retributions from the west if they do not stay away from these disagreements. Russia is strong enough to stand alone but will it occur.
Bill Eisen,,,,"Whether Putin seeks to divide Ukraine any further remains to be seen as Putin, like Obama, has a history of saying one thing and doing the opposite...Putin and Obama have both been a disaster for their country's respective economies.  Only the rich, including oligarchs and giant corporations, are doing well. And this is also true for Ukraine where the GNP is actually less than it was in 1991.",I guess that hope springs eternal for the German foreign minister and the other Western leaders who aren't willing to do anything but hope that Putin picks up his marbles and goes back to Russia with his troops...If Putin keeps it up there won't be much left of the Ukrainian towns and villages that are being laid to waste by his artillery - all so Putin can plant a Russian flag atop the destroyed buildings and factories.   ..I've got the sinking feeling that Putin thinks that it's World War II again when soldiers fought and died to conquer every square meter of land.,"So when is a war not a war? I suppose it's when Putin says.it isn't - even while Russia is sending heavy weaponry to the separatists, while Russia is sending its fighter jets into eastern Ukraine to down Ukrainian jets and while Russia is sending missile batteries into eastern Ukraine to down high flying passenger jets as a warning to the West to keep out of Ukrainian air space.  ..Meanwhile, Ukrainian president Poroshenko's idea of confronting the separatists is to mount artillery barrages on separatist controlled towns causing hundreds of civilian deaths. I suppose that's about all that can be expected of a billionaire oligarch who owns a chocolate factory in Russia.","If, as the Kremlin's press secretary states, Russia cannot physically agree on a cease-fire, as it is not a side in the conflict then why is Putin even  proposing a cease fire?  It seems that we've seen this movie before...So, in the meantime, I would think that Kiev would want to fortify the port city of Mariupol as much as possible and hope that the French don't deliver a Mistral naval assault ship that could help Putin take control of Mariupol and the adjoining Ukrainian coastal areas.","This so-called agreement must be taken with a grain of salt as Russia's persistent denials that it is endeavoring to take control of eastern Ukraine are hardly credible. I wonder if Putin realizes just how ridiculous his statements actually are. Unfortunately, he's still living in the past world of the old Soviet Union and cold war, and the Russian people are suffering as a result.","Yeah......Putin would like to convince Kiev that it has no choice but to negotiate, not fight, and that the overall outcome depends on Putin who boasts that he could take Kiev in 2 weeks.   But could he hold on to it in the face of active resistance?  That would be difficult.  For example, Russia couldn't hold on to Afghanistan after invading it and has had trouble with the independence movement in Chechnya.",U.S. defense officials still don't know Putin's intentions. Perhaps it's because Putin doesn't even know. He seems to be playing it one step at a time. So he called Obama to get a better feel for where the US is at. But Putin's obviously not satisfied with just taking Crimea. Otherwise he wouldn't be massing troops on Ukraine's eastern borders and elsewhere. ..The Russian bear needs to be tamed again. But it won't happen if western European countries continue cutting their defense budgets.,"Putin's denials that Russian troops, masquerading as rebels or separatists, have invaded Ukraine and are actively fighting Ukrainian troops there are starting to ring more and more hollow as the body bags are being returned to Russia.      ..Russia should, of course, be encouraged to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.  As long as they remain there can be no lasting peace.",Whether this peace deal will hold remains to be seen.  Putin seems more interested in destabilizing Ukraine and biting off chunks of it for annexation than in a lasting peace.,Reminds me of Hitler's march into Austria.    Putin's on a roll and the more he gets the more he wants.    There's no telling where it will stop short of another world war.  History repeats itself.  When will we ever learn?
Jo Boost,,,,"What happened in Ukraine is a part of much wider, complex General Plan..And the Oil War is integral part of it..Talking of Mr. Putin's War is a plain and open LIE!.Yes, Mr. Putin feels threatened - not only by a McNamara-style Containment - but worse: a military 'Ring of Steel' from the Arctic via Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Estonia, ... Poland ... and now: Ukraine and Georgia ... to Azerbaidzhan, Turkmenistan, Kirkyztan, Tadzhikistan (and Afghanistan, Pakistan) - all the way to China..Think of the Cuba-fear in the USA. And Putin should sit there with a smile?.But he hasn't even done anything to bring about this crisis! It was the false US-tactics in Kiev, the alliance with open Fascists (who did a massacre on the Maidan, claimed it was the President, and started a putsch)..Those people are in power there now..But that got people moving - away from Kiev - away from people they could not trust - and never will:.Let's face it: If the US and NATO marched in there to help their poor little friends (with Nazi SS signs on their helmets) - what do they think the result would be? Think of the Maidan - but this massacre would be much bigger - Srebrenica would be a Sunday school outing..Those helmets and their insignia are not without meaning. They were seen in Ukraine at an earlier time, and the Ukrainian nationalist SS did80 of the mass murder of Baby Yar.

But, Crimea is a Russian base, the warm water port for a useless navy of a once great power. The insecurities of all are flaring. Obama is in Kerry's hands. Kerry is doing well. But, we must not rip Obama for doing the most intelligent thing in Syria. There, again, we find Putin causing trouble for the people of Syria, for all, but that mess is beyond analysis. Less is more, may patience will out. Obama's answer re chemical weapons was ingenious. Again, less is more. With Ukraine we have Barroso, IMF, US, and calmer heads, with Obama doing less directly himself - which is more. Germany will help, with attention Putin will calm down. Putin shot himself in the foot - in Crimea, his evidence, simply dishonest, his troops traveling incognito are a joke. Putin has a trigger.

He already had the naval base..Was he just pushing Obama? Because he knew what he could get away with? One can't say it was an election year ploy for more votes!.Of course we could say let him have it...they ARE mostly Russian. But more importantly...there isn't much anyone can do. That ridiculous attempt yesterday by Obama to look like he was doing something backfired in his face when those named laughed at him..So now, Putin knows there is nothing anyone can do....What does he eye next?",Maybe that's what Obama was telling Putin before the election.,"This is what happens when Putin gives his war toys to rebels....Lesson to learn from as we look at Syria, Libya, etc...","Is Putin losing? Is he acting out of desperation?.You forget... Or fail to mention... That the only one originally bringing up such silly concepts is Obama, who is proving to have the worst concept of US foreign policy...possibly ever by a US president. Due to Obama's complete failure abroad, Putin is on e again acting unilaterally without any fear whatsoever. Does anyone even remember Obama's empty threats of harmful sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine? As we all should know, war... Or supplying arms in conflicts is great for an economy. Putin obviously realizes it. Ah well... One more year. Then more HOPE and CHANGE all over again.",Hoped for a peaceful resolution?.What else could he possibly do? Putin knows his history. He also knows Americans are tired of sending their loved ones to war. He also knows Obama is no Kennedy..He's still hoping for a peaceful resolution? Like the one in Syria?.Please! The hollow gong of ineffective leadership rings again.,,,,
Mark Thomason,,,,"This is pure Cold War talk, complete with Thatcher's warning against going wobbly...Dial it back. ..The only Russian talk of nuclear weapons was about basing them in their main fleet base in Crimea. No serious person could ever have believed they did not always have nuclear weapons in what has been their main base in the region since the late 1700's. Like the US, they usually don't comment, and the comment is the only change. The comment itself only said maybe so it wasn't much of a change. That just doesn't rise to Cold War nuclear crazy...Putin is fixated on the US surrounding Russia. But then, the US has been exploiting its victory by doing just that. Maybe we were right to do so, maybe not, but denying we've been doing it is just fantasy. It was all about preventing the rise of any peer competitor in the future, meaning Russia and China...This newspaper carried some of the triumphalist reports of US victory in the Maiden events. Once Putin took that as a challenge, it because no, we didn't. Well, we were pretty clear we did until we found Putin stepping up to that as a challenge. We expected to get another unchallenged color revolution, a process of which our State Dept is quite proud...Now a true color revolution is a good thing for the people freed from oppression. Still, it is what it is, and denying it is shall we say counterfactual...We need truth, and perspective, to get through this. Cold War calls about wobbly aren't what we need.","But Russian intervention would most likely prolong and complicate the war, as it would keep Mr. Assad in office and would add Russian forces to those already on Syrian missions...That assumes the insurgents will win, and the war will end only when Assad leaves. That is not the only possibility. ISIS and al Qaeda are crazy, and so while effective in the short term at motivation, they are too crazy to function as long term winners (even we hope and expect that)...Also notice that the Russian authorization for the use of force is exactly what the West did in Libya. Air Force only, no ground troops...That is doubly important because:..1) It limits the Russian commitment the same way the same limitation limits American re-commitment. It is an offset to our no-boots support, not a flood of boots on the ground...2) Putin in person and the Russians more generally have been very angry about what the West did in Libya with its authorization just like the one they just did. We can expect payback in kind. That is how such things work...Finally, extensive Russian air operations would end all no-fly zones projects. We might have told Assad he can't fly. We are not going to tell the Russians they can't fly. If we tried it would turn out badly...Payback is come, from Russians, and from ISIS and al Qaeda. This is the world created by Bush and Cheney. And yes, Obama did not end it as promised, and Hillary as Sec of State had done it in full, so they are not free of responsibility either.","they are not really threatened by Islamic terrorism the way we are..True, it is certainly not the same. But in some important ways it is worse for them...What passes for their legitimacy at home is their demonstration of  effective strength. Terrorism undermines their very core...In the West terrorism has been used to incite the Western governments to do things that will alienate their people, the sort of foolish over reach that was done by Bush and friends, as for example the Patriot Act. But that is at best a secondary effect, and has never bee successful in undermining a Western democracy. In authoritarian countries, it cuts right at the primary source of government power over its own system...They can no more prevent acts of terrorism than can anybody else. A police state is not especially effective. It is fearful, alienated from its own people, and ultimately less effective in controlling its alienated minority communities from which terrorists come, from which they draw their protections and support...One of Putin's motives he admits is fear of terrorism come home to his own Muslim regions.","A gentler Putin and a more intelligent Obama could arrive at such an arrangement, but Obama lacks intelligence and Putin lacks gentleness..Obama is very smart.  Putin is very realistic, which works well enough in place of gentleness.  They can do it.  McCain and screaming partisans are doing their best to prevent them working this out.","Putin did not do the Olympics to impress somebody in Connecticut or Michigan.  He did it to impress Russians, and he succeeded.  ..Now he has impressed Russians again.  The polls put him over 72 with them, soaring.  ..That is all he cares about.  What we think of him matters to him not at all.","Any crime - causing an airliner crash..This buys into the paranoid conspiracy theory that Russia caused the crash of the Polish President's plane. It disregarded ground control and tried to land in a fog without the proper equipment available to do that. Only the Polish right wing believes it is Russia's fault. Repeating this discredits the rest...Russia must import capital to grow the Russian economy...Russia has no national debt, and a surplus of circa 100 billion in the bank. Russia is controlled by a fabulously wealthy kleptocracy. There is no shortage of money in Russia. We'd like to get in there and profit too. Maybe they'd like us to send money and let them skim it by their corruption, but they don't need it to get along...There is no military question that NATO equipment and troops are coming to Eastern Europe. Putin has caused these deployments..NATO moved first. Russia is reacting. It's not just me saying that, old line guys like Kissinger and George Kennan said that, and many more serious people like them who recommended we not do what we did...Putin's reaction is violent and aggressive, but it is a reaction. We don't have that excuse for how we let our hawks continue the Cold War...Eastern Europe is not a colony, not of Russia, and not ours either. It is a land between, and Russia feels threatened by our moving in on Russia. To them it isn't about those places, it is about NATO moving in on Russia. That explains what they do, not some colonialist drive.","It would help our understanding of events to see Putin the way Russians see him...First, they are not stupid. They see what we see...Second, their experience of government was Russian government:..That meant crazy Czars who held the population as semi-slaves (serfs) tied to the land and essentially owned by the landowners, forbidden to leave...Then it meant Stalin, who was one of history's great monsters...Then it meant utterly hopeless incompetent bureaucrats who fell apart...Then it meant drunken Yeltsin, who sold off the country to kleptocrats and left everybody ruined, many actually going hungry for the first time in their lives...Finally it meant Putin, who for all his faults got things running again. ..They are not choosing between Putin and JFK or Lincoln. They are chooing between Putin and Stalin, or a hopeless drunk. Putin is better, which is why he is so wildly popular just now...However, Russians are not stupid. Putin may be better than anything that has gone before in Russia, but they can see what we see. He is a transitional figure...This is George Kennan's type of problem. We just wait out the transition. They'll get there if we don't head it off by doing something stupid first.","This is misleading...It may be that 6,000 people have been killed in the Ukraine fighting, but Russia and Putin count the same way the US counts in Iraq. ..We counted our own uniformed forces of circa 4,500 killed. We did not count the half again more of our own contractors killed, nor the Iraqis forces killed fighting on our side, nor the enemies we killed, nor the civilians killed caught in the fighting. We debate if that all was tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions...In the same way, for Putin and Russia, Ukraine is a most a few hundred dead...I hate both wars. I don't say this to justify either one. However, it is misleading to think in one way about Russia, and the other way about what we are doing. Understanding the truth is to see both the same way...Likewise, it is misleading to say that Russia gives up on modernizing. We may think they'll never modernize on their current path, and we may be right to think that. But that isn't what they think about what they are doing. They think they are modernizing. They say so often...This also misleads by assuming that China views Russia the same way we view Russia. China does not view much of anything the same way we do. Judging by their actions instead of our assumptions, they are taking Russia very seriously, putting their money into that, and standing together diplomatically...From these misleading assumptions, Cohen concludes we must give up on Russia. That factual basis for his conclusion is flawed.","One heavy brigade on its own is a hostage, not a serious force able to fight or deter. The mere equipment is even less; since troops flown in would need time to mobilize that equipment, they'd likely be caught by any offensive before they could fight, while if they had more time to get ready they'd have time to take their own equipment too...The is a political message, not a serious military move for military purposes...The message is that we break another one of the promises that has so enraged Putin, pushing NATO into the post-Soviet space...Likely Putin will react. It is near certain. This can only make things worse. Is that the goal, do we want to make things worse? Seems so. Neocons stirring trouble, more of it.",Putin does not care that the whole world can tell that he's lying...Seems to be the standard these days.  Our drones kill not civilians?  Where were those WMDs anyway?

riclys,,,,"Washington's policy of isolating Putin has been a double-edged sword. As a self-designated exceptional hegemon, it will brook no challenge to its divine right to launch wars and impose regime change wherever it chooses. In fact, since Putin himself has  been deemed a thug it is not too much of a stretch that he too will become a target for regime change. The choice Washington faces is between engaging Russia on Syria diplomatically or engaging Russia on the battlefield directly as it defends Assad. To spurn Putin in New York could usher in a dangerous era of superpower conflict.","America's power is Putin's obsession. It would seem to be the other way around: has Russia ganged up with other nations to sanction the U.S.? Has Russia pressured other nations to debase the American dollar, and otherwise sought to strangle the American economy? Has Russia fomented, backed, and engineered a coup in Mexico or Canada and sought to train missiles on Washington with their cooperation? Did Russia lie to the U.S. and use a UN vote to destroy Libya? Does Russia continuously refer to President Obama as a thug? The U.S. has enjoyed global hegemony since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Now that that grip is receding largely due to militarism and corporate domination, bogeymen such as Putin and, increasingly, China's president, must be created to deflect attention from these twin domestic challenges.","How increase the cost? The premeditated attack on the ruble and draconian sanctions were not able to sway President Putin, why would doubling-down? The irony is that the EU is bearing the full cost, while the US gloats about its strengthening economy. President Putin has always been perfectly clear about his vision for eastern Ukraine. He has also been perfectly clear that he will not stand aside while Kiev bombards civilians. The onus is on Kiev and its western enablers to accept federalization now or partition later.","Europe cannot sustain the current sanctions regime against Russia indefinitely. Putin will never compromise Russian national security by acquiescing to AmericanNato moves in Ukraine and the Baltics, which abut Russian borders. Would the U.S. tolerate being targeted by strategic missiles in Canada and Mexico? As Russia consolidates economic ties with China a new strategic bi-polarity will develop: ChinaRussia v. U.S. Nato. While the West is engaged with stifling Muslim nationalism to protect corrupt regimes, the rest of the world forges ahead to embrace a new economic paradigm that will have its nexus in the Far East. No amount of self-righteous hand-wringing over Putin-this and Putin-that can stave off the fact that a new economic world order is at our doorstep.","The obsessive dislike for Mr. Putin by the NYT is in direct proportion to its frustration with the failure of the time-tested cudgels of sanctions and threats of war to pressure Mr. Putin to accede to US dictates. Russia is the only nation that has strategic parity with the US. Consequently, it must be constantly vilified and undermined, since it cannot be directly attacked. Ms. Nuland's famous epithet about the EU also applies to the rest of the world, and for the NYT is particularly applicable to Putin himself!","Would the US permit Mexico or Canada to become destabilized and violently overthrown by a pro-Russian bloc and turned into a base for Russian strategic weapons, or become part of an alliance against the US? Then why should we expect Russia to react any differently? This is geopolitics 101. The pushback from corporate interests in Europe and the US underlines the reality of interdependence. But Russia (and Putin )may discover that as the US empire continues to totter, it will opt for a series of pyrrhic victories rather than a sane policy of strategic multipolarity.  As it turns out, it is the West that has embraced the apocalypse.","Not considering a military response. Confirms the law that US-NATO is only eager to fight pushover adversaries rather than risking losses and the diminished prestige that will bring, a fact that Putin grasps intuitively. So now the West will engage in sanctions and covert measures to counter the Kremlin.But Putin has strategically entwined his economy with the EU so that any sanctions will have a boomerang effect. Iran never accomplished such integration and that left it open to unilateral sanctions. The question of Eastern Ukraine still looms, but its consequences are so volatile that one will expect diplomacy to settle it. Obama will rue the day he let neo-cons like Nuland, Power, and Rice (under the tutelage of Brezinski) drive his foreign policy.",How pleasant it is to wake up to another Putin bashing screed from the fair and balanced editorial board. Methinks they doth protest too much. The prospect of a China-Russia strategic alliance seems to be keeping them awake at night. It should.,"Putin has learned a dangerous lesson: Regain initiative lost in the dissolution of the Soviet Union, or lose Russian strategic capability. Fortunately with American depradations in the middle east, with a super power rampant ofter 911, Russia sees cover for security grabs of its own. The US will rue the day it cast aside all international norms, including the legitimacy of the United Nations, in pursuit of a monomaniacal goal to neutralize all adversaries or potential adversaries, and cement its global domination of a unipolar world. The rise of Putinism is in direct correlation to American unilateralism., thus the danger of shoulder to shoulder confrontation. The Security Council must be reconstituted, and and there must be a renewed commitment to peaceful negotiated settlement of disputes. The alternative, seemingly becoming inexorable, is too horrific to mention.","This article is completely unsubstantiated in its premises and is meant to simulate the intended effect of these US-engineered sanctions. The salient fact is that the US is petulantly instigating an animus against Putin and Russia because it is fearful and resentful of a Russia-China strategic alliance, because it will be the death-knell for US global dominance, which it has effectively enjoyed since the end of WW2. Germany is being ordered to be the sacrificial lamb in the gambit to weaken the Russian economy. But the world is turning. Look east! young man."

Full of references to past slights, obscured honor, and the promise of a powerful nationalist future.  It feels as though Russia is exiting it's post-war Weimar period into a dark future.","Thank you, NYT and, of course, readers and commentators! You've just opened my eyes on what western public is. By analyzing Putin's actions, you have already forgotten about the roots of the conflict in Ukraine. I think if you hadn't been looking at the civil war in Ukraine under a narrow angle, there would be less warmongers in top comments.","The West should be really careful with Putin now: he is cornered. On the one hand he promised Russians to gather back The Russian lands (whatever that means); tens of millions followed him emotionally, thousands went to fight in Ukraine, hundreds died. If he orders de-escalation, he will be seen as a traitor both  by people back at home in front of a TV, and especially by those who got guns from him,  put their lives in line and by now have a lot of guerilla experience.  On the other hand, it seems that the Russian Government at least hindered the investigation and at worse provided  technical and perhaps personal support for the terrorists who shot down the plane (according to the recording those who fired were in communication with the Russian Security Service). ..Historically, Putin had only one way to resolve a crisis: by increasing the bets. By escalating, he brings the confrontation to a new level, which, for a time, offers him more tactical space.","Last week Russia used a veto in the Security Council, sticking fingers in the global community's eyes instead of being responsible. This week according to this article, the President of Russia suggested examining possible steps the global community can take to help stabilize the situation, which he himself refuses to take. The President of Russia weekly steps back and forth, like a Bolshoi dancer. If Putin were a Republican, as he appears to act, Americans would call him a flip-flopper.  Americans have no idea how lucky they are to have President Obama, perfect for dealing with this flip-flopper, at this stage of history. Republicans have flip-flopped all over the place unpatriotically damaging United States better interests for years. If President Obama can deal with sad sack unpatriotic Republicans, who deserve no credit, perhaps he is better prepared to deal with sad sack inimical President Putin.","These developments were all predictable: after the West let Putin go with the Malaysian jet, Putin knows he can do whatever while the West will be at most concerned...(I think the reason being: the Americans are crippled by the memories of the Iraq adventure, while the Europeans want warm feet in winter and for that they seem to be ready to forget one hundred dead of their own.)","This is so chilling, reminiscent of the July crisis of 1914, and the diplomacy driven by mobilization. The tsar had the chance to implement partial mobilization of troops on its western border with Austria Hungary and Germany, but opted for full mobilization, prompting the Germans to respond in full. Can it be that on the centennial of the Great War, that we find ourselves on the brink of another European disaster, this time not over the Balkans but Ukraine? Merkel is right about Putin's old world approach to empire. We do not want Ukraine to turn into another Belarus, and we must avoid turning eastern Europe into the battleground that it has been for the past century.","Americans think that they are playing a chess game with Putin in Ukraine, and he is just outplaying them: what Russia has to gain from a civil war in Ukraine, right on its border, why Putin is fueling it? ..But the game is different:  it's not chess, it's a personal revenge. Just like with the girls who sang a song against him and got two years in prison, Ukrainians dared to defy him now two times in ten years. That's an unheard  disobedience, to be punishable by blood.",,
TT,,,,"It's sad, really -- there's so much potential in Russia if it could get rid of the petro-mafia economy it has now, stop jailing opposition leaders, reverse the complete state control of the media. Putin is turning Russia into North Korea bit by bit and when you think of how Russia could be a thriving, dynamic state it's such a tragic wasted opportunity.","The preference of the population in Eastern Ukraine doesn't matter, as it's being run by a collection of clownish upstarts, opportunists, and Moscow consultants. Pensioners don't have a say.

Oh right, they're on vacation.",Please. Putin blew any credibility he ever have had when he said There are no Russian soldiers in Crimea with a straight face.,"Putin is terrified of a Maidan in Moscow. He needs Ukraine to fail so that the same revolution doesn't happen in Russia. A corruption-free, prosperous Ukraine might make Russians think twice about the authoritarian kleptocracy they have now. There were already massive protests in 2012 -that's why he's closed down all the independent media, jailed protestors, put the main opposition leader under house arrest, and invaded Crimea, which has the dual benefit of destabilizing a fragile Ukraine and rallying support in Russia. As long as he had his puppet Yanukovich in place, Ukraine could be free, but now that Yanukovch is gone, Putin needs to make sure Ukraine is not successful. Ultimately, he wants to swallow Ukraine if possible, to create a Greater Russia. Bonus if a weak Europe lets him swallow the Baltic States as well - he's already make comments about protecting the Russian speakers in Estonia.","EU oversight is the point! The Ukrainians demonstrating want to join the EU for the rule of law and governance by institutions, not the awful corruption Ukraine has now. If they connect more deeply with Russia, it'll get even worse -- right now the press in Ukraine is much more free than in Russia, and the oligarchs are even more free. In Russia, the oligarchs are either loyal to Putin or in prison, like Khodorkovsky. So far, you can protest more or less freely in Ukraine, while in Russia there's much more intimidation and arrests of activists. ..And into whose pockets do you think that 15 billion is going to be funneled to? Yanukovych's dentist son is probably 1 on the list. His assets have gone from 7 million to 510 million in the last three years his father was president. Joining the EU is a start to fighting the corruption.",Funny how different Putin's opinions on separatism were when Chechnya wanted to leave Russia.,,,,
doug mclaren,,,,"Putin's plan is to box us into a position where we end up subsidizing his land grab. Right now he is holding a big chunk of the Ukraine hostage, with the expectation that we will a) agree to the Crimean acquisition, b) allow eastern Ukraine to split off under the guise of federalism and c) that the west will send enough aid cash to the Ukraine to allow him and his cronies to siphon off enough to end up with a net profit. In essence, buying Crimea and Eastern Ukraine with our money, not his.","The view from the East of Russia's actions and motivations is that there is once again a good possibility of Moscow being restored to its historical status as a vassal state of Beijing. Russia has reinforced its reputation as an unreliable partner, but as a subject and client state, may be appealing. Compared to China, Russia's economy is struggling, its demographics collapsing, brains and cash are escaping to the west and its military, though effective as suppressing internal groups and poorly trained and equipped neighbors, is hardly a match for NATA and US. Russia does exceed China on a few counts though, energy resources and high level corruption to name a couple. Putin turning east to beg for loans should make Mao smile in his tomb.","The western response should be to sharply raise the cost to Putin for his having violated treaties and assurances so as to set the stage for his successor to normalize relations with the west. There are a number of simple yet severe steps that can be taken. For example, suspending Russian access to SWIFT bank transactions, suspending commercial flights in and out of Russia, suspending visa issuance more broadly. Also, as a show of solidarity with European energy security needs the administration could approve the Keystone pipeline and other measures that increase the supply of energy to the EU and our other allies. Being more accommodating to Chinese interests will also be necessary, since without strong economic and trade support from China, Putin's new Russia economy has nowhere to go but down.","Of coarse Russia will rebound, like any dead cat will bounce if dropped from a high enough platform. The choice for Russia is when and how to ease Mr. Putin into retirement, so that the nation can achieve a sustainable upward trajectory (economically and socially), or whether to allow him to persist with his misguided attempt to pursue the Russian myth of being the dominant power of Eurasia, which will only lead to being restored as a vassal state of China.",Cuban voting with their feet on Mr. Putin's credibility?,the red sky's of the sunset of Mr. Putin's regime are scary indeed to the rest of Europe. Can he see himself that he overplayed his hand and stained in legacy?,"So it seems like Putin is on the verge of launching a lose by winning strategy. If he moves deeper into Ukraine, what does he get? A collapsing client economy, civil war (or something like it), trade restrictions, loss of foreign investment in Russia itself, capital flight, etc. All this without the US and EU having to do anything at all. A replay of their failed Afghan adventure but on an even grander scale. This would set back Russia a decade or more from their current modest recovery, pretty much wiping out all the advances that Mr. Putin would like to take credit for. Since Mr Putin and his administration are not that stupid it seems more likely that their strategy is to scare the opposition into compliance, allowing a more Russia oriented successor to be appointed. As much as Mr. Putin doesn't want to lose Ukraine, neither does he want to own it.","The US really doesn't have to do much at this point in time. Russia is in a damage control mode now, trying to figure out how to make a bad situation from becoming much much worse. Putin's international reputation is severely stained, and the unnecessary financial risk they have exposed themselves to in their ill-planned land grab is growing exponentially day by day. The US can afford to let them twist in the wind while the EU fulminates and facilitates. The best action for Russia would be to arrest Yanukovich for corruption and embezzlement and them keep him in Russia under protective custody indefinitely, and then let the dysfunctional Ukrainian parliament plan the next election.","I would like to learn more about Putin's relatives and children. Are they being lined up for future positions of power? Will we see Putin mimicking the strategy of the Kim family of North Korea, establishing himself as the founder of a hereditary leadership clan while the best brains and money escape the country as it descends into becoming another nuclear armed 3rd world economy?","So it seems like Putin is on the verge of launching a lose by winning strategy.

Andrew,,,,"Easy for you to say since you do not sit on a border with Russian; since Putin has been in power he has attacked Georgia (not a state of the US), the Ukraine, and the Baltins and took land from all. It is very easy for you to sit back to rationalize his behavior but to live there is a different matter.","It's a nice thought. But in practice, breaking up countries and redrawing boundaries has resulted in far more war and carnage than the reverse. ..The reality is that virtually all boundaries are arbitrary. People don't live in neat patterns. Any border will leave minority communities and enclaves on other sides. Most of the world's countries are therefore multiethnic. And trying to redraw boundaries to conform to these groups is likely to result in greater discrimination, ethnic cleansing, and civil war. ..Historically, when boundaries have been redrawn, the results have conformed to this  war, ethnic cleansing, dictatorship. Austria-Hungary, Yugoslavia, India and Pakistan, and N. Ireland are the relevant examples. I would actually put the breakup of the USSR in the same category, as it resulted in lots of frozen conflicts and wars in many of the successor states. (Though I oppose Putin's actions here, I do think it would have been best if Gorbachev's plan for a new union had gone through.) Czechoslovakia is an very unique case (where, ironically, there was no great demand for a breakup among the public  maybe that's why it was peaceful). ..But whatever the circumstances of its birth, Ukraine has been independent now for over 20 years. Redrawing its boundaries now would only make the situation worse. Yugoslavia is the relevant example, not Czechoslovakia.","Putin's primary source of revenue is fossil fuel and his belligerence, aside from playing to nationalism in a faltering economy, is also designed to raise the price of oil and natural gas. Arms sales are also a source of revenue so it is no surprise that his provocative move to sell Iran a missile defense system. He has to keep NATO at bay and paint the US as a provocateur for support of the Russian people..There is nothing new about his orders for jet interceptors to shadow US surveillance aircraft in international airspace, but the elevated level of such incidents goes beyond testing its capabilities and is likely to lead to fatal incidents as Russian pilots execute dangerously close maneuvers. The downing of the Malaysian passenger plane over Ukraine may have been a terrible error on the part of untrained missile operators, but Putin's failure to assign accountability is unsurprising. He obviously must be unequivocally constrained as he tests the US and European resolve, probably with much more severe financial sanctions that prohibit his cronies from transferring funds, for example.","After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the fact that Ukraine was not going to be able to join NATO as a full member, Ukraine probably should have declared itself neutral and become the Switzerland of Eastern Europe.  It might have bought their leaders some time to figure out which direction they wanted to take the country.  If Ukraine had joined NATO, Putin would never have dared annex the Crimea; a look back at his adventures over the past 8 years shows that he is only reclaiming land in countries that have a formal, but weak, agreement with NATO.  Ironic that Russia has one too called Partnership for Peace.",Big coverup operation Putin,"In 1997, just as I was leaving Kazakstan after 3 years of work and travel, the Kazak government decided to move its capitol north several hundred kilometers from Almaty to what was then Akmola (now Astana).  It seemed like a strange thing to do but local acquaintances were fairly certain that it was the Kazak government's fear of Russian expansion (like the Ukraine, the population centers of northern Kazakstan are majority Russian)...The Kazak leaders simply had taken note of what had become a frequent, very cynical theme in Russian policy towards it's near abroad (Moldova, Ossetia, etc).  Use protection of Russian populations as an excuse to wage proxy wars and so gain influence and leverage in those territories.  One needs to understand that in the true corridors of power in the Russian government, it is still the old regime, Putin's old KGB friends, who dictate foreign policy.  ..What we are seeing in the Ukraine is simply what has been going on for more than a decade now in the territories of the former Soviet Union.  Russia uses whatever leverage it has to manipulate and bully countries that it still sees as its own.   When Russia was annoyed at Kazakstan, back in the day, one could be assured that there would be blackouts in the northern cities (energy was exported out of Kazakstan and then brought back in from electricenergy stations located in Russia).","I do agree with the notion of letting Ukraine solve this by themselves, the problem is its war spilling into all of Europe that worries people. Plus Putin's got aspbuergers.","Precisely. It's fair and proper to recognize when the US has been in the wrong. But the logical response isn't to then acquiesce to Russian violations of international law. US wrong  Russia right is just as hypocritical as US right  Russia wrong. The proper response is to condemn both. ..And for that matter, I find it odd that so many people are reducing this to a simple US vs. Russia question. Putin's actions in Crimea have drawn universal condemnation; virtually the only country that has expressed support for Russia is Syria. If US hypocrisy is what animates people here, then there are plenty of countries  Sweden, for example  condemning this whose hands are clean over both Iraq and Russia's invasion.","This is exactly the point. I'm a card-carrying lefty and Iraq war opponent, and while I understand skepticism towards US foreign policy and military adventurism, this doesn't justify a Russian landgrab. The reason Russia's actions are drawing universal condemnation  not just from the US  is because the notion that a country can just invade and annex neighboring territory is a dangerous one, and likely to lead to far more war, not less. That's the reason these actions are banned by the UN charter and typically recognized as illegal under international law. That the US has also violated international law at times doesn't justify Russia; the proper response is to condemn both. ..Now, for all practical purposes, it isn't likely the rest of the world can do much to prevent Putin from annexing Crimea. But sanctions are entirely appropriate, both to discourage other countries from attempting the same thing and to discourage Russia from trying to grab more of Eastern and Southern Ukraine.","It is crazy to ask people why are we supposed to hate Putin. Have you ever been in Russia? I have lived all my life here. And don't belive to your media, they will always blame Putin. The majority of people are for Putin and respect him for what he has done for the country. You are all manipulated by your media and your politicians. Open your eyes."

sandy,,,,"The Ukraine is vital to Russia for many reasons, not the least that it was part of Russia for many years and Russians have shed a great deal of blood and treasure on it. The last thing Russia or Putin wants is to see the country dismembered by the US and EU like Yugoslavia not so long ago..This would appear to be part of diplomatic efforts by Russia to find a negotiated solution. If such a solution is not found there is the Russian army. No amount of sanctions is going to deter Russia from securing a stable Ukraine that is not part of NATO. And justifiably so.","Putin's demands for military de-escalation and national dialogue requiring EU and US pressure on the hot shots in Kiev seems like a reasonable way to try resolve the crisis with minimum bloodshed. A crisis created by the US and EU..What the hell Obama and his team are doing poking the beehive in Ukraine in the first place is a mystery, to me at least. It is probably about the US trying to get some geopolitical advantage but the risks are high for both the US and a lot of Ukrainians. Russia can retaliate to the criticisms and sanctions by shutting off NATO access to Afghanistan followed by trading on a large scale with Iran which will effective nullify western sanctions, followed by turning jihadis loose on the Saudis, Qataris and other supporters of the jihadists fighting in Syria! And those could be just for starters!.I wish the NYT would also provide coverage from a different perspective - a more factual and realistic perspective perhaps, like Seamus Milne's piece in The Guardian. Even if its against our governments policies.","Ever since Russia broke off Ukraine from its own territory and gave it independence, the US has been trying to destabilize it and turn it into a US and EU ally and install NATO on the border of Russia. It is interesting to see what Russian resistance to this plan - which was to be expected - is now causing among the major EU members and the US..The rebels in the East still mainly using captured Ukrainian military equipment but with some Russian hardware as well, have regrouped and retrained and are now taking the fight to the Ukrainian military and their mercenary militias - who seem to be getting paid by US humanitarian funds! This has caused consternation among German, French and US leadership. So Biden is off jetting around in Europe, and Kerry is brow beating Poroshenko and taking a suitcase full of money to pay the Ukrainian mercenary forces, while Merkel and Hollande are off to brace the evil dragon Putin in his lair!!.The US has needlessly created this dangerous situation and Russia is not going to back down.","This article is a lot of sound and fury and signifies nothing to paraphrase old Willie. In the Western media it is always Putin should do this and Putin should do that. Articles are never about the suspect people who overthrew an elected government in Kiev with the considerable assistance of the US and EU. These guys fire bombed unarmed cops and more recently a bunch of civilians in Odessa. Their predecessors fought with the German army and SS for Pete's sake..Articles never seem to describe why so many senior US and EU government officials including Joe Biden and the CIA chief keep traveling back and forth to Kiev carrying checks for millions of dollars.

Perhaps Putin could then knock some sense into Poroshenko and his fascist henchmen and more people are not needlessly killed.","It is hard to believe anything that is stated or provided as evidence, by the current Kiev regime and their supporters. They cater to the western narrative of blaming everything on Russia and the terrible Putin - no matter what!.Evidence is easily doctored as the NYT well knows, but they are very upright and honorable men in Kiev who would not dream of doing such a thing!","It appears that the US with EU help is prepared to destroy Ukraine in the process of getting its way.

Putin's Russia is trying to preserve the state and its people..Ukraine has been part of Russia far longer than it has been an independent state and instead of constantly demonizing Mr. Putin, for a change the NYT and others in the western media could perhaps try to look at the situation from his point of view.","This seems like a petulant reaction by the US and its NATO partners, the G7, to the thwarting of their clever little plan for Ukraine by Russia and its President, the G8th. How dare Putin try to stop us from the wealth of the Donbas and parking our warships in Sevastopol?.You are therefore not invited to our next party and we will not give you your little piece of cake!.The awful reality is that this setback is not likely to deter the US led G7 on their plans for Ukrainian and Russian wealth and Russia's troublesome will and  power. The constant accusations of Russian escalation would seem to mask and perhaps justify exactly such escalations by members of the G7..This could lead to awful consequences..One hopes that the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize would finally do something to deserve it. But that takes wisdom and courage.","The US and its EU allies have very dirty hands in the instigation of the present conflict in Ukraine, and are understandably reluctant to directly confront Putin's response to their machinations as that could lead to war. So it is wise to be circumspect in their choice of words..The wisest course of action for the US and EU is to let Moscow and Kiev work things out without US or EU interference of any kind. Unfortunately, that would require some decency and thoughtfulness on the part of our leaders, which seems to be in short supply.","The US and EU have often used humanitarian assistance as an excuse for military intervention in many parts of the World over the past 20 to 30 years. In fact the bombing campaign and weapons deliveries in Iraq provide a current example..It is possible that Ukrainian government interdiction of these food stuffs and medical supplies may trigger a Russian military intervention. Western governments and media will react with mock horror, threats and additional sanctions, while being nothing more than sanctimonious hypocrites!.Unfortunately, Ukraine has been targeted as an anti-Russian bastion by the US and its EU allies. A state where NATO and the European Union will be on Russia's very doorstep. Russia has spent a great deal of blood and treasure over the years in liberating Ukraine from both German and Ukrainian Nazis. The area has been part of Russia for hundreds of years and many Russians live there. Putin and Russia have so far exercised a great deal of restraint. Perhaps its time for us in the US to do the same."

Since the USA depends upon Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States for much of its oil imports, while Americans continue to burn imported oil, Saudi Arabia and its vassals along the Persian Gulf will dictate US policy in the Levant...The Saudi Royal family being in bed with the Wahhabis, even though most of the Saudi princes just want to party, the Shiites of Iran, Mesopotamia and Syria are its historical foes. Saudi Arabia wants Assad gone not because he is a brutal dictator but because he is an Alawite, and, crudely speaking, the Alawites are an offshoot of the Twelver Shiites...Russia competes with Saudi Arabia as a global oil exporter, eg to China. The Russian Orthodox Church has always been implacably opposed to Sunni Islam in all its variants. Putin is prepared to do deals with the Shiites of Iran, Mesopotamia and Syria if it gives him an advantage in the Great Game of Chess that the Russian Federation skilfully plays with the Sunni Saudis and their vassals.","In fact, on the world stage, Russians per se have never been particularly good at chess. This is another myth about the Motherland that Russian nationalists like to try to propagate. The last time Moscow was able to crow about communism creating chess-masters was during the heady days of the Soviet Union in the 50s. ..Even then, however, Boris Spassky was a product of the relative liberal, Europeanised culture of Saint Petersburg (at the time renamed Leningrad), in Finnic Ingria, a far cry from the grim, imperial impulses of the Kremlin. As soon as he could, Spassky sensibly decamped to France. Tigran Petrosian was born to Armenian parents in Tiflis, Georgia. David Bronstein was born in Bila Tserkva, Ukraine, to Jewish parents. Moreover, the great Garry Kasparov was born in Baku Azerbaijan to a Jewish father and an Armenian mother...Putin is old-school KGB. He is a master of the mask, of the bluff, the huff and the puff. Too many Americans and too many Europeans these days scare too easily. Put Putin and all the scaredy-cats together, and the bully on the block can run riot.","Why is chess the Russian national game? Because it appeals to the Russian mentality. Chess is a game of subterfuge. The great players seem to be following a classic defence or attack, then, while the old hands are sagely nodding their heads, suddenly take their opponents and the watchers by surprise by introducing a variation never seen before. Sambo and judo, played the Russian way, are physical variations of chess just as judo, played the Japanese way, is a physical variation of go. Physicality and physiology loom large, off course, in judo and sambo, but the all-important element of successful attack is the element of surprise, just as in chess...Putin is not Yeltsin, nor Brezhnev nor even Khrushchev. Putin fancies himself as the master tactician and strategist just as did Stalin. Putin is a self-disciplined teetotaller who dreams of restoring the glory days of the Russian Empire. The USA's disreputable and sordid incursions into South America, the Near East and Far East, have been always to protect the interests of US businesses and lazy Americans who love their cars. Putin cares nothing for Russian business or for the comfort of the Russian citizenry because he doesn't need to worry about votes in the way that elected politician in a populist democracy like the USA need to worry...Putin dreams about the past - nothing else. To understand a man like Putin, you must read the biographies of Alexander, of Caesar, of Genghis Khan, of Napoleon, and of Hitler and Stalin.","Frankly, I'm shocked. Where have all Putin's pets gone? By this time they should all be out in force, clamouring on this forum. Are they all asleep at the helm?","The best analysis I've read of Putin the person and statesman is by Yevgenia Albats:..'The mentality of the KGB officer is such that they were taught to be an extreme statist. In Russian language it is derzhavnik--by saying derzhavnik, we mean those who believe in the Russian greatness, in the Russian imperialistic notion of being a great empire. That's the kind of mentality that was taught and developed inside the KGB. And we clearly can see that Putin is that sort of extreme statist. For him, as for many of those who worked in the KGB, the state always goes first.' 1..1) <a hrefhttp:www.pbs.orgwgbhpagesfrontlineshowsyeltsinputinputin.html titlehttp:www.pbs.orgwgbhpagesfrontlineshowsyeltsinputinputin.html targetblank>http:www.pbs.orgwgbhpagesfrontlineshowsyeltsinputinputin.html<a>","We need to stop turning a blind eye to the culpability of each of the individual butchers who follow orders. The Nuremberg Trials established once and for all that that does not excuse crimes against humanity...We have to understand that, mid-way through their crash course in Buk Basics 101, the band of Don Cossack irregulars who pushed the buttons were likely drunk, and using Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 as target practise to try out their newfound skills. Commercial airliner with hundreds of innocents aboard? In the world of gangsters, who cares? The Don Cossacks are proud of their bandit heritage and their indifference to the taking of human life...Putin is behind this, no doubt. Nevertheless, without the thugs who gladly follow him, who delight in the opportunities for banditry offered by the Prince of Thieves, there would have been no missile launched. Even Putin can't operate a Buk missile launcher single-handed.","Putin's popularity rating could be 8 rather than 80 - it would make no difference. What do you think Stalin's rating was? Or Brezhnev's? The only radical regime changes in Muscovy happen at the end of a gun barrel, backed up by the hangman's noose and the gulag. ..The descendants of bandits will only ever be interested in further banditry. And the bandit leader stays in charge until he dies, or he is too old and infirm to stave off the challenges of the strongest of the young pretenders...There is no point in trying to appeal to Putins good side because just like Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev he doesnt have one. You can take the boy out of the KGB but you cant take the KGB out of the boy. Might, not right, is the only thing that gangsters like Putin and his pals understand.","Clark, If you were interested enough in my point of view to follow my many posts over the years on the NYT, then you would see that most of them are critical of the Land of the Free and it's allies. But yes, it's true that compared to the likes of the PRC, North Korea and the Russian Federation, the USA for all it's many faults remains a beacon of light. It's a shame that you and Putin's other apologists fail to see how evil Putin and his henchmen are, just as previous apologists for the Soviet Union failed to acknowledge the evil of Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev.","We get the oligarchs we deserve. The USA's spineless and apathetic citizenry can't be bothered to turn out to the federal polls and vote. You Yanks deserve the Koch brothers, the GOP and the Tea Party, just as you deserved Vietnam. You all wave your flags and trumpet about being the world's greatest democracy, but come election time, most of you are too bone idle even to trundle down to an election booth and cast your vote. We reap what we sow...The Russian Empire is completely different to the USA. Comparing Putin to Obama, or to Bush, or even to Nixon is ridiculous. This shows how clueless even self-regarding NYT 'liberals' are about their own country's recent history let alone the long history of an empire as complex as Muscovys...Putin is a fascist dictator, a ruthless KGB apparatchik, who makes King George, the last unelected tyrant to rule the Land of the Free, seem like Mary Poppins...The USA is a spoiled-brat democracy flawed by the laziness, wilful ignorance and self-indulgence of its apathetic citizenry who wont press for real political change because theyre glued to their idiot boxes watching oafs throw a leather ball, or competing for some tawdry title as the Most Mediocre Yowling Talent of the Year...The Russian Empire is not a democracy. It never has been and it never will. The empire ruled by Prince Putin of Muscovy is a despotism - and there is nothing that the Russian citizenry will ever be able to do about it in the lifetime of anyone commenting here."
Olga,,,,You probably see it more clearly from NYC.  But my relatives in Crimea who have a child from Donbass in their family since spring and who go on with their normal lives are 100 happy to be with Russia AGAIN and pray for Putin's health everyday.  Sorry to disillusion you.,some comments:.1) not all people have right to vote (only people who're 18).2) there were two varions - join Russia or stay in Ukraine with autonomy status.3) even forces in Kiev have Russian wepons... but  it does not mean Russians invaded Kiev....4) do you really check it? It is as true as Putin is going to annex all East Europe.5) these people were legally elected in 2010. and so on...,"If Russia will not send humanitarian aid to eastern Ukraine, then who will? USA, EC? Next to nothing is still done from other countries. And now the stream of refugees is taking to Russia. For you to assess what is happening on another continent is much easier than people who see it on the next door and have relatives in Ukraine. Why Putin can not protect the Russian-speaking population in the east of Ukraine and provide them with humanitarian aid? In this case, America has begun to apply point bombing of Iraq only because Mr. Obama protects American diplomats there? But it also can be described in one word - oil! Ukrainian nationalism is prospering and people shouting slogans  Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heros!! and honor memory of Mr. Stepan Bandera. I kindly ask you read and remember history of the Second World War, especially Volhynia (Volyn) massacre, and you will understand what is happening in the Ukraine with Russian-speaking population there.",,,,,,,
Ross,,,,"Yes Putin won in Chechnya by simply using Special Forces and as best as possible only fight the extremists and gave those who did not want to fight a safe place to sit out the campaign. He knew that was the only way not to lose the war. You must come out of it with most people on your side. Win the hearts and minds of most of the people. The Yeltsin way using extensive Air Power and Artillery Firepower proved completely counter productive. He then consolidated position by putting in control the most popular Leader in Chechnya. Not the ideal leader but the best of a bad lot..Typical Putin. Pragmatic, reasoned and logical. Never an idealist. Simply a realist.","You are peace make man....I wish the Putin's regime falls to the hands of freedom fighters of Russia, as it happened i Ukraine, we would have much less problems in Europe for us Europeans.... The  Russia is a great country in every meaning (tyranny is a part of it unfortunately). Imagine Russia as a democratic state in cooperation with Europe and US...","Putin should admit of wrong doing by his predecessor (at least soviets) and his own wrong decisions and stop his moves on destabilizing of the situation in the region, by helping Ukraine preserve its unity. Otherwise it will turn to gorillas wars and actions, as violent response to aggression addressed to any nation.","The nazis are history now. You and people like you, including Russian media, playing with a fire. And it looks, that this is the thing that Putin exactly needs, to start invasion.  I wouldn't count ukrainias, who cooperated with nazi (they are shame on the body of my nation), for just this reason: Vlasov's 100,000 soldiers insurgent army under direct commandment of nazis in Russia, is way bigger fake reason to blame Russian Nation in being nazis.","Nowadays Russian army is not the soviet army, it as corrupted as is government, in case if they invade Ukraine, will face heavy losses, a specially a the western part of the country. Defenders always have advantage over invader, this is the simple rule of war school.  And as corrupted army, it'll get demoralized quickly.  I would not rule disorganized and demoralized troops on foreign land. Guess what? China right the way will get to Russian Far East. Putin will though himself in to deadly trap, facing Yanukovich's fate...","Listen @dontbelieve, should Obama address whatever he wants to be issued  to US Nation in Spanish, or German Canceler in Turkish or Putin in Ukrainian (Ukrainian diaspora in Russia is over 1,5 million) etc.. and so on....Come on... take a break","I agree with CDC's post, who is the NYT's Pick 1. But first, Ukrainians have to have Yanukovych handcuffed and brought to justice and it should be done in the international court, so So, Putin have no chance to blame Ukrainians in being fascists..Second, once Yanukovich on trial in the International Court, Putin loses one more trump, that could be used  in Putin's try to extinguish the fire of democratic changes, that gets so close to Russian border. The Russian naval base in Crimea,  is the fire department for this kind of occasions..Open your eyes, especially Europeans, you might get call on you to one of those Russian  fire department.","Take your hands off Ukraine Putin, and let as live as normal Europeans... We have enough of soviets, NKVD and Putin's KGB, Go back to your Siberia, where your Putin-like KGBists have killed millions of Ukrainians, Take your hands of Ukraine, if Russians in Crimea want to live with Russia, they should take their bags, and go with you and be happy there... Ukrainians are Europeans, if someone doesn't like it, then, should keep it to himself..Don't call yourself our brothers after killing our people and when we fight back, labeling us nazis and whatever else..And about Yanukovich's legitimacy as president..He is the criminal with two heavy criminal charges (armed robbery and rape)... This person is not the president... Criminal should be in  right place - PRISON..If Russian people consider themself as true neighbors of Ukraine, then find the way to explain to Putin, to stand back, before Russian mothers will start lose their sons on the foreign land..","I hope that Russian people can read this....We have no problems with Russians, ordinary Russians....And they should know, before it gets too late. No mother wants her son to die on foreign ground Do your job people, make Putin stop, so, your sons will not die in Ukraine, defending Putin's KGB vision of order, outside of Russia..We stood up and fought for our freedom, and if Putin wants it back, he'll pay the highest price, that we can get of him. Stop call my country someone's backyard, if some of other countries are don't want to help us, go watch your TV show and series, and stop posting things like ...Ukraine is Russian backyard, its a Russian sphere of influence... Our lives are not your movie... We are real and struggling to get out of this disaster that we have, thanks to people like Putin and Yanukovich.","Putin does not see Crimea as part of Russia.. The Russians, who live there are acting  as fools. Maximum that Putin need is to get for Crimea independence, so he can keep going with his naval base there much easier than it would be going with current Ukrainian government. That is way, Yanukovich is in Russia. Putin will handle  him over to Ukraine with stolen 70B, as soon as Ukraine have referendum ready..The Crimea itself is the disaster zone for Ukraine as well as for Russia, otherwise it wouldn't be gifted to Ukraine, back in soviet union, nobody gives away something valuable....And if Ukraine gets this 70B back, along with dear Yanukovich, fixes its economy collapse,  within 4-5 years, Crimean Russian will turn to Ukrainians, in order to get out of destroyed independent Crimea"
Ned Kelly,,,,"At this point, just admit that Putin's buddies have got as much right to the eastern Ukraine as NATO has to expand into western Ukraine, and let's get back to the drawing board. This is small potatoes compared to what's been brewing south of the Black Sea.","Obama prepares to add pressure on Putin? Given how the pressure on Putin not to support Assad is turning out in IsisLand, Vladimir should have the last laugh this time around as well.","Hmmm, Isis BAD, Islamic Fundamentalism BAD, Assad against Islamic Fundamentalism, Putin friend of Assad. Iraq unraveling so quickly that Assad doesn't appear so bad as he used to. President Obama, perhaps it's time to reconsider those sanctions altogether.","Not so much a question of Putin winning as the continued reprecussions of a losing NeoCon foreign policy implemented on March 20, 2003 which destabilised Iraq and led to the creation of ISIS.",,,,,,
Herman Ross,,,,"Bill B -..Ukraine's new government was hostile toward Russia from the outside. Kiev was also under the influence of US and EU advisers. Given the US vs. Russia rivalry, it's naive to assume that Russia should not have felt vulnerable about the issue of Sevastopol. Putin's actions in Crimea were entirely rational given the circumstances...My point about east Ukraine is that much of it has always been, in many ways, more closely bound to Russian than to west Ukraine. That's especially true economically, culturally and linguistically. Ukrainians are the majority in east Ukraine, but historically, they are the region's immigrant culture. Ukrainians merged with the preexisting dominant Russian presence. Russians are not an alien culture in east Ukraine. ..Finally, it's folly to assume that the population of Crimea doesn't favor the union with Russia. Overwhelmingly Crimea's population is Russian.",The latest Minsk Accords will not secure peace in Ukraine any more than the 1973 Paris Accords settled the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese had no intention of resting until the last American helicopter had been cleared from Saigon. Putin will not stop until American political and military influence has been swept from Ukraine...Let's face the truth. American has overreached in its efforts to secure world hegemony. Again.,,,,,,,,
al,,,,Do we need an obscure Russian newspaper to know that?..The takeover of Crimea was a well-planned and executed military operation. Ukranian bases and fleet were overrun in a matter of few days by an overwhelming troop contingent wearing no insignia...and Putin expressed gratitude to his troops for a well-conducted operation. And he first denied (as in lied) then admitted to Russian military involvement in the takeover...Why are political talking heads so aversive of common sense and truth?,"In all this one thing is a total mystery..What exactly is Merkel's diplomatic 'solution.?' So far Europe has shown no leverage whatsoever over Putin, while he palyed it and Ukraine for a sucker...Russia is openly and with a great confidence bullies Ukraine. The only way to deal with a bully is to make him wary of the cost he will incur...What cost does Merkel believe Europe can exact on Russia that will make Putin change his course? He's shrugged the sanctions off without blinking...The only leverage here I can think of is an absolute political and economic blockade, and if that doesn't work - a massive military aid to Ukraine. I doubt Russia has the stomach for an all out war with Ukraine with millions of deaths on both sides.","Huh, Bob, got knowledge?..The Russian troops weren't visible in Crimea either, yet Putin thanked them for a well-conducted operation. Look up the photo of a T72-B tank in Donetsk (BBC) that Ukranian army doe not have. While at it also explain, where the 'rebels' get their artillery (mortars and rockets) for a sustained year-long shelling and counter-attack against a regular army. Also please explain how a civilian population of about 5mln has in a few months raised and steadily grown over a year a highly professional fighting force of more than 10 thousands (almost 1 of the total population)?","It's time Ukraine (the Western part wanting independence from Russia) grew a gut. I know it's a clich nut a true one, freedom isn't free...If Ukraine wants freedom it's time they called Putin's bluff. Yes, Russia can intervene militarily, but if Ukraine makes the price high enough - in 10K's of casualties, Putin will blink. The mysterious Russian soul has its mystery only on the domestic market - A Kremlin midget (from Lenin down) flexes his muscles, and the rest of the country get off. The rest of the world can see it through...However, any weakness toward Putin and his spec forces in E. Ukraine will bring only humiliation and a downfall of Ukrainian independence. Ukraine is a good size country of 40 mln with about 30mln with strong anti-Russian sentiment, who could withstand a Russian assault, if they are ready to pay a heavy price for freedom...When casualties start mounting in thousands, Putin will find himself completely isolated to the tune of Assad, and he doesn't want it and will back down. Go Ukraine and the West, the Russian bear won't dare.","This is from the Minsk agreement signed by Putin, Merkel, Holland, and Poroshenko:..Withdrawal of all foreign troops and weapons from Ukrainian territory. Disarmament of all illegal groups...Since Putin signed it, it means he acknowledged the presence of foreign troops and weapons in Ukraine. Since Putin has never claimed a presence of any Western troops and weapons, the only ones he could agree to withdraw are Russian...What more evidence do we need of Putin and Russian lies?","The mental contortions of Putin's apologists get stranger and stranger...Putin with Poroshenko, Merkel, and Hollande signed (as in ink) an agreement calling for withdrawal of all foreign troops and weapons from E. Ukraine...What foreign troops and weapons Putin agreed needed to be withdrawn? French? German?..We've all known Puitn for a little liar he is, but what about the rest of the world calling spade a spade?","You can't guarantee territorial integrity if the people in the territory have other ideas...Yes we can, Judy. The Russians did in Chechnya very well - it's still part of Russia and can't wiggle an inch, Putin is looking into it as hard as he is into Ukraine.","If anyone had doubts that Putin had restored the Soviet cold war anti-Western politics, substituting an orthodox nationalism for the atheist communism, those doubts are no more. He uses an exact copy of the Soviet 'black is white' rhetorics. Here's from the horse's mouth:..The West wants the bear to sit around eating honey and berries, not chasing around the forest after piglets... By piglets he, no doubt, means Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova. So, in his mind, interfering with Rusisan aggression means restraining the bear...regaining Crimea should not be thought of as punishment but as the price that had to be paid to defend Russias sovereignty. Annexing another country's land is defending Russia's sovereignty. The next step is to defend its sovereignty in the Balts, Finland (used to be part of Russia), Alaska, and maybe (if ruble holds fast) California (there's Russian river in Sonoma valley)...For Russians this economic crisis is NOT a problem, they'll pull through, they have no choice. The choice they face, though, is what kind of a nation they want to be. An isolated N. Korea type, contributing nothing to humanity but petty theft and destruction, or an integrated to the world's community society, looking into the future...To detractors. Before you start with your, look what the US has contributed to the world, see what the US (and the West in large starting with the old civilizations of Greece and Rome) has indeed contributed to the world, both good and bad.","A better policy would be to call Russia's bluff, let them have Ukraine but at a great cost - an all out cold war with a complete cessation of all cooperation...In the long run, after Putin's gone (in 30-40 years), Russia will come back asking to let her in. Then make them pay the bill.","To answer the author's query - Putin doesn't respect us, because we respect Putin...The reset charade was both humiliating and dumb, much dumber than the lamented by Friedman NATO expansion. NATO expansion ensured irreversibility of emancipation of western USSR...It's time the West came to its senses and deployed its soft power - increasing political and economic isolation of Putin (G7 is a better number), without picking up a fight slowly wrestling Ukraine from his claws (leave him Crimea but never recognize the legality of it, keep it as a pawn in the geo-political struggle), slowly but steadily increase NATO's power at Russia's border...In short, ignore Putin as much as possible, while clipping his claws inch by inch...Of course, it's time Europe started pulling its weight. Common guys, wake up already, the bear's paw is elbow deep in your honey."
Maria,,,,"Where are the voices of the GOP 'Putin's a real man'  contingent?  Still smitten?.The 108 AIDS researchers and staffers, some of them world leaders in their field, all of them having made healing and relief of  suffering their life's work, were killed and are now being disgracefully dishonored by Putin's Russian-trained thugs..Those AIDS workers  were shining examples of what 'real men' and 'real women' are.","It's obvious Putin want to restore the old Soviet Union with himself at the helm.  He will continue expanding Russia's borders if left unchecked. I wish everybody would be tired of wars, death, suffering and devastation by now. Russia and Ukraine have suffered so much and only madness and blind ambition can explain Putin's actions..Crimea is a new addition to Ukraine (a gift from Krushev in 1954). Negotiate a deal: use of ports for 100 years for cash badly needed. Or, as someone already said, offer to buy it outright..Putin is just showing the world what a fool he is.",,,,,,,,
NYer,,,,Mr. Putin was complicit in shooting down a civilian airliner over Ukraine.  He openly provided heavy lethal weaponry to be used against a largely civilian population.  You do not analyze a mad man's thinking.  You either stop him or you get out of his way.,"There may be relief and giggles that the mad bear Putin has had his military belligerence rewarded with economic deprivation.  So now the mad bear is also wounded, hungry and angry.  The cold rationality of the marketplace may not prevail over ambition and arrogance.  In Russia, the falling Ruble may lead to falling bombs before it leads to falling leaders.","The Russian people rallied behind their leader Putin when the strong man  bullied the Ukrainians.  That was nice for them remembering their domination as the Soviet Union and the hope Putin would once again conquer and reinvent Russia as arguably the worlds dominant superpower.  But that lasted for a day and as always brutal military arrogance is drowned in economic reality.   If there was ever anyone playing the 'short game', this is it.  The thoughtful, reflective Chinese, masters of the 'long game', must be seriously considering the blunders they have seen Putin make and will certainly think twice about wishing to form any serious alliance with Russia.  If wiser heads do not prevail in Russia than political and economic isolation is inevitable.","What Mr. Putin is actually saying is that the difference between invasion and heroic protection of an endangered population is completely pretext.  Theater, well staged.","If nothing else, it would appear that this cowardly bullying by Mr. Putin has finally lit a fire under the EU and US.  I do not expect the west to cower any longer when Putin objects to missile shields, equipment and western troops in eastern Europe.  Setting up the new Reaction Force is an excellent beginning.  Sanctions that actually hurt on top of this should be compelling.  Ease the sanctions?  Certainly, as soon as the last Russian troops are out of Crimea.","Excellent and concise analysis.  Further, if the west is to show any weakness or hesitancy, Mr. Putin only gains in stature and arrogance (if that were even possible).  Naivete must not be permitted when dealing with this not so newly minted Russian bear.  He has shown himself to be unrelenting, even in the face of shooting down a fully occupied commercial airliner, invading an independent country and boldface lies about the entire operation.  All of that and what has it cost him?  Where is the ICC?  Who is investigating?..The world must prevent these behaviors from becoming the face of the future.  Kiev is not perfect by any means, but the far bigger question is whether we are willing to contain the bear or allow it to roam and decimate freely.  Mr. Putin remains hungry.","Something frighteningly basic is being tested here.  I used to think of Putin as practical but ruthless.  This amazingly reckless transfer of heavy lethal weaponry across borders and apparently into the hands of amateurs (or incompetents, or both) in order that he can claim to be innocent while others do his dirty work is beyond comprehension.  He has spent considerable political coin polishing his image as a strong forthright man, but he now shows himself to be a coward hiding behind his puppets.  If this crime is permitted to stand, the international rule of law is indeed dead and one part of civilization as we know it, dies.","The reason Mr. Putin said that he could be in Kiev in two weeks is because it is true.  The Ukranian government cannot stop him and there is no credible force willing to help with boots on the ground. Obamas calculus of cost and effect based upon American interests is not wrong in this case. Frankly, arming Ukraine will only lengthen the fighting and more lives will be lost just so the US and EU said they did something. Very bad strategy.  Putin is stalwartly determined and neither the US or Europe is willing to match him.  Given what Putin has inadvertently made clear concerning world intentions towards this region, Ukraine must not be allowed to join NATO.",,
Bill M,,,,"Mr. Putin very logically sees American power as an obsession, if Mr. Cohen is correct, but  when American state department officials are visiting Russia's neighbors and American military is shipping large weapons to a trumped up Ukrainian government on Russia's border, it seems quite logical that Mr. Putin would find this a strange way to manifest American neutrality.  America seems to be everywhere around the world, even intruding in the Spratly Island goings on let alone in Ukraine, Yemen, and Okinawa to name a few of our appearances far from our own shores.","As I recall, it was Israel pushing the U.S. to fire cruise missiles into Syria as they sought to have Obama depose Mr. Assad.  So, it doesn't seem that Russia was the source of the devastation of Syria since Mr. Putin was supporting Mr. Assad, and it was more likely Israel with U.S. backing that was the real source of all the havoc which has since ensued.","As a Navy veteran I would like to be able to believe that Mr. Obama is as marvelous a thinker as he is a talker.  His speech at the UN, however, sad to say, comes nowhere near to being as intelligent and to the point as the speech of Mr. Putin.  Mr. Obama has been all over the landscape in his misjudgments in Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya and Syria but he still delivers a collection of homilies that have little to do with solving the real problems we face with much of the Moslem world.  On the other hand, Mr. Putin dealt with the specific problem areas we face and his words seemed at times might have been taken from our Declaration of Independence.  I am greatly heartened by Mr. Putin's speech and hope, as he seemed to indicate, that our two countries can, and must, in the future deal more honestly with out differences than they have in the past","Why is Mr. Obama apparently afraid to meet with Mr. Putin.  Is it because Mr. Obama has allowed Israel and Saudi Arabia to devastate Syria seemingly with Mr. Obama's blessing?  There is no reason why leaders of major nations cannot meet and mutually work out answers to their common problems.  Mr. Obama should drop his personal cold war and get busy working with Mr. Putin to stop the destruction of Syria by ISIS with its reported Saudi Arabia backing.  Nowhere is peace more vitally required than Syria.  So there is no place for petty cold war posturing and Mr. Obama should quit wasting time and welcome constructive talks with Mr. Putin...At the same time, Mr. Obama would do well to get himself some more effective advisers.  The ones he has have allowed Syria to be devastated and made a mess of trying to establish NATO on Russia's front lawn.","Like the rest of us, Mr. Cohen, you paint your own world with your own preconceptions and tribal loyalties.  Instead of painting Mr. Putin with a NATO tinged brush as you do, you could with equal validity paint our hawks in the State Department with the same colors you have daubed on Russia.  A marked difference, however, is that our hawks are over on Russia's border threatening heavy weapon deliveries, more sanctions, and greater efforts to get our NATO allies to shake their fists in Russia's face.  Mr. Cohen might ask himself why he and our hawks are so all fired anxious to demean Mr. Putin and fight Russia.  What's wrong with being friendly with Russia instead of going out of our way to threaten and bad-mouth them?","Yes, but Rihards, Russia of Mr. Putin is not the Soviet of Mr. Stalin.  We cannot in all fairness visit the evils of  Mr. Stalin on Mr. Putin any more than we can visit the evils of Mr. Nixon on Mr. Obama.","Please stop blaming Mr. Putin for setting up a NATO camp in Ukraine that was set up by a squadron of Senators, State Department officials, and NATO sidekicks as part of their sortie into Ukraine to oust the government and install the chocolate oligarch with NATO backing.   Nice ploy to try to blame Mr. Putin for our sortie into Ukraine but our fingerprints are all over the incursion into Russia's front porch.","Mr. Friedman's outrage over Mr. Putin, in which he gives way calling Mr. Putin every evil name he can think of from Hitler to Joseph Goebbels and beyond, is a little hard to explain when one recalls our senators McCain and other senators along with numerous State Department officials,  large and small, on missions to Ukraine to bring down the elected government, which they seem to have been successful in doing.  ..Why Mr. Friedman is so outraged over Mr. Putin and Russia when they seem to be only trying to defend themselves against our NATO attack on their border is a little difficult to understand although it seems to have its roots in Mr. Friedman's support of Israel a country that shares, or feeds, a hatred of Mr. Putin and Russia because they support Syria's and Palestine's opposition to Israel's attempt to take over more and more of Palestine's territory.","Once, again, Mr. Putin seems to have an intelligent grasp of the Syria situation and, unlike our dilly-dallying with Israel and Saudi Wahabi's and producing millions of migrants, he is apparently taking action to deal with the criminal gangs that ISIS (Saudi Arabia, our pal) has been recruiting to take over the country.  Mr. Putin has kept us duly informed of actions he is taking on his and our behalf, and it appears that we should be happy to have found someone who is able to deal directly with the ISISSaudiWahabi threat.","Mr. MacFarquhar and Ms. Barnard seem annoyed that Mr. Putin is stepping in and taking some constructive action in disposing of some of the criminal gangs in Syria as well as the ISIS gangs that we are supposed to be fighting but that we support through our allies in Saudi Arabia.  For two or three years we and our CIA and Pentagon experts have been allowing Syria to fall under the ISISSaudi forces while we have dithered unable to make our minds on an intelligent strategy.   Now, Mr. Putin seems to have decided that some more effective leadership action is needed and he has stepped up to the plate to provide it.  All of our ditherers who have seen Syria destroyed as they fiddled away the need for decisive action are now issuing implied criticisms of Russia for taking action to deal with the problems that we couldn't muster the will to face up to and solve.  Bravo to Mr. Putin and his associates if they can pull off a solution to the Syrian tragedy that we were partly responsible for creating."
Alex,,,,Clearly you haven't been to Yemen lately. What would you prefer? The 'evil regime' of Putin's Crimea or the 'peace and democracy' that the US and Saudis are bringing to Yemen?,"I wonder when was the last time sanctions weakened a totalitarian regime or its interests. And I wonder when was the last time pouring arms into a complex civil war pacified a region. ..The only people that can harm Putin are the Russian People themselves..Syria reminds me of Bosnia and seeing world leaders stuttering in front of the UN logo should make us question again, for what do we have this institution?",Considering that the US has no ideas for stopping ISIS it seems wise to listen to what the Russians are saying as they have been right on everything so far from overthrowing Saddam Hussein and Muammar Khaddafy to attempting to overthrow Bashar Al Assad. President Obama needs to ignore the ideologically bankrupt bloviators at places like the Atlantic council whose dead ideas and childish mentality has truly wrecked the world for at least the last 15 years...How could any serious person think that Russia is inconsequential and that the leader of such a country could be ignored as if he were a disobedient child. Not meeting with Putin and all the immature quibbling about how to meet with him and how it could look is what is making the US look small.,This is a good thing. Russia of course will call it a provocation. But Putin is one of the largest hypocrites in the world continuously provoking its neighbors with words and air and naval trespassing into NATO countries space. Russia is becoming a very fascist country under Putin but they describe anyone who doesn't approve of Russian abusescrimes as Fascist.  Now Putin is even quieting possible dissent of dead Russian soldier families by making it a crime to discuss the location or circumstances of their death. Eastern Europe is all too familiar with this type of Russian abuses as they have experienced it in recent history. Feel sorry for the many Russians who are given false propaganda and have to fear severe punishment for wanting to know the circumstances of their son's deaths for Putin's adventurismfascismimperialism.,Putin just said I am not playing the West's game anymore. The West seems like the dog that ran after the car everyday and now the car has stopped and it does not know what to do!,suggest to finally deprive Obama Nobel Prize of peacemaker and pass it over Putin if Putin will not disdain to take it after Obama,"I guess Putin is upset that so many CEOs canceled their plans to come to St Petersburg. Perhaps also US and EU has found his secret bank accounts and those of his close friends. Only continued pressure should be applied until Putin reverses the annexation of Crimea and removes Russian forces from Ukraine...The next steps are clear FIFA should be pressured to cancel Russia's hosting of the 2018 World Cup, Sberbank, VTB, Gazprom Bank, Alfa Bank, and other government connected banks should be banned from use of the USD and Euro, and the sanctions should spread to all members of the Duma and their family members, and all appointed officials in the Russian executive branch and their family members.","US and EU should think very hard before placing significant sanctions against Russia over Crimea issue..In Russia a very broad consensus does exist regarding Crimea peninsula as a rightful Russian territory.. So, among other things,  western economic sanctions hurting ordinary people in Russia would definitely:.1. give Putin an excuse in the eyes of the Russian public for already faltering domestic economy..2. consolidate public support of Putin whose popularity was in decline in recent years.","You make a lot of claims about the U.S. engineering the revolution in Ukraine, but provide no evidence or even a believable motive. Why would American corporations support this? With Putin stronger than before, and an increase in xenophobia within Russia, there's no chance a Western corporation would make inroads at this point.","Personal sanctions on a few operators is nothing.  If sanctions are not across the board and assured they will have no impact.  This expanding dark empire needs to be ousted from G8 and G20, nobody in the west should be buying their gas, a complete military alliance of all nations still capable of standing up to the new Soviet machine needs to be assured.  The US can no longer make the cuts in troops and defense that they hoped to in the EU.  Putin has assured what he wanted all along, terrible relations with the West."
AD,,,,"It appears the Russian trolls are out in full force this morning, but don't be fooled by their attempts to obfuscate the truth: The Ukrainian people toppled a corrupt, unpopular government by largely peaceful means, and Putin responded by overseeing the annexation of Crimea and starting a civil war in the country's eastern regions. ..This is important to remember as his hired trolls in Russia and apologists in the West try to perpetuate the narrative that the West provoked Putin, as though he were some kind of wild animal unable to control his own behavior. ..As for the common refrain that this is no different than now the U.S. would respond were Russia to position tanks in Mexico, the point is that hasn't happened, and Ukraine is a sovereign country that is free to join NATO andor the EU if it chooses. In addition, remember there was once talk of even Russia joining NATO before it decided to stake out a position for itself as the Anti-West.","While I agree that Putin is behaving recklessly, I also think it's foolhardy for the U.S. to continue pursuing this policy of not doing anything that might help Assad. Assad is certainly a terrible leader, but his rule is the one thing that has kept Syria from disintegrating. We should take a lesson from Iraq, where Hussein's ouster didn't lead to a flourishing democracy, but instead created a dangerously unstable country where ISIS was able to take root and expand, and kicking Assad out of power would no doubt have the same effect in Syria. While Putin supports Assad and we support groups opposed to him, ISIS wins because it's the most organized political entity in Syria other than Assad.",,,,,,,,
Vladimir,,,,"This comment shows complete ignorance both when it comes to Putin and Russians as a nation. ..First of all, apart from building up a positive image, Putin is an intelligent politician. I am not saying I agree with him on anything he does, but he definitely has a strategy and has guts to stand his ground. ..As far as his popularity is concerned, it is not based on him letting Russians buy Western products. I do like Western products, but trust me, I can live without Coca-cola or McDonalds or Ford or Apple. I am not saying I should, because all of these are quite nice in many ways. But if the situation turns out the way that I'll have to live without them, I will, and so will many of us. After all, Russia has many brands of its own able to replace the Western ones (this doesn't apply to computers and cars, since Russian cars are not so good as many Western ones). Nevertheless, we can buy what we need from Asia...I want to be friends with the US. But I do not like to be mistreated, I don't like reading lies about my country. I accept Russia's drawbacks and problems, I apologise for them. But for over a year I haven't read a single balanced and objective article about Russia in the NYTimes, which would portray Russian life as it is, without painting it black. Too bad...","Oh, and I forgot to say - I didn't vote for Putin in any of the elections, nor for his party. And I wasn't going to. However, reading such articles and comments may really make me change some mind, because I often see, that despite my wish, you don't want to understand us, you don't want to respect us and you don't want to cooperate with us. You'd prefer to have us poor, stripped of our resources, of our military, with a government that would be controlled by your State Department. Would we, the people, live better then? I've seen Yugoslavia and I don't think so.","Dear Ecce,..Even though I am totally against this new law which you are talking about, I have to point out that you clearly do not know what it means. Putin is not shutting down blogs that aren't registered with the government, it's ridiculous! The law states that a blog which has a large (over several thousand) number of subscribers, should comply with the rules that the regular media comply with. None of these rules mean you will be shut down if you criticize the government. ..And as far as controlling the Internet is concerned - that is something I do not wish to see, though for every government it is something they want to do. However, you tend to forget that it is the NSA that is spying on everyone around the globe via networks. Even if Russia does that, too - we are not alone, America actually started that...In Russia we do have opposition newspapers, blogs and other media. But you do not know about them, because your free press doesn't tell you about them. Because if it TELLS you about them, it will DESTROY the image of Russia as an authoritarian country. Which it isn't, actually. And your free press, along with your government, need that image so much to justify your own actions...I really hate to write it now, because I do love American and English culture and I have friends among my American co-workers. I am really sorry for telling all this, guys. I wouldn't have if I hadn't seen so much hatred and misunderstanding among common Americans about my country.","Jodi, why don't you learn some history? Among the countries which tried to invade Russia were Poland, France, Germany, as well as the Mongols, and that's not all yet...Russia is the world's richest country in natural resources. I am not saying the West wants to invade Russia. No. But to see Russia weak and unable to protect itself, to exploit its resources - definitely, yes. What are all the US oil companies now doing in Iraq? Oh, and by the way, has the US war in Iraq brought Iraqi people any good?..Also, as for nothing of value, you are obviously not that enlightened as to know, how many of America's great achievements were actually performed by other nations, including the Russians. Take Brin or Sikorski, for instance...I do agree with you, though, when you speak of logic. Americans who say the US should supply arms to Ukraine are definitely out of not only logic, but humanity and compassion. Peaceful residents are being killed in Donbas daily due to the Ukrainian army shelling the cities. Yesterday three children were killed in Donetsk only. Why is Putin the only person to blame? What about Poroshenko and his army killing civilians?","I wonder why Russia is the enemy of the USA and the world? I am Russian, I am 32, I am a teacher of English. In my school I work with my American and British colleagues. I am not oppressed, as you see - I can write whatever I think here and no dictator is coming to get me even if I say that Putin is not a leader of my dreams (which is actually true, I strongly disagree with what he does in terms of internal politics and economy). But anyway, like I said, I am Russian, Moreover, I am Christian, I have two legs, two arms and no tail. Why am I the enemy to the whole world and the USA, Peter?..Oh, and by the way, for the past couple of decades my country has only fought wars on its former territory - the wars which the USA would have probably fought in a much more devastating way if you were in our shoes...But still, I am against all kinds of wars. Now why am I the enemy of Americans and the world?","Nora, in Russia we do have the problem of corruption along with many others. Freedom of speech may be another issue, but not so much as you think...Now, just to let you know - Putin hasn't killed any of his opponents, and there is no Gulag anymore. Please, come to Russia and see for yourself if you don't believe me. Like I said in one of my previous posts, I am a teacher of English and there are a few Americans and British colleagues working in my school. All of them actually like it here. ..I am not trying to say Russia is paradise or anywhere close to America or Western Europe in terms of economy (I mean salaries), ecology and bribery. But things are not as bad as you think. ..I'd rather agree with David. As for me, being a teacher over the past few years I went to Thailand, then Indonesia, then Turkey on holiday and hope to visit more of the world, including the US in the next few years. That would hardly be possible in the Soviet times. So please, try to understand that things have actually changed and we are not what we used to be. ..I'd say the only reason why Putin behaves like that in terms of his foreign policy is because he feels there is a direct threat to Russia (and I mean the country and the population, not just the national interests).","Despite my strong disapproval of Putin's actions and the fact that I don't believe his words, there are things that strike me when I read American media...Here, in Russia, I have always been against this anti-American propaganda which has been on state-owned TV channels for the past few years (not all of them, though). I do think America is a great country and Russia is wrong in many ways...BUT!..Why does this particular story call the people who attacked Grozny the insurgents? What is the difference between them (terrorists who attacked a school) and people from IGIL? Is it like that when Russians die only? Or when those people fight against Russia? They are insurgents then and freedom fighters, but when it's aimed at the USA they suddenly become terrorists...This is the kind of disrespect and hypocrisy Putin has been talking about for years. If you want to be a truly moral example for the rest of the world, start calling things what they are and get rid of double standards, please.","You are absolutely right, Russia cannot stand up to the West militarily...Why then is NATO expanding? Why is Obama quick to reassure Poland and Baltic countries of military support? Why do the Western media speculate on the topic of Putin creating a new USSR and Europe being threatened?..Russia is weak, in comparison with Europe or the US. Maybe it's because all these words about Russian aggression are in fact used as a pretext to encircle Russia with military bases and to possibly justify NATO's military incursion (not today, not tomorrow, but in the future)? Of course, all invasions these days are done to protect someone...And if you say NATO doesn't need to invade Russia, then you need to remember that Russia is the world's richest country in natural resources. Period.","You have been talking about Russia invading Ukraine here for months. Over and over again. Has Russia invaded? No. If it wanted to, it would have long ago. ..You are ready to accept any information unverified if it comes from the current Ukrainian government or the US State Department (both known for lies), but no information from the other side is allowed. Where is the free press?..Now, Russia is sending humanitarian aid for people (many of them ethnic Russians) who are suffering. You say it is a lie. My question is - do you really think Putin is so stupid he will organise an invasion? Especially under such a pretext?..And another question - who gave you, the American public, the right to decide what should people do in the country that is thousands of miles away from you? And why do you think you can talk about depriving people of food and medicine just because YOU SUPPOSE that it is something else?","I hope not all people in the US are like those who comment here. The comments are full of hatred! Moreover, you're literally unaware of the real situation in Ukraine now, in Donetsk or Luhansk. There is war there and both sides are guilty. The separatists and the Ukrainian army. But WHY is it OK for the Ukrainian army to BOMB cities? Why are you all fine with that? I see photos and videos of dead people, women, men, children almost everyday. It is not propaganda, it's footage from local residents. Why is it never shown on American TV? Why is the NYTimes silent about that?..You blame Russia - do you have ANY idea about WHO's in power in Ukraine now? Lyashko, Kolomoisky - do you think they are democratically elected leaders? You don't know anything about them. But they're real bandits. ..Of course, it is more convenient and easier for you to blame Russia. Than to actually try to gather some objective information from BOTH sides in equal proportions. And I don't mean quotes from politicians. I mean stories and footage from people on the ground...I deeply regret that the politicians have managed to make Americans hate Russians. We are all people, we are very much alike, and none of us is better than another, Putin, Obama, Poroshenko - they are all liars. But the thing is Putin is bad when it comes to domestic policy. He is a lot more honest in terms of international affairs. Obama - well, you tell me about his domestic policy, but in terms of international affairs he is a liar."

Swami,,,,"Why should we believe this reporting from a western newspaper as much as i should not take at face value everything that Putin's government says. That said, we all need a good amount of research and analysis to come to a conclusion on who is on the right. I suspect we will find that it is just a game of supremacy between the west and east that is not black and white.",It is difficult to say what is driving the disingenuous and misleading rhetoric by Obama and most of the US congress. Is it just plain allegiance to their geo-political goals to support Israel and Sunni arabs? Or is it just plain arrogance?.It is apparent for any objective observer that Mr. Putin is right on Syria and Ukraine.,"Let us flip the scenario. If Russia had supported a violent overthrow of an elected government in a neighbouring country of the US, which was part of it's previous union.. would the US keep quite?.I think Putin was right to complain. The only difference is i would have annexed the whole of Ukraine.",Russia might have supplied arms to the rebels.. but Mr. Putin cannot be personally held responsible for the incident..Supplying arms to sympathetic groups is something the west is very familiar with and it has caused much more destruction in this world than this plane incident...This whole incident has been cynically used the US and it's western cronies to achieve their goal of politically isolating and destroying Putin so that they can continue their hegemony...,"Mr. Friedman. You are just like most westerners. Your condescending attitude towards why Putin is doing this is articulated in this statement but this seems to have become so fundamental to his domestic politics that it has locked him into a zero-sum relationship with the West.This is the standard, arrogant response from westerners.. that any foreign leader who does something anti-western is doing so because of domestic politics. It is almost as if the west is too arrogant to admit that someone might have genuine foregn policy and startegic differences with them..I bet Putin is not doing this because of domestic politics. He is much smarter than that. He has a genuine angst against the western led plan to maintain hegemony in developing countries by any means possible, including violence, civil wars and wars.",,,,,
AK,,,,"Any working relationship involves give and take. If you only want to take, the other party will soon stop cooperating. The real reason it is so difficult for Obama people to go ahead and schedule a meeting with Putin is this: Obama cannot be seen giving Russia anything, and even just meeting with Russia's president is viewed as giving Russia something. ..U.S. policy makers cannot accept simple facts: (1) Russia is a major power, (2) Russia has interests, including in Syria, and (3) if the US wants Russia's cooperation, some of these interests must be accommodated. ..Instead of doing what they are told, those pesky Russians do what they think is best for them. Who do they think they are? An independent country?","The real reason it is so difficult for the Obama administration to go ahead and schedule a meeting with Putin is this: Obama cannot be seen giving Russia anything, and even just meeting with Russia's president is viewed as giving Russia something.

Any working relationship involves give and take. If you only want to take, the other party stops cooperating. ..Obama should show some leadership, talk to Putin and look for a realistic path forward in Syria.","I agree with one thing in Friedman's piece: that Putin is a czar. Everything else is pure propaganda. Propaganda begins with fundamental dishonesty. The propagandist denies that the adversary has any legitimate interests he is trying to protect. The logical conclusion is the adversary is doing what he is doing because he is evil. The rest is easy: it's about good good guys (Ukrainian reformers) versus bad guys (that thug Putin). We must help the good guys! Let's give them money and weapons to kill the bad guys! (Over the last few years, Friedman has advocated the same in Iraq, Lybia, and Syria. We know how that worked out.)..So, what are those fundamental interests that Friedman ignores in this case? Russia has been saying for years that it views NATO expansion to Ukraine as an unacceptable national security threat. The West went ahead and supported a regime change in Kiev. The new government was virulently anti-Russian from the start. That made expansion of NATO to Ukraine only a matter of time. (By the way, every Eastern European member of the EU is a member of NATO.) In response, Russia has acted to remove that threat. And it will keep going until the threat is removed. ..Once the West agrees to guarantee military neutrality of Ukraine, this crisis will quickly die down. ..For an honest analysis of the interests driving the Ukrainian conflict, check out this essay by George Friedman, Chairman of Stratfor: <a hrefhttp:www.stratfor.comweeklyviewing-russia-insideaxzz3Q7jzEq5j titlehttp:www.stratfor.comweeklyviewing-russia-insideaxzz3Q7jzEq5j targetblank>http:www.stratfor.comweeklyviewing-russia-insideaxzz3Q7jzEq5j<a>","There is a joke making the rounds in Eastern Ukraine and Russia now: the US will fight Russia in Ukraine to the last Ukrainian. I think there is some truth to that. Stopping the war on terms that give Russia anything undermines the existing US-centered world order. From the standpoint of people in the State Department, that must be prevented at all costs. We will see this in the US response to the Putin's proposal discussed here and to other similar proposals...There is a lesson here to citizens of client states. When your sponsor's interests contradict your own, the sponsor will pick his interests any day.","Vladimir Putin's name is mentioned 10 times in this article, and the current Ukrainian government is not mentioned at all. The implication is that that the government bears no responsibility for the unfolding disaster in eastern Ukraine and that everything the government does is for the best. Many of residents of eastern Ukraine would disagree. They blame Kiev for the recent escalation of violence. Could they possibly have a point? But then, why should we listen to them? The government calls them terrorists.","The author reminds us that Cold War 2.0 will be costly. Who will be willing to pay the price? Putin sees the possible expansion of NATO to Ukraine as a major security threat. When NATO bombed Serbia in 1999, it made an impression on the Russians... If you believe your security is at stake, you are willing to pay a high price...I am Russian and lived in Russia in 1990s. The Yeltsins government was incredibly corrupt and incompetent. Many people were not getting paid for months. But government officials were getting filthy rich. American officials approvingly called them the young reformers. Oligarchs plundered Russia's resources. They were admiringly called baby billionaires. Corruption and chaos in Russia didn't matter as long as Yeltsin did not insist on having independent foreign (and, for that matter, domestic) policy. ..Most Russians will see economic sanctions as punishment for daring to defend Russias interests. If you think your countrys independence is at stake, you are willing to pay a high price...Consider the war in Vietnam. The US lost that war to a third-world country. Why? Simple: The Vietnamese were willing to pay any price, bear any burden to unify the country. The US could not match that, and for a good reason: there was no vital national interest at stake...I have not seen a convincing argument that something truly important to most Americans is at stake in the Ukrainian crisis. Why escalate a fight if you are not willing to bleed?","The events of the last few days made it clear that Putin will not allow Kiev to quash the Donbass rebellion. The die has been cast. Continuing attempts by Kiev to solve the problem militarily will just result in further escalation, possibly leading to open war between Ukraine and Russia. An open war will be a disaster for both sides, but it will be much worse for Ukraine. What must be on Poroshenkos mind is What deal can I make with Putin and still hold on to power? ..Did it have to happen this way? Back in April, before the war started, the Russians made their demands clear. They asked for more autonomy of Russian speakers within Ukraine and for Ukrainian neutrality (no NATO membership). These requirements were rejected out of hand. Now, after thousands of people have died, we will see the same issues raised. Even the Germans are talking about federalization of Ukraine now: <a hrefhttp:www.reuters.comarticle20140823us-ukraine-crisis-germany-gabriel-idUSKBN0GN08X20140823 titlehttp:www.reuters.comarticle20140823us-ukraine-crisis-germany-gabriel-idUSKBN0GN08X20140823 targetblank>http:www.reuters.comarticle20140823us-ukraine-crisis-germany-gabr...<a>. Unfortunately, its hard to see how Donbass can remain part of Ukraine, after so much blood has been spilled...President Poroshenko seems to have one similarity with his predecessor, the deposed president Yanukovich. Like Yanukovich, he underestimates his opponents. When he does make concessions, he tends to be a day late and a dollar short Yanukovich lost it all in the end. For the sake of Ukraine and Russia, I hope President Poroshenko does better.","If Putin were Hitler, he would have launched a massive invasion of Ukraine last April. There would now be a puppet Russian government in Kiev (instead of the puppet American one). The events have shown that Russia has much more limited aims in this conflict. Here's what UK's former ambassador to Russia says about this: <a hrefhttp:www.independent.co.ukvoicescommentis-no-one-in-the-west-trying-to-do-a-deal-with-putin-9955854.html titlehttp:www.independent.co.ukvoicescommentis-no-one-in-the-west-trying-to-do-a-deal-with-putin-9955854.html targetblank>http:www.independent.co.ukvoicescommentis-no-one-in-the-west-trying...<a>.","Putin knows that direct military intervention in Ukraine would mean a big war. He won't do it. He's not that stupid. He doesn't make big decisions on an impulse; he plays his cards well. He may actually become part of the solution, for example, if he gets iron-clad guarantees that Ukraine will not become part of NATO. But he won't believe empty words.

Carolyn Egeli,,,,"I'd say let Putin have Crimea..as if we have a right to have a say about it. Really. Why get into what amounts to a global war with Russia? It would be a wonderful time for China, India, and the rest of everyone who's had enough of us to smoosh us. Don't think they wouldn't like to. We have been not everyone's favorite for quite some time now. Let's not be foolish, but change our own ways, to get along better in the world, starting with a peaceful initiative, emphasising the recovery from addiction to fossil fuels! and putting a lid on multi-national corporations that have simply run the entire show, using American resources far too long.","Pope Francis efforts are to be commended. But I don't see the devil in Putin. I see oil and gas interests in competition with Russian oil and gas, and that is all this is about. I also see Putin has much support from Russians. He must be doing something they approve of. I read about Biden's connection through family to a pipeline company in the Ukraine. Seems like a conflict of interest to me, but if not that, then a definite crony capitalism thing going on. What I can't stand is hypocrisy and I see a boat load of it here. No, NATO isn't going to invade Russia, but its members don't mind marginalizing her. Russia can't be blamed for looking after its own interests. This is happening, if no one noticed, right on Russia's borders. Putin may not be a nice guy, but the Russians have more important standards when it comes to their safety, even if they have the same oligarch and plutocrat problems we have. I don't equate capitalism with democracy. They are not one in the same. We have capitalism in the West, but little democracy left. Commerce runs everything, including our government. True, it always has, but the veil is off for me. The view is clear as a bell. And I am no longer fooled by propaganda for what is just a game of commercial power and control over mostly oil and gas, but not exclusive to that.","I feel for the people of the Ukraine. Just get out of there. Let's quit fighting Chevron's battles and other interests in the Ukraine. Let's build solar, libraries, bridges and mass transit at home. Let's quit lining the pockets of lenders of wars and war profiteers. NATO has encroached too far and made the Russians nervous. Why must this go on? Check for yourself who is profitting from this and it is not about bad Putin versus righteous U.S. or even good Putin versus evil West. It's about money and control of resources. ALWAYS. If you can't find it, look a little harder.","To my eyes, the Russians have been pretty patient with the West, and its noodling around its southern and western borders for several decades or more. Putin probably has had enough, with the trouble in Ukraine a wake up call to him, about just how far the western plutocrats and oligarchs are willing to go to secure control over the assets of the entire region, which is gas, oil and its transporting and perhaps its fracking. Maybe he did get schmoozed a bit by President Obama, and found himself getting bested and put a stop to it. Maybe he actually thought things could be smoothed over and worked out and so felt betrayed as this article suggests. I'm not in favor of Russia over my own country. All people want the same thingspeace and prosperity. I don't think either of our countries are exactly great examples of democracy with our NSA surveillance, militarized police, the CIA and congress fighting over authority, and Russia's Putin throwing little girls in prison and stomping on protesters. Commercial interests are what we should be looking atyou know the old sayingfollow the money! That is where the truth will show up.","WE can stop this war. WE can remove our selves from the battle over who sells gas to Europe and get ourselves out of the mess with the IMF. WE have NO business in Ukraine. Putin is defending his arena, much like we would if he were in Mexico. We are not defending American values in the Ukraine. We are challenging Russia over who is selling and transporting to Europe. We are defending commercial interests and this is NOT in the interests of the American people. Americans do not need American gas to rise in price, nor do we need any more of our water and land destroyed in the pursuit of natural gas. Russia's gas is cleaner. Let them sell it.","Why do we care about Putin? Why do we believe everything that is written? Are we sure Putin took down that plane of innocents? I am not sure of it. There are powerful economic oil and gas interests at work in the Ukraine. Our CIA is famous for fomenting economic and political disruption for the gain of our very own plutocrats all around the world. I do not think Putin is extraordinarily different than hundreds of other leaders in the world, who are corrupted with power. In all of these leaders, there are some who have a modicum of caring for their people. I see Putin, as taking care of himself, but also looking after the interests of his country. We hope our leaders do the same and their interests are our interests.  Oligarchs and plutocrats are in both of our countries. They have always existed but now seem more powerful. I don't see Putin as any more or less self interested than many of our own leaders. Power and greed is multinational. This is our present human condition. We need to overcome this and see ourselves as one human family who would benefit more from helping one another, rather than get fixated on one man's personality issues. We should not take for granted what we read in our gossip sheets, and get the other side's point of view also. We should see our own benefit in another's as a general goal.","Read a piece on Putin in the NEW YORK BOOK REVIEW. He is a shaker and a mover along with his buddies, rigging the rules in their favorjust like the shakers and movers do here! My mywhat a surprise! We share a lot with the Russian people..each population being told about the evil others so far away.","I don't consider myself an admirer of Putin, but the Putin bashing seems over the top to me. Naturally, Putin is extending global courtships. He would be stupid not to. It is not desperation that I see. Putin has been working on this a while now. India, China and Russia were a few countries that met to get out from under the dollar for the sale of oil last year. They agreed to use different currencies. Some say this is not particularly a threat, but could it be, that the US is actually the one fighting back for its dollar? The use of cyber world type attacks, and the flooding of cheap oil onto the market may or may not have conspirator roots in international intrigue, but it does appear it might! Meanwhile, I LOVE that it may all be for nought, as renewables take over the energy market exponentially and sooner rather then later. Most countries in the world are working to get off of oil. What are we doing? Playing chess with Putin over a dead end energy source. The Balkans, North Korea, Sudan, the entire Middle East, and other hot spots are nearly all about conflagrations over who is going to control oil, gas, and its distribution and war profiteers. Enough! Let's get busy building a new renewable energy infrastructure and catch up with the rest of the world.","Yes, you are correct about the mentioning of oil and gas. The article makes Putin and Russia the bad guys. But corporations seek to denationalize assets whenever possible. NATO and the west, threaten Russia's borders, so Russia responds. What are we doing there? It is not our business but Europe's. Corporations would like to sell to Europe themselves and would like to own the assets of oil and gas and its distribution along the borders of Russia, effectively isolating Russia. Americans would be upset, if Russia were messing with oil in Mexico or off our ocean shores. I don't understand why we must be involved as a country.",The Malaysia Airline Flight 17 being shot down is a senseless human tragedy. I am so sorry for the people who lost their lives and their loved ones. Nobody can bring back the precious lives of its victims no matter what Putin says or who shot it down. I wonder HOW and WHY it happened. Was there a  purpose or was it ignorance? We must be careful to not allow anything to turn this event into an excuse to expand the conflict and create even more tragedy than has happened already.
timoty,,,,"Mr. Cohen is right, the battle for Ukraine is going to be long...The west is superb in encouraging and supporting uprisings and revolutions in other countries. But when it is over and the good guys have won, the west loses interest; Ukraine, Georgia and the Arab spring come to mind...Mr. Putin knows this, of course, and he can wait. He has no terms limits and can be the top dog in Russia as long as he wants to...The oil price is going to go up eventually and after that the battle for Ukraine is going to be even longer.","It's good to see that Mr. Friedman can accept that he may have been wrong. Now, however, he is absolutely right. The West needs to get even tougher with Mr. Putin, not just the US but the EU as well...However, there is too much appeasement in the air here in the EU. Hints of finlandization, too. Mr. Putin will try to take advantage of that.","What makes the situation even more difficult is the dysfunctional EU not being able and willing to hit Mr. Putin where it hurts the most. So far, it has been only the US sanctions that have had any impact. But on the European side it is the Goldilocks policy that rules the roost - unfortunately. Mr. Putin knows it, so he can afford to behave the way he does.","So true!..For Russians democracy means chaos, stealing and pilfering of the Yeltsin years. ..When you add to that Mr. Putin's yearning for the power and influence being the head of a superpower (USSR once was) brings, results can be disastrous...But yearn for power is no substitute for lack of a strategic mind, and he is no strategist - he is an opportunist. ..He sees an opening and he tries to use it to his advantage without thinking about the negative consequences. ..Those are for rest of the world to worry about and resolve.",In my mind it's quite extra ordinary that Ukraine - at least in Mr. Putin's opinion - should not be able and allowed to monitor and protect its own borders...What kind of an agreement is that? ..It is an open invitation to low level continued fighting in the Donbas area. I'm afraid this agreement doesn't solve anything.,"What exactly did GWB see, when he said he saw Mr. Putin's soul? I think we should be told...The more we read about Mr. Putin's pals, the scarier it gets.","People, who were expecting something good from this latest round of talks and signed papers, were only fooling themselves...Mr. Putin knows very well that the west is not going to start a war with Russia, or supply Ukraine with offensive weapons. Besides, while those weapons (offensive or defensive) were being shipped and Ukrainian soldiers trained to use them, would he just sit back and wait?.Russia's army and its weaponry are its only strength. The economy with its technology its weaknesses...What we should do is something like Fed's QE was to the US economy; something unexpected, a lightning from clear blue sky; Big and Dramatic move that sucks the air out.","You are absolutely right when you write that just as democracies are slow to move, and association of democracies like the European Union is even slower. Mr. Putin is exploiting this. He has read his Macchiavelli and knows how divide and conquer..Mr. Putin fears only one thing; the USA. The EU is good only for endless talks and meetings leading to useless compromises .","Russia's behaviour is getting more and more irresponsible. ..There's a good saying that applies to Mr. Putin quite well Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are. Who are Mr. Putin's friends and allies?","If these volunteers were to fight for someone and somewhere else, they would be called mercenaries...Mr. Putin doesn't have worry about quagmires and being bogged down, he has his stratospheric approval ratings in Russia and that's enough - unfortunately."
AO,,,,I guess you have read very little or none at all of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Russia operated on the slave labor of its people and the cannon fodder of its armies after most of the experienced officers were purged by Stalin. Stalin also decided to sign a treaty with Hitler and partition Poland and attack Finland. So Stalin and Communism (not the Russian people) got what they deserved. I believe that the US sent quite a bit of aid to the Soviets and that we are probably still waiting for payment. Currently Russia is even more corrupt than the US and Putin is delusional and repressive.,,,,,,,,,
Fred Bauder,,,,"The killing of protestors by snipping is missing in this article. The inflammatory effect of this was central to mobilization of Ukrainian resistance forces. I doubt Putin is well versed in what happens in a population following such an Alamo event; although much of historic Soviet repression was intended to avoid such symbolic events...Russia's situation. surrounded by the weak governments of former Soviet republics headed by kleptocratic strong men, is inherently unstable. The result is that any democratic movement, healthy or otherwise, will result in a crisis, a crisis that can only be dealt with on an ad hoc basis. Clever exploitation of this by the West is dangerous.","Putin is not blowing smoke when he says the oil was not a consideration. The oil in the Black Sea is only a small play for them. There are vast undeveloped resources in Russia such as the Bazhenov Formation  in the West Siberian basin. However, the Black Sea prospects might make a good bargaining chip in their negotiations with Ukraine.",Obviously a person who has never shared a bottle of wine with an ordinary Ukrainian and listened to the usual opinion about Russia. He speaks of brothers; little does he know.

Putin, I bet, will set up a puppet government in Crimea and control it from outside. Russian soldiers now in Crimea will remain there but change from military fatigues to Jeans and T-shirts. Crimea changes it currency to ruble, but colors it pink and green.  This, practical annexation, is not considered annexation by the US and the rest of the west for the purposes of sanctions, so there will be no sanctions. later, this summer, Russia will sign a defense treaty with Crimea and the Russian troupes will change back into military fatigues. Thus Putin gets Crimea and gets to export his oil to EU. Republicans and Fox news will again sing praises of sexy clever Putin and call our black president sissy and weak.",,,,,,

What if Tsar Vladimir 1er  decides a full Invasion? Would you be ready to go fight there?.Economic Sanctions are the most effective way to achieve Peace in Ukraine.","Could it be that Putin is just trying to divide Europeans who were getting ready to vote for more stronger Sanctions against Russia?  First there were no Russian Soldiers in Crimea he said, then admitted after the Invasion . Now he is negotiating  Cease-Fire directly with Ukraine for  a War he claims Russia is not part of. If the Rest of the World falls for it, Putin will keep going on with his Lies until it's too late.","THE US AMBASSADOR AT THE UN SAID: Instead of listening, instead of heeding the demands of the international community and the rules of the international order, at every step, Russia has come before this Council to say everything except the truth, said Samantha Power, the United States ambassador. It has manipulated. It has obfuscated. It has outright lied. So we have learned to measure Russia by its actions and not by its words..  Replace Russia with USA in the paragraph above and it will also sound true. That been said,  what can be done to stop Putin? The Man  thinks he was put on Earth to save Russia. Some fact speak for him. Before he took over as president, Russia was in free fall. Putin turned thong around due to higher than expected oil revenues. He invaded Georgia ,the EU and  President Bush did nothing (  Senators McCain and Graham must have been on a Moon mission, nobody heard them asking for invasion or military intervention back then)..The World rewarded him by awarding Russia the 2014 Winter Olympic and the 2018 World Cup. Putin put Russia back on the world map.  Now he wants to defend all Russian speaking people wherever they are. No surprise  Russian Volunteers are crossing the border to do exactly what the Putin and Russian media are asking them to do..Unless Europe and the US , applies very severe sanctions that would be felt right away by ordinary Russians, and make Putin (not Russia) feel irrelevant in the world stage, Putin will not change.","As the article mentions, European and Russian economies are so interconnected that  strong economic sanctions will also hurt the EU..Instead the US and its allies should  let the FIFA know  that they will boycott the 2018 world cup tournament which is to be hosted by Russia .  On top of that the EU can ban Russia sports teams from all European tournaments..Sanctions like those could be more effective. We know how much Putin spent for the Sotchi Olympic which is nothing compared to a world cup in terms of audience.. France is willing to sell advance weapons to a country that just annexed its neighbor. Germany receives 30 of its Gaz from Russia. There are more Russian billionaires in London than in Moscow. Obama can say what he wants, but I don't see how he could convince the EU for more economic sanctions.","Can the NYTimes stop saying article after article how high Poutine approval rating is. Obama also would have an approval rating of 80 to 90 if most news organizations in this country looked exactly like MSNBC and Huffington post.. Russians, unlike those living in  Moscow, Saint Petersburg and few other cities, are poor. SO sanctions will not affect them that much. But they'll believe in the propaganda being fed to them daily by Russian Televisions.. History seems to repeat itself. There was a man that in 1930's (I will not name here, I don't want to compare him to Putin as of yet) in Europe who wanted to protect all Germans like Putin wants to protect all Russians. Both have a lot in common: Short, Putine is 5.4 He was 5.7. He had his Olympics game in 1936, Putin had his in 2014.  His approval rating was sky high, like Putin approval rating.

Dean H Hewitt,,,,"This is the natural progression for Putin.  Gobble as much as they can, digest it and then take another bite.  I would suspect if they get the water bridge to Crimea, it may be enough for Putin along with the Eastern parts of Ukraine..I suspect Ukraine will have an easier time controlling and running a country without the Eastern sections.  Russia will soon gobble that into Russia along with the parts they took from Georgia.","If you give weapons of complexity to rouge units you should expect something like this happening.  Why did Putin give these weapons to this crew of malcontents, because nobody seemed to care.  This is in Europe's backyard and it is their fault.  Sorry, they can blame it all on Putin, but the reality is they are working with Russia and their leaders and are just too comfortable to complain.  Well, this happened, so deal with the reality that states can not move into other states with impunity.  The US has a small amount of responsibility on this, but maybe it's the lesson needed to get us out of the Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan for good.  I suggest we start using that 100 billion a year we are dumping into those countries to help Mexico, Central America and even Puerto Rico.  This is OUR backyard.","Lots of speculation going on even in this editorial.  I suspect that someone may have asked Putin what he wanted the end result to be.  and I bet he didn't know.  Grabbing a bigger piece of the Crimea for what....   May be five years of bad relations with a group of countries who really want Russia to be a successful country...   i hope everyone takes a couple of deep breaths and realize none of this was needed.  Russia Ukraine and Europe all need each other, period.","Bad behavior is bad behavior.  That Putin wanted the whole peninsula of Crimea probably shouldn't surprise us.  My fear is he may want to take another bite of the Ukraine as a penalty for getting rid of a terrible president.  So it is time to kick him out or at least suspend his membership in the G-8.  Let Putin stew after Europe and the US tells him to sit in the corner.  It will be harder for Europe with the need for natural gas, but Europe was an idiot to get rid of Nuclear energy production.  But Russia will need the money even more with the limits on trade with the West.  I would like the US to get after Syria now, but I doubt Obama has a set to do right.",,,,,,

History teaches that civil wars never end up in truth, like sometimes happens with wars between countries. One or another site must win. Putin has recently said in his interview that HE WILL NOT let Kiev win. And he will keep his word with or without arms shipments from the West.","Putin is a statesman, he knows how do deal with issues without much bloodshed.","I see that many participants here do not like the idea of Russian trucks bringing food to besieged population without permission of Ukraine government.

Sanctions have been quite affective and has proven the way to combat the present situation. Putin in a financial dilemma annexed the Crimea to assuage his people and frighten his European neighbors.

The price of oil, sanctions over the Ukraine, the fall of the Ruble, Russia's economic debacle, inflation, debt repayment, have cascaded upon him with such rapidity that it is quite beyond his control to deal with such deluge. At least in its present state, what machination does he have to stem the leaks in the dam?. Putin is a Pragmatist. This is one of his strengths in his climb to power. His trusted advisors are at their own wits ends on how to come to terms on deal with the economic maelstroms that are beseiging them from.  Money. The need for currency. There are no simple answers to the continued fall of Russia's major import; oil. And therein lies the rub.","In time, Russian forays into NATO space will backfire on them.

Russia used this lopsided advantageous position to take what it wanted by force, weighing its upper hand militarily and doubting that the West had any means or the will to hurt Russia otherwise. Totally criminal behavior from a world superpower. The West must now show Putin that Might DOES NOT make right and persist without firing a shot (there will come a time sooner or later that Ukraine, the EU and U.S. will have the upper hand again, and then they must squeeze.) Look at the photo of Putin and his gang of thugs laughing it up. Laugh now boys, you may not be laughing for long! Don't forget, the world changes constantly.

They must settle and the world must prepare for Putin's next land-grab.,A valuable analysis that considers Putin's various actions and finds the common motive behind them. Hats off to an opinion piece worth its pixels.,"Mitt Romney was right.  Barack Obama was wrong, and the Times backed Obama all the way...The NY Times has once again proven itself incapable of holding President Obama responsible for anything.  Every time Putin is aggressive, the Times wrings its hands and cries that he is a bad man.  In the West, no one is disputing that Putin is bully (but he is also clever and effective).  The question before us is whether we have the right policy and leadership to deal with an aggressor as significant as Russia, and the answer on the ground is consistently, no...Maybe, just maybe Mr. Putin considers Mr. Obama weak, because President Obama is weak.  How can we possibly argue with Putin ignoring the coalition already being led by the United States, when said coalition is groping in the dark with absolutely no direction or purpose?..What is President Obama's strategy for dealing with Syria and with the Islamic State.  No one can articulate the Administration's strategy.   This is because President Obama is committed to a vision of the world that simply does not exist.  As much as he does not want to be at war with Islamic Extremists, they are committed to war with us and our allies...Because the United States refuses to lead, counties beleaguered by Islamic Extremists will begin to turn to Russia for help, and the world will increasingly be shaped in Putin's image.","Since Putin's father was in the bodyguard detail for Stalin, and then Kruschev, the boy learned skullduggery at his father's knee, just as Junior Gotti did.  Putin must've been pleased a few years ago when the dissident was jabbed on a London bridge by a ricin-tipped umbrella, which killed him a few weeks later.  The same mentality that murdered the Romanovs prevails today, with smugness.","Seems like Putin is making another chess move.  Hope the US isn't 4 moves behind him like last time.  Putin's queen is all over the board and what appears to be our (Ukranian) pawns, have already been taken."
Al,,,,"I actually think this is a pretty good precedent for international law: a people expressed their right to self-determination, an outside power guaranteed a bloodless separation, and the new nation (and even the old one!) will receive billions in reconstruction funds. ..I'm sure once the money starts rolling in and an economy ruined by Kyiv's perennial kleptocracy start coming alive, Crimeans will feel reaffirmed in their decision for independence from the likes of Yanukovich (the old kleptocrat-in-chief) and Tymoshenko (an old kleptocrat who is now back in power again). ..On a separate note, the Tatars were smart to boycott the vote. Now Putin will spend extra on them...Why exactly should the US hurt ordinary Russians (which now includes the Crimeans), when the Crimeans and Ukrainians (Putin will probably try to buy their blessing on this) are now so much better off?","Speaking of oil, I guess this is one way that Putin can recover the losses. This will force Saudi into negotiation or, arguably, into an open confrontation.","He can't back down or Russia will be lost and that is why he will go nuclear if he must. There are 85 of the Russian people that agree with him. I talk to Russians and Ukrainians and they all hate the US for starting this war where these people are needlessly murdering each other. When the US, NATO, and EU overthrew the Yanukovich Govt. and installed the Junta, they really blew it. If they'd have honored the Feb. 21 agreement, all of these deaths could have been avoided and the conditions of that agreement aren't that different from Minsk2. The US, NATO, EU, and Junta had the upper hand and thought Putin wouldn't fight them. They thought they could go to the Donbass and slaughter the people and have all of Ukraine and then let the bankers rape the whole country through the IMF. It appears the people of the Donbass want to live and be left alone. I think if this ceasefire doesn't hold, they will go to Western Ukraine and kill enough of them so they can live in peace. This needs to stop now and the US, EU, NATO, and Junta need to understand they really screwed up when they started this insanity. Just another total disaster created by the US which helps no one.","Give the eastern part of Ukraine to Russia.  And make Putin pay by turning the remainder of Ukraine in to a NATO country.  All lose all win, the crisis is solved!","Speaking of oil, I guess this is one way that Putin can recover the losses. This will force Saudi into negotiation or, arguably, into an open confrontation.","I just wish people would see past the propoganda. Like most wars, this one isn't being fought over high-ideals or scarce resources, but for money and power. Western leaders supported the ouster of Yanukovych because they wanted to pry Ukraine's market open to their corporate allies. Supporting the Maidan movement also improved public opinion of them at home (helping these leaders stay in power longer). Putin started the war because he's a dictator and needs to keep his subjects constantly distracted to avoid a revolution. Yatsenyuk, Poroshenko, etc. wanted to fight a war because a crisis is a good opportunity to eliminate business and political opponents, steal, and because they expect to funnel Western aid money into their own Swiss bank accounts. The focus should be on saving lives, not helping Ukrainian and Russian politicians torment their people with this civil war they've cooked up together.","Russia today is a capitalist dictatorship. The current civil war is essentially a fight between Putin and his band of oligarchs versus Poroshenko and his oligarchs..If only Ukraine was lucky enough to go back to the horrors of Soviet communism: a life expectancy higher than today, a gdp per capita three times what it is right now, a lack of devastating oligrach-run civil wars. Terrible.",Very interesting. I can't find a thing in the US news spelling out what Russia got in the deal. This is another clue that Putin got all he wanted and they're too embarrassed to admit they got their heads handed to them again. Maybe they should just leave him alone finally as he's been fighting this battle with the West for at least the last 13 years that I know of. This still won't stop the US from overthrowing other countries with the use of the CIA. I can't believe that my US Government has turned into nothing but a treacherous tyrant. It started with Bush and got worse with Obama so both parties are guilty.,"Sasa.If your information is correct, this is how it was supposed to work out after the coup. The NWO gets to finance these next 2 years and rape the Ukrainian people. Russia gets it's NG paid in full without any discount over the next 2 years and when the South Stream pipeline is finished before the end of 2015, Russia doesn't have to send any NG through Ukraine which is better for everyone. Russia gets it's buffer zone and no NATO for Ukraine. Russia can do business with Ukraine with a Federal Government and Russia saves 30b when it collects its 3b at the end of 2015. The difference is that the NWO (banks) replace Russia as a lender, Russia saves 30b and gets full price for it's NG, Russia has it's National Security issues resolved, and Ukraine and its people get the shaft. Well done NWO. I though Putin was in a lot of trouble this time when he got caught holding the bag when the Feb.21 agreement was broken, but he's ended up with an even better deal. Some people don't like him but he is about as smart as they come. If you've followed what he's done with NG over the last 13 years, he is just plain brilliant.","It's pretty obvious after the IMF announced that it was giving the Illegitimate coup a 17.5b loan, which was done on April 30th, that Putin has won big time.  That loan is the basis for another 15b to be added on. Putin has kicked Obama in the groin and he is down on his knees trying to catch his breath. The game is pretty much over except for letting the US and EU save some face rather than being totally humiliated. The coup in Kiev announced that it has lost Eastern Ukraine. May 1 was probably the day that Russia could have legally shut off the flow of NG. Ukraine will pay Russia what it owes them for NG. The New World Order (Bilderberg Group) ends up funding the 32.5b Ukraine needs and will suck the last drop of blood out of the Ukrainian people over the next few years. Ukraine will agree to never join NATO and SouthernEastern Ukraine will have a Federal system of government so it can work with Russia as it wishes. The South Stream pipeline will be finished by the end of 2015 at which time Russia can totally bypass Ukraine if it is agreed with Ukraine. Russian troops with stay on the border to ensure that the treacherous US, EU, and Kiev coup implement their part of the agreement. The big winner in this was the NWO. Russia will also be a big winner if it doesn't have to invade SouthernEastern Ukraine."
Nelson,,,,Anyone who thinks Putin annexed Crimea due to its historical and cultural ties to Russia is a fool. Crimea is a poor region and will be a burden to Russia. He is doing this purely for strategic military reasons.,"It is true, it is true, say such people with no more proof than to offer up a Google search that will turn up fellow conspiracy theorists.  The writer conveniently leaves out some very important facts such as that the duly elected President shot and killed many Maidan protesters protesting his abandonment under Russian pressure of previous plans to strengthen ties with Europe.  It was this use of force against his own people that led many if not most of his political allies to abandon him.  If the writer truly believes that the former President abandoned the European proposal for the Russian one out of rational economic motives, then he must be willing to accept that Putin's takeover of Crimea and arming of the separatists are the actions of a liberator rather than a conqueror..It baffles me that there are those who are willing to believe that the ouster of Yanukovych was the result of Machiavellian plotting of the US and Ukrainian fascists rather than the rational actions of the Ukrainian people acting on their fear of the Russian Bear and their desire for a European living standard.  Doesn't the simpler explanation make more sense?","I am just amazed at how many commenters a) believe RussiaPutin deserve to control Ukraine because it is in their backyard or because many eastern Ukrainians are Russian speakers, b) believe that the USA is at fault here because we have through dirty tricks machinated the revolt in Ukraine, which has been carried out purportedly only by fascists, c) call the Ukrainian revolt a coup, perpetrated against a freely elected and legitimate government, d) are willing to believe any conspiracy theory about fascists, the USA, NATO, etc., rather than accept that Putin is engaging in demagogic, bullying behavior against a neighboring country.  To those of you who argue against American hypocrisy: the fact that it was wrong of us to march into Iraq does not mean we should be mute in the face of this international transgression by Russia.  To those of you who argue that the legitimate government in Ukraine was overthrown by a coup, I can only shake my head in wonder and say that a government that fires indiscriminately on its own people and kills scores of them has lost its legitimacy.  To those of you who argue your innumberable conspiracy theories about fascists, evil American intent and other hobgoblins, I can only say please get off your computers now because they are spying on you.","Here are examples of absurd conclusions:  Because white people perpetrated slavery, white people have no business speaking out against slavery.  Because men prevented women from voting, men have no business speaking out against Republican efforts at vote suppression.  Well here is an equally false conclusion:  Because the USA illegally made war against Iraq, Americans have no business speaking out against Vladimir Putin's saber rattling on the borders of Ukraine.  And yet this is the tone of most of the commenters who reach the top of the Readers' Picks on this and other editorialsarticles on Russia vis-a-vis Ukraine.  I am frankly dumfounded by this level of block-headedness among the NYT Commentariat.  You would think from many of these that Putin is in fact a freedom-fighter rather than a thug, or that Ukraine suffered an illegal coup against its legitimate head of state.  Here's some facts: Putin suppressed freedom of the press in Russia and is now at the head of a vast propaganda machine directed at miscommunication of what's going on in Ukraine; Putin did anything by all means necessary to vanquish his political opposition and keep himself in power; Putin placed his cronies at the head of Russian industries; Yanukovich turned against the will of Ukraine's parliament to embrace Russia rather than the EU; Yanukovich fired on his own people engaging in peaceful protest; Yanukovich built himself a palace to rival Louis XIV on money he stole from the Ukrainian people.","But if Putin demands more autonomy for Crimea, so be it..Now there's a constructive world view.

Fact is that the US and UK (which is not part of Europe) have rightfully lost a lot of credibility with many Eropeans, also because of the NSA spying, so why do we expect that they now just fall in line with our explanations of what happened with that palne ? The whole Ukrainian affair has been as much about that people's yearning for less political corruption as it has been for the western strategy to expand Nato and sever Eurasian ties for western economic interests. Since when was the US ever really concerned about human lives, freedom and democracy ? Not in my life time for sure, but that does not mean that i'm a blind Putin fan either, however some fair balance is in order.","Our interest to ultimately destabilize Putin has nothing to do with bringing a 'liberal' system or democracy to that part of the world, it's purely economic stupid and as little democratic as our plutocratic dictatorship here in the US..That's why this whole campaign stinks and is so hypocritical, not becuase many people think Putin is a good guy! Let's also not forget what the NSA has done to our reputation as a beacon of hope and individual liberty lately.","I'm sure that Putin is no good guy or uncorrupted democrat  but neither are most of our politicians here in the 'democratic' west.  Personally i would like to know a bit more about Mr. Navalny and what politics he stands for, before i can even seriously consider his opinions. Is he not just another neocon aiming at privatizing  and selling out the Russian economy at the expense of the living standard of the population at large ?

So how is it that Putin is so corrupt when the really corrupt oligarchs who looted Russia have all sought refuge for themselves and the billions they liberated by introducing democracy and privatization in post soviet Russia in London, New York, Switzerland etc. If some of what I read in the Times is accurate it would seem that Putin is more interested in a clawback of Russian wealth and nation ripped off by the oligarchs and NATO, and not in enriching himself like the usual crew we back, the Saudis, Mubarak,the Shah or for that matter our own bankers.

Scott,,,,"I think it's extremely dangerous to frame this civil war as a Ukraine vs Russia war. All the evidence that is being rolled out as proof of Russia's involvement is dubious (at best) and reminiscent of the evidence that was sold to the public to justify the Iraq war...From what I've seen and read so far, it looks like Putin has been the only one trying to get everyone involved to sit down at the negotiating table.",Make no mistake Europeans are weak. They have no stomach to do what is necessary in a world with evil.  They will continue to appease Putin just like they have done other virtual dictators.,"I have very close friends in Mariupol, which is clearly the destination of this boldest and most obvious incursion by the Russians. They are not even pretending any longer. And the Ukraine military and local militias are no match for Russian regular troops which are headed their way.  This port and huge steel making town will be a nice jewel in their continued destruction of eastern Ukraine and significant portions of the Ukrainian economy with it...The West is totally complicit in this because we continue to allow Putin to have it both ways. He blatantly lies in public about the level of Russian involvement and no one calls him on it. Merkel calls and asks for explanations and he lies and she accepts it. Sadly, the US is not much better. We should release our intelligence once and for all, prove who shot down MH17, prove that we know about specific troop movements and weaponry that have gone into the area and put and end to all this equivocation and misdirection.","I don't know about thee faces but I've long thought that since Clinton was the first black President, Obama is the first Jewish President: he's a Rorschach test for everyone's prejudices.

With regard to Ukraine, we need to resist Putin and can't allow him to stay there. We have no moral standing thanks to our invasion of Iraq, but Putin needs to feel deep costs for his actions, via sanctions and economic pain. We should use this opportunity to take some kind of action in Syria, even if it is limited to bolstering Jordan's border with US troops and providing more humanitarian relief for refugees. Our presence there will remind Putin that he can't concentrate troops in Ukraine if he potentially needs them elsewhere.

Paul Cohen,1,,,"Mr. Neil MacFarquhar, ..Vladimir Putin is pretty cagey.  ..President Obama demonstrated his deep concern for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people by flying in happy meals, other supplies and ordering a sustained bombing of Iraq until their plight is fully addressed.  Wrong.  In truth, Iraqi humanitarian needs is a just a convenient available excuse for public consumption.   Mr. Obamas primary reason for authorizing a second round of military intervention is really about protecting American interests: reverting once again to the failed policy of military might to check ISIS advance in order to counter the growing threat of instability spreading throughout the Middle East.  ..Its almost as if Vladimir Putin is following the lead and mocking the U.S. by ordering the Russian military trucks to invade Ukraine also out of compassion for humanitarian needs.",,,,,,,,,
Diana Moses,,1,,"I see an asymmetry of power between the Western impulses in Ukraine and the Russian energy pushing back, but I also see some symmetrical mirroring of antagonism, both in words and deeds.  To the extent we are adding to the antagonism without actually affecting Russia's estimate of costbenefit, I think we are making things worse, but if economic sanctions will, in the long run, motivate Putin to modify his behavior, then maybe we should impose them, but more quietly.","Do we get more cooperation when we characterize a leader as having been humiliated by flaws in his strategy?  I thought we were trying to teach sectarian groups in various countries not to take a winner-take-all attitude.  The economic woes in Russia maybe give us an opening to get what we want?  Then we should go for that and not the emotional satisfaction of trying to get Putin to eat crow, it seems to me.  But for all I know a personality like Putin's enjoys the humiliation game, so my question really isn't meant rhetorically.","I don't want to be blaming our diplomats for Putin's behavior, or for Ukrainians', but I also feel as if I have no real idea of what our role has been in the creation of this mess...On the other hand, here we all are, however we got here.  I found this column's assessment helpful, in part because it doesn't downplay the difficulties but it also doesn't buy into seeing Putin as grander than he is.",Putin's reaction to Yanukovych's ouster reminds me less of a religious crusade and more of what a control-freak who has just been served with surprise divorce papers might do.,Putin's reaction to Yanukovych's ouster reminds me less of a religious crusade and more of what a control-freak who has just been served with surprise divorce papers might do.,"We turned (with not stellar results, of course) to Putin to try to have some positive influence over Assad; who plays Putin to Putin's Assad?",,,,
hadarmen,,,1,"I do not  agree, If I were in Putin shoes, I would like  keep Ukraine as an ally believe it is way more important than the  Cuba. ..He is not repeating the old  USSR  mistake, You are totally missing the point here. It is like let Mexico join the China political axis, really, is that so.","I believe EU should seriously consider what helps much broader reach to peripheral Europe. It is not all about Mercedes and  Chanel...Slinging mud  to the Ukraine politicians for selling short to Nation the KGB mob master  Putin is always easy and  cheap way. ..But ..Let.s remember , what ferocious economical calamity has been raging in Greece last 5 years. ..What about Bulgaria,Romania, even Hungary. ..Ukraine is utmost  important for Russia for many geopolitical reasons. This is not buying but investing, it is mandatory, there is no free bread. ..What EU did so far for eastern European nations other than giving them austerity chalice. ..You cannot keep people under one roof only for human rights etc.  without economy. Ask Greek  people what happened to their human rights, losing pensions, halving down the salaries, losing health insurances etc. these are not human right issues. ..If EU wants to win in eastern Europe, they should start spending money before it is too late.","My question is ..What Greece is lost to Troika? ..a- Grace.b- Money.c- Jobs.d- Pensions.e- Health insurance.f- Freedom.g- all above and more . ..What EU austerity policy proved, If Ukraine really would like to join EU? ..We(EU) promise that you(Ukraine) are going to starve as much as now...IT is not the Putin all evil, AUSTERITY made people lost their faith to EU.",,,,,,,
Sergey,,1,,"So, on the other hand, if this is all true (why not?) this report also states that:.1. Putin's intentions are not extended farther than East Ukraine (so Poland and Baltic countries may stop worrying).2. The plans to get the whole Eastern Ukraine are mostly failed by now. Kharkiv and other cities did not fit into the strategy..3. The invasion as such was never in the plans (i.e. russian army was not, in fact, in business here).","The question is: how to punish Putin and Russia for taking Crimea, supporting rebels and at the same time make it as cheap as possible for the rest of the world. It seems like there is still no solution for that. I think that instead of sanctions, the EUUS might just require to pay to Ukraine some significant money for Crimea, for like next 10-20 years. That would probably turn the political case into financial one and make everyone happy. The war is only profitable when you sell weapons, not when you actually participate in it.","It seems like the US and Europe want to make Putin to choose between money and honor. I guess, that this whole situation will just show how high does he value the honor. In the meantime, with every new sanction, it becomes increasingly harder to make a step back. ..Aside to this, many commenters here seem to be inclined that Putin really does want the eastern part of Ukraine. I guess, he does not. He supports rebels just to make Ukrainian government spend their money to the war and to make Ukraine financially unstable, forcing the government change to a pro-russian one. Crimea is another story, though...PS. Yes, I do read US and European news, but mostly comments. I just want to know what average american or european people think of all this.","Jeff, in order to answer your questions, let's recall the whole sequence of events right after Yanukovich was deposed from power and fled. It became clear that the power is shifted to ultimately pro-western politics, who will do whatever EU and US tell them to do. Therefore, it became immediately clear that Ukraine is ready to drop or terminate any kind of agreements with Russia in favor of EUUS and EUUS will support Ukraine in these attempts. First, Russia was expecting an eventual loss of the Crimea naval base. Second, Russia was expecting Ukraine to become a NATO member (with all those mutually-dependent military industry and secrets and so on). In these circumstances there was impossible to just wait and trust EUUS that it will not happen. Because such things did happen before. So, Putin had to act fast, although it now has a long-term consequences. I think I do not have to explain how much sovereignity you can lose as soon as you expect to lose your military presense in Black Sea and have the enemy (NATO) around you. Why is that so hard to understand? Since the fall of USSR, our soldiers and tanks were strictly inside our borders (except 2008 maybe), now we are still there and look where NATO is now. Is that also a gesture of a trust and friendship? No surprises, though.",,,,,,
